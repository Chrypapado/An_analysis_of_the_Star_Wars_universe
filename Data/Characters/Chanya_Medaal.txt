Serjay Thul reluctantly accepted her help and sent an Imperial hero to assist her. During that time Chanya was stationed at [[Outpost Eudor]] in the [[Kaamos Territory]]. She asked the Imperial to strike against the mercenary group called the [[Blood Company]] and also directed him to assist others at the outpost. She later made a holo-call to congratulate the Imperial on his efforts, though Serjay Thul began to see her as a threat and wanted to quietly eliminate her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0427\u0435\u043d\u044c\u044f \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0430\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Medaal, Chanya}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Biologists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
