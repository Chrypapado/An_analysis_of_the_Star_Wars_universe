Like fellow [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], C'baoth was arrogantly sure of his own skills and talents, believed himself to be a peerless warrior and philosopher, and viewed non-[[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitives]] as inferior. A controversial figure among his own peers, C'baoth was regarded as the epitome of a Jedi Master by some, while others were distrustful of him.\n\nDuring his exemplary, if unorthodox, career, C'baoth settled a number of conflicts. He notably participated in the demobilization of [[Ando/Legends|Ando]], defeated a [[Marauding Dark Jedi|band]] of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] in the [[Elrood sector/Legends|Elrood sector]], put an end to the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention|Ascendancy Contention]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], and helped his colleague [[Tra's M'ins]] mediate the [[Duinuogwuin\u2013Gotal conflict]]. Above all that, he also found [[Time/Legends|time]] to [[Jedi training/Legends|train]] a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], the young Human female [[Lorana Jinzler]].\n\nC'baoth was the main proponent of the [[Outbound Flight Project|''Outbound Flight'' project]], which he envisioned as being the precursor to the discovery of unknown species who could be taught the ways of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. However, C'baoth, like ''Outbound Flight'', was ultimately doomed by his arrogance and events outside of his control. With the failure of his vision and the destruction of ''Outbound Flight'' at the hands of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]] led by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], also known as Thrawn, C'baoth eventually fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] when he submitted to his anger and attempted to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Thrawn. He himself died when a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[radiation bomb]] exploded inside of the expedition's main [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Outbound Flight]]''.\n\n[[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] alter-ego of the authoritarian [[Politics/Legends|politician]] Palpatine, would later use recovered samples of C'baoth's [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] as the [[Prime clone|template]] for the insane [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] named [[Joruus C'baoth]]. That clone became the guardian of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Palpatine's private treasury, and later worked with [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] Thrawn during his [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]] against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Attended Jedi Training Center on Kamparas 2\\15\\90 to 8\\33\\8 PE.

He notably served as part of the [[Ando Demilitarization Observation Group|Demilitarization Observation Group]] stationed on the [[Ocean/Legends|oceanic]] planet of Ando, where the native [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] [[Subspecies/Legends|subspecies]] endlessly feuded with each other over mineral rights. A primary observer within the group, the Jedi from Bortras encountered another member of the task force, the ambitious [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] Palpatine of the [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]]. The two got along, and when they returned to Coruscant, C'baoth and Palpatine established a long-standing friendship that helped shape the development of C'baoth's career.<ref name=\"RPGRCR\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref>\n\nA few years after the events on Ando, the [[Council of Reassignment/Legends|Council of Reassignment]] appointed Jorus C'baoth as Palpatine's personal adviser on Jedi-related matters. During his tenure as a member of the senator's staff, the Jedi discussed the [[Extragalactic Society]], often referred to as ExGal, a community of [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] devoted to the search for life outside the galaxy. The two friends shared a mutual interest for the ExGal's ambitious project. However, a couple of years before the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]]<ref name=\"RPGRCR\" /> in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], C'baoth received visions of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] growing stronger. Intent on searching for the sources of his premonitions, the Jedi from Bortras chose to leave the service of Palpatine. He was reassigned once again and began his inquiries, which led him to the [[Elrood sector/Legends|Elrood sector]], in the Outer Rim. In that remote area of the galaxy, C'baoth discovered a group of [[Marauding Dark Jedi|marauding]] [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] who [[Dark Jedi uprising|brought terror]] to the [[Sector/Legends|sector]]. With the help of a small strike team of fellow Knights, C'baoth vanquished the rogue Force-users.<ref name=\"RPGRCR\" /> Unbeknownst to him, his old friend Palpatine himself was a powerful darksider, a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] known as [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Sidious.<ref name=\"Plagueis\">[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref>\n\n===Rise to mastery===\n{{Quote|Officially assumed the title of Jedi Master 4\\3\\74 PE.|Galactic Senate records on Jorus C'baoth|Dark Force Rising}}\n[[File:Lorana.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lorana Jinzler]], C'baoth's [[Padawan]].]]\nImmediately following the victory in the Elrood sector, C'baoth bestowed the title of Jedi Master upon himself,<ref name=\"RPGRCR\" /> a move that was quite unorthodox.

The High Council had received an anonymous [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]], alerting the Order that a factory named [[Trinkatta Starships]] had started building fifty experimental droid starfighters. Worried that these new ships were commissioned by an ally of the Republic plotting a civil war, the Councilmen sent [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]] to ascertain the identity of the one who paid for the starfighters. Master Jorus C'baoth was summoned by the Council, who asked him not to notify Palpatine or any other Senators of Galia's secret mission until they have solid evidence identifying the buyer.<ref name=\"SLJ\">''[[Episode I Adventures 1: Search for the Lost Jedi]]''</ref>\n\nJorus C'baoth's diplomatic career went on.

The question was whether the line of ascent to the function of [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] should go to the [[House of Organa/Legends|House of Organa]] or one of the other [[Noble/Legends|patrician]] bloodlines. After the third voting deadlock, the Alderaanians appealed to the Senate to resolve that matter.

Despite his long-standing friendship with Palpatine, who ran for the [[Galactic Republic Chancery election, 32 BBY|impending election]], C'baoth offered his support to Senator [[Bail Antilles/Legends|Bail Antilles]] of Alderaan, another potential nominee. The Jedi Watchman was seen in the company of the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] senator during a gathering on the [[Perlemian Orbital Facility]], a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] Coruscant.<ref name=\"Plagueis\" />\n\nAt some point, the Jedi diplomat took a female Human named [[Lorana Jinzler]] as his Padawan to train. C'baoth's relationship with his good-natured and humble apprentice was unusually tense.

At first, the project excited both C'baoth and Palpatine,<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" /> and the Jedi played a highly instrumental role in convincing the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Republic Senate]] to authorize and fund what became known as \"[[Outbound Flight Project]].\" During its development, the whole project was maintained in secrecy. The Republic never made any information about the Outbound Flight available to the broader populace.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" /> Since the planned expedition would pass through the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] of the galaxy, it was decided that its crew members would bring their families so they could plant a few colonies on the way.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\">''[[Survivor's Quest]]''</ref> Although the Republic had its official policy regarding the mission of ''Outbound Flight'', C'baoth had his own designs for the project &mdash; he envisioned it as being the catalyst for the discovery of other Force-sensitive species who might be taught the way of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nHowever, as time went by, the enthusiasm of the [[Politics/Legends|political]] class about C'baoth's brainchild began to weaken. It soon became apparent that the ''Outbound Flight'' project was in jeopardy of being sidelined by the Republic's bureaucracy when the [[Financial Appropriations Committee]] of the Senate imposed a series of budget cuts. Furthermore, the Jedi Order also started to step back from the project. While Grand Master Yoda had agreed to assign several Jedi to the project, in the end of the day he was thinking of allowing only one or two. But Master C'baoth had not yet said his last word, and he was ready to spitefully fight back and raise a fuss in front of the Chancellor himself.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n===Mission to Barlok===\n{{Quote|Actually, it was an inspired suggestion. Master C'baoth is quite good at the sort of mediation the Barlok situation so sorely needs. I should have thought of it myself.|Palpatine|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\nWhen C'baoth and his Padawan, Lorana Jinzler, met with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to discuss the Outbound Flight project, Palpatine told them that if C'baoth settled a dispute on the planet of [[Barlok]], he would do all he could to make Outbound Flight possible.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nAfter the first day of mediation, they met [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his Padawan, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who had been sent by [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]], who was suspicious of C'baoth. C'baoth sent them away with Jinzler while he went to mediate. After Kenobi, Skywalker and Jinzler had discovered a terrorist threat, C'baoth had them stationed with [[Jerv Riske]], a bodyguard hired by [[Passel Argente/Legends|Passel Argente]] of the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]]. They failed to stop the remote missile that targeted all the people involved in the meeting, but C'baoth caught the missile in a Force grip and convinced the assembly to resolve their differences for the people of Barlok.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nFollowing that mission, much to her own surprise, C'baoth asked the Jedi High Council to promote his Padawan Lorana Jinzler. She was knighted shortly before the departure of the ''Outbound Flight'', which C'baoth forced her to board.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n===Launch of the ''Outbound Flight''===\n{{Quote|It's quite impressive.''\"<br />\"''It's more than just impressive.

C'baoth, though, did not suspect that Palpatine would also be the one to secretly sabotage the project. Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's Sith persona, had C'baoth [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]] in the disguise of a [[Blood/Legends|blood]] test shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight project, knowing he would be of later use. Sidious also sent his henchman [[Kinman Doriana]] ahead of the ''Outbound Flight'' with the purpose of destroying it, thus effectively killing several dozen Jedi in one fell swoop.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nAs planned, C'baoth was one of the six Jedi Masters aboard the project when it departed from [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]] in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]]. Once the ''Outbound Flight'' was launched, C'baoth increasingly took control over all of the ship's aspects, even going so far as to take Force-sensitive children away from their parents in the middle of the night to be trained as Jedi. By establishing himself as the de facto leader over all aspects of the ship, even overruling the captain of the vessel, he earned the resentment of the colonists who had initially joined the ''Outbound Flight'' to seek a better life.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nWhen the ''Outbound Flight'' entered the Unknown Regions, it was encountered by two local species, the [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]] as well as the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]]. [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], the leader of the [[Picket Force Two/Legends|Chiss picket force]], contacted C'baoth and boarded the ''Outbound Flight'' to meet with him, but C'baoth refused to comply with Thrawn's request to leave [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Space]]. As the Vagaari fleet stormed towards the ''Outbound Flight'', C'baoth performed a [[Force meld]] to [[Mind trick/Legends|trick]] the enemy. At that moment Thrawn launched [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I/Legends|Vulture droids]] to engage the confused Vagaari, creating a large [[Wound in the Force|disturbance in the Force]] which overwhelmed the meld participants.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nDuring the disturbance, C'baoth and his fellow Jedi failed to detect the Chiss forces that were sneaking in, and Thrawn managed to systematically destroy the weapon clusters of the ''Outbound Flight'', killing almost every Jedi aboard. Enraged, the Jedi Master gave into his anger, succumbed to the dark side and [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Choke|Force choked]] Thrawn across space from ''Outbound Flight''{{'s}} bridge itself. His apprentice sensed his fall, and tried to reach her former master in time to help him, but it was too late. However, before C'baoth could kill Thrawn, Doriana saved Thrawn's life when he activated the secondary command layer pre-set in the Vulture droids, which then rammed and blasted open the ''Outbound Flight''. The final wave of Vultures employed a [[radiation bomb]] of Chiss design on the ship. C'baoth, along with all but fifty-seven of the passengers and Lorana aboard, perished.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nIt was due to C'baoth's arrogance and draconian behavior that the survivors of ''Outbound Flight'', who were discovered in [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], had such a resentment and hatred for the Jedi.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Who is it we've brought aboard the ''Chimaera''?

Due to deteriorating sanity from the unstable [[Spaarti cloning cylinder]]s as well as a long isolation, even Joruus C'baoth forgot his true origins and believed himself to be the original Master C'baoth.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nWithout formal Jedi training, Joruus openly used the dark side of the Force in his rule of the mixed population of Wayland. After being discovered by Grand Admiral Thrawn, he used his skills to coordinate [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] attacks in an effort to ultimately find an apprentice of his own.

He spoke in a husky baritone voice.<ref name=\"COD\" />\n\nC'baoth was known to have believed in the \"inherent superiority\" of his own kind, the Jedi&mdash;an odd [[speciesism]] of sorts: his unapologetic conviction was that the Jedi were far above the galaxy's average non-Force users, and therefore they had the right-to-rule over them, be they outlaws, thieves, bureaucrats, or senators. His proud attitude of superiority caused several Jedi to be disturbed by his views, including his own Padawan Lorana Jinzler&mdash;to whom he was especially brutal, considering he was her Jedi Master. But it was precisely because of his brash, arrogant, and powerful personality&mdash;not to mention his blunt, and often insensitively harsh attitudes and demeanor&mdash;that very few individuals dared to bring this unflattering galaxy-view and trait to C'baoth's attention.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nC'baoth was also extremely arrogant in his dealings, not only with non-Force users, but also with his fellow Jedi. That arrogance, as it combined with his often severe attitudes, divided many Jedi on their perception and/or approbation of the Jedi Master. Some believed that he was the consummate model of what it meant to be a Jedi, while others vehemently disagreed with his methods and remained very wary of him and his extremist views. C'baoth was among the very few Jedi Masters who indulged an unqualified admiration of Anakin Skywalker, and the prodigious youth, in turn, reciprocated the same reverent feeling towards the awesome, if not wholly venerable, Jedi figure.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|As a general rule, nearly all Jedi struck [Kinman Doriana] as pompous and arrogant and obscenely sure of themselves.
