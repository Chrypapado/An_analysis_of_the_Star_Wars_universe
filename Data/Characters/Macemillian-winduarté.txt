He began his career as chief bartender officer in the [[reclamation cruiser]] ''[[Two-For-One]]''. In this capacity, he traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], indulged his [[snit-spore]] habit, and learned a great deal of useless trivia. He went by the nickname '''Mace Windu''', possibly in reference to the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|by that name]] who had won the [[Battle of Skor II]] in [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]] and become a hero to the Squib people.\n\n==Biography==\nWhen the ''Two-for-One'' visited [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 left the ship to meet with some locals. He got delayed at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], and the cruiser left without him. Suddenly alone in an unknown place, the Squib was forced to accept odd jobs to get by.\n\n[[File:Squib_MEAS.jpg|thumb|left|Mace at work with Aguilae]]\nHe eventually became indebted to [[Aguilae]], a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] who ran a business called [[Jawa Traders]] in the spaceport. Aguilae was having trouble managing the business, so she took Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 on as a salesman and forgave his debts in return. He mainly worked at her droid store in Mos Eisley.\n\nWhile at work one day, the Squib trader acquired an accounting droid known as [[CZ-3/Legends|CZ-3]]. Unbeknownst to Mace, however, the criminal businessman [[Opun Mcgrrrr|Opun \"Black Hole\" Mcgrrrr]] was looking for the droid because it had information that he wanted to use to blackmail [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. Aguilae made the best of the situation and sold the droid before Mcgrrrr could find it at her store. Aguilae had second thoughts, however, and soon after decided to recover the droid.\n\nCZ-3 was by this time on a Jawa [[Sandcrawler/Legends|Sandcrawler]] run by [[Het Nkik/Legends|Het Nkik's]] tribe. Aguilae and Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 tracked the droid there, but CZ-3 was no longer present. Instead, they found Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. The two barely escaped with their lives.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe name Mace Windu dates to the earliest incarnation of ''[[Star Wars]]'', a [[The Star Wars: Story Synopsis|13-page treatment]] written by [[George Lucas]] in 1973. Twenty years later, the [[West End Games]] sourcebook ''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]'' applied the name to the character detailed here. Then in November 1996, [[Pablo Hidalgo]]'s short story \"[[Spare Parts (short story)|Spare Parts]]\" gave this character's full name as Macemillian-winduart\u00e9.\n\nAfter [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']] re-introduced the name [[Mace Windu]] as a powerful Jedi, a [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] article (also by Pablo Hidalgo) served as a kind of [[retcon]], making it reasonable to assume that the Squib's name is somehow related to the Jedi's due to the Jedi's heroic status on [[Skor II]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=There's Many a Slip Betwixt Cup and Lip}} {{ID|Mace Windu}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|11|Spare Parts (short story)|Spare Parts}} {{1stID|Macemillian-winduart\u00e9}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Mos Eisley Adventure Set]]''\n*{{FFCite|60|AST11, ''R5-D4 Astromech Droid''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Unknown Regions]]''\n*{{DB|droid|r5d4|R5-D4|archivedate=20101009094510}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Squibs]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
