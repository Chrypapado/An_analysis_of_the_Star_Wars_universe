''Galaxies'', however, classes him as a Bothan, and his appearance is nothing like that character on which he is based. Thus, it cannot be [[canon]]ically said that the two are the same, though it was most likely the game designer's intention, as ''Galaxies'' possesses several other continuity errors.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Zekka Thyne}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thyne, Zekka}}\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
