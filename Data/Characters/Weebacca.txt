He was a childhood friend of fellow Wookiee [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. When his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] was [[Invasion of Kashyyyk|invaded]] and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], the Wookiee dropped his then-current dealings and rushed to fight for the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] defense. Nevertheless, he turned into a double agent for the Empire prior to the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] to free the planet [[4 ABY/Legends|several years]] later. However, Chewbacca and the ex-smuggler [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], both members of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], caught Weebacca trying to escape the destruction of Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Hindane Darcc/Legends|Hindane Darcc's]] [[Darcc's Palace|palace]] along with the commanders of the Imperial forces on Kashyyyk, Moff Darcc himself, and the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] slaver [[Pekt]]. With his treachery revealed, Weebacca was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by Chewbacca.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|That's one way to deal with Weebacca.|Han Solo, in response to Chewbacca's slaying of Weebacca|Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds}}\nWeebacca was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] and a longtime childhood friend of fellow Wookiee and [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] native [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. Weebacca was always in need of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and had a love for the game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]]; it was not long before he got into [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] and [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]]. He dropped contact with his family and Chewbacca for a long [[Time/Legends|time]], but he eventually resurfaced as a runner of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] through the [[Kashyyyk system/Legends|Kashyyyk system]] under the nose of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] patrols. He hated the Empire, and when his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Kashyyyk was [[Invasion of Kashyyyk|invaded]] and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], he dropped his lucrative smuggling career and rushed home to help his people. Nevertheless, Weebacca eventually became an agent for the Empire.<ref name=\"GB\" />\n\nDuring the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk (Galactic Civil War)|liberation]] of Kashyyyk from [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] slavers and the Empire in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"EA\" /> Weebacca was destroying a Trandoshan building near the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Kepitenochan]] when he was spotted by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] agents Chewbacca and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Despite the fact that they appeared to be fighting on the same side, seeing a lone Wookiee unharmed caught Solo's attention due to the carnage that had taken place against the Wookiees. Weebacca helped Chewbacca and Solo reoccupy Kepitenochan and rebuild the [[Government Tree]], with which the two New Republic agents hoped to contact the New Republic. However, the Imperials had installed three [[jammer]]s that prevented the agents from dispatching a message.<ref name=\"GB\" />\n\n[[File:WeebaccaKilledByChewbacca-SWGB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Weebacca is killed by Chewbacca.]]\nWeebacca claimed that the jammers were to be found in the city of [[Okikuti]] but did not go with Solo and Chewbacca to destroy them. When the New Republic agents and a company of Wookiees investigated the city&mdash;where they found no jammers&mdash;they were ambushed by Imperials, but Solo and the Wookiees were able to escape. Later, after the Wookiees destroyed Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Hindane Darcc/Legends|Hindane Darcc's]] [[Darcc's Palace|palace]], Weebacca tried to escape the planet with Darcc and the Trandoshan slaver [[Pekt]]&mdash;the leaders of the Imperial invasion forces&mdash;in an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|Imperial shuttle]]. However, Chewbacca and Solo spotted the Wookiee with the Imperials, and, with Weebacca's betrayal revealed, Chewbacca [[Death/Legends|killed]] Weebacca in a duel while Darcc and Pekt fled.<ref name=\"GB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWeebacca frequently got into trouble, and he was known for his habit of gambling&mdash;he particularly loved the game of sabacc. The Wookiee was a friend of Chewbacca during his childhood [[Standard year/Legends|years]], and the two were never cross with each other,<ref name=\"GB\" /> though Weebacca could be untrustworthy and petty at times. When in desperate need of large sums of credits, Weebacca was willing to take any job available, including posts as a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]]-for-hire.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|324|Weebacca}}</ref> He eventually betrayed the Wookiees by becoming a double agent for the Empire during his home planet's enslavement. He garnered a deep hatred for the Empire early in his life; nevertheless, he eventually joined the Empire prior to the liberation of Kashyyyk. Weebacca also had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|fur]] and was considered in his clan to be a \"small Wookiee with a big Wookiee's attitude.\"<ref name=\"GB\" /> His name contained that of the ancient Wookiee hero [[Bacca]], the first of the great [[Wookiee Chieftain|chieftains]] of Kashyyyk. In [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], the name \"Bacca\" meant \"friendly.\"<ref name=\"CNOK\">{{GamerCite|10|Callsigns: Names of Kashyyyk}}</ref> Weebacca sported a pair of [[Ryyk blade/Legends|ryyk blades]] as his main weapons during the battle of Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"GB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWeebacca made his only appearance in the [[2001]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' and its [[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns|expansion pack]]. He was first mentioned in the game's [[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|strategy guide]]. In-game, he is a \"hero\" for the Wookiee faction, and as such, he is a special unit that cannot be manufactured or produced. During several missions in the game, the player must keep Weebacca alive in order to complete the level.<ref name=\"GB\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Weebacca\n|de=Weebacca\n|fr=Weebacca\n|pt=Weebacca\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043a\u043a\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
