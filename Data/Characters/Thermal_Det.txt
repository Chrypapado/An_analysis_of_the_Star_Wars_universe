You got the data? Thanks. This weather out here was about to repave my exterior. I gotta get this onto the 'Net, thanks.|Thermal Det, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> a [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] named [[Drik Bandrik]] became upset with [[Kitster Chanchani Banai|Kitster Banai's]] persistent attempts to improve the lives of slaves on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. In order to ruin Kitster, [[Drik Bandrik]] framed him with a large number of fake crimes, including the supposed murder of [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]] [[Krin Vel]]. However, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for Kitster managed to find Krin Vel, who then proceeded to help Kitster compile evidence clearing his name. Kitster tasked the spacer with delivering this evidence to Thermal Det, a slicer who proceeded to put the information onto the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]. Thermal Det also revealed that Drik Bandrik tricked the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] by fabricating evidence that Kitster Banai led a slave revolt at [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] years ago. Thanks to Thermal Det, Jabba the Hutt soon learned of Drik's misgivings as a result, forcing the slaver to flee Tatooine.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThermal Det was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'',<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Players who performed a series of quests for Kitster in Mos Espa had to find Thermal Det and give him evidence clearing Kitster's name.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nThermal Det appears to have been named after the [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Kitster Banai}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Det, Thermal}}\n[[Category:Kitonaks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
