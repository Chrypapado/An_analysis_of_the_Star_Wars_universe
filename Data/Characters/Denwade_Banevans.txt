By [[10 BBY]], Banevans had achieved the rank of [[captain]] and was tasked with the protection of a [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport|conveyex]] [[train]], and fought off [[Beckett's gang]] during a [[Heist on Vandor|heist]]. However, he failed due to the train's wagons being separated by the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], leaving Banevans and two of his men behind.\n\n==Biography==\n===Icy assignment===\nDenwade Banevans was a [[human]] from the [[planet]] [[Carida]] who served in the [[Stormtrooper Corps]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] during its [[Imperial Era|reign]] across [[the galaxy]]. He was stationed as a [[range trooper]] with the rank of [[captain]] on the [[planet]] [[Vandor]], where he and his [[squad]] were assigned as security and surveillance for the [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport]] lines.<ref name=\"SoloOG\" /> In [[10 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]'' dates the portion of ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' set on [[Vandor]] to nine [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|founding]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the founding of the Empire to [[19 BBY]], therefore the events must take place in [[10 BBY]].</ref> the captain traveled on board the [[Hovertrain/Canon|hovertrain]] designated [[ICC-5537]] in order to protect its cargo of [[coaxium]] [[fuel]].\n\nWhile ICC-5537 was headed toward the [[Crispin Imperial Depository]], a [[Beckett's gang|gang]] of criminals led by the outlaw [[Tobias Beckett]] boarded the train using a stolen [[Y-45 armored transport hauler]]. The [[Starship|hauler]] dropped Beckett and two of his accomplices on top of the train, where they made their way along to the car containing the coaxium. Once they had confirmed its location, the hauler returned so they could attach it to the car; however, Banevans and his men emerged onto the roof of the rearmost train car and opened fire on Beckett's gang, preventing the attachments being made.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n===Battle on the train===\nBeckett returned fire while his accomplices, [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], began climbing down the car they were on to detach it from the rearward cars. The gang leader managed to [[Death|kill]] the range [[trooper]] who had progressed furthest toward him while the rest kept progressing along the top and side of the train, using their magnetic [[gription boot]]s to prevent themselves from falling.<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Beckett then managed to hit another trooper's boot, causing it to malfunction and preventing him from moving any further. When the train next twisted, the trooper was unable to avoid a rocky outcrop and was smashed from the surface of the vehicle out of view.<ref name=\"Junior Novel\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>\n\nThe troopers progressed across several cars, but just as they reached the car the criminals were on, Solo and Chewbacca severed the connection. The cars carrying the troopers were disconnected from the front half of the train and slowly ground to a halt, leaving the range troopers unable to confront the criminal gang. Both ICC-5537 and the coaxium were ultimately destroyed after the rival [[Cloud-Riders]] group attacked Beckett's men in order to steal the coaxium for themselves.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDenwade Banevans stood 1.80 [[meter]]s (5 [[foot]], 11 [[inch]]es) tall.<ref name=\"SoloOG\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nBanevans wore standard range trooper [[vambrace armor]] including magnetic gription boots and a [[synth-fur]] line [[kama]]. The captain carried a [[E-10R blaster rifle]] and [[water]]proof stowage packs for survival gear.<ref name=\"SoloOG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDenwade Banevans first appeared in the [[2018]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|Anthology]] film, ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'',<ref name=\"Solo\" /> and was first named in the accompanying reference book ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]'', which was written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]].<ref name=\"SoloOG\" /> Banevans' name was created as an homage to the [[1950s#1957|1957]] film [[Wikipedia:3:10 to Yuma|''3:10 to Yuma'']], being an [[Tuckerization|amalgamation]] of two characters, Ben Wade and Dan Evans.<ref name=\"Reference\">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/1159624220638240768|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=Yep.
