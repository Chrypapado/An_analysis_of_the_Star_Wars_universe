However, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] fiercely argued that Comark had little experience of governing a planet and Comark had to make do with a position within [[Renik]], the counter-espionage branch of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]].\n\n===Death Hunter project===\nIt was within Renik that Comark began to divert resources into his [[Death-Hunter Cyborg|Death Hunter]] project. Comark did not believe that the Galactic Empire could rely on [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] for its 'dirty work' and therefore worked to create perfect killing machines, transforming captured [[Human/Legends|Humans]] from nearby [[Bescane/Legends|Bescane]] into loyal [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] assassins. Comark used a company, [[Renikco]] located on the planet [[Jaemus/Legends|Jaemus]], as a front for his plans.\n\n===Downfall===\nHis scheme was eventually foiled by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] agents at his base on [[Zeta Zero Nine]], as a result of the information provided to the Alliance by Comark's own daughter, [[Amber Comark|Amber]]. In a fierce battle, Alliance agents were able to free nearly all of the kidnapped humans. They destroyed the facility, and it was believed that Moff Comark perished in the destruction.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|9|Death-Hunter}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Strongholds of Resistance]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Comark, Jesco}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moffs of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
