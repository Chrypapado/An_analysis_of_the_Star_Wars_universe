Known as the Great Warrior [[Poet/Legends|Poet]], Avamarivash was a large sponsor of the arts and was quite a different leader than his eventual successor [[Maravada]] the Silent as he frequently bedded many women and erected monuments to the glory of his people after fighting vicious wars. A history of Avamarivash's reign could be found in the [[Chamber of Speech]] in Kaleth up until the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]-era and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order's]] return to Tython.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0410\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0448\n}}\n\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Poets]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
