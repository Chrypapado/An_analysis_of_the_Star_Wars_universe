I am Sharack Breev.|Sharack Breev|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Sharack Breev''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sith Acolyte|acolyte]] who served as a loyal servant of [[Darth Baras]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Our lord and master Darth Baras bid me to impart my knowledge of this planet and help you track down the Jedi Master Yonlach.|Sharack Breev|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA native from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Sharack Breev knew the nuances of the desert better than her, and she often works as a scout and tracker. She wouldn't dare venture through any hostile regions, which includes the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]]. Eventually, she came into [[Darth Baras]]'s service and became one of his agents during the war.\n\n{{GameDS}}\nIn [[3643 BBY]], she made an encounter with one of [[Empire's Wrath|Baras' apprentices]] who was on Tatooine with a mission to find [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Yonlach]]. Sharack Breev helped the [[Sith Warrior]] retraced the trials of Yonlach's Padawan, [[Jaesa Willsaam]], whom Baras deemed a threat to his plans. She directed the Sith to [[Izzeebowe Jeef]] and assisted him in completing the [[Demon's Blood ritual]]. Breev later witnessed the Warrior confront and defeat a light side reflection of themselves, revealing Yonlach's location in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]]. She ran up to the Warrior, warning that their destination lay beyond the [[Forbidden Pass]], where no one has ever returned from. She refused to accompany the Warrior any further and returned to [[Mos Ila]] spaceport to report to Baras. Some time later, the Warrior returned unscathed, to the surprise of Breev. Realizing she let fear paralyze her, Breev decided to explore the Forbidden Pass herself and said her goodbyes to the Warrior.\n\nBreev later sent a message to the Warrior, explaining her successful journey beyond the Forbidden Pass and the discovery of Yonlach's hut, where the corpse of the deceased Jedi Master laid.\n{{Endgame}}\n\nDuring the [[Galactic War]], Breev became aware that Baras' apprentice had ascended to the position of the [[Emperor's Wrath]] and had executed Baras for [[Treason/Legends|treason]], prompting her to transfer to allegiance to the Wrath. She sent a message to the Wrath, informing her new master that she had spotted [[Lana Beniko]], the Sith accused of murdering [[Darth Arkous]] on [[Lehon]], on Tatooine attempting to get lodging with a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] clan. She attempted to shadow the fugitive but the Sith could sense her presence and fled to the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Jakarro]]'s ship and departed the planet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breev, Sharack}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Sith Empire individuals]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
