In reality, these Royal Protectors were dark side [[Dark Side Adept|adepts]], who drew upon the power of the [[Death/Legends|deceased]] [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Freedon Nadd]] to bolster their strength.\n\nIn [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], the Protectors were employed by [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] to protect both she and her daughter from the [[Beast Riders]], who had staged an [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|assault]] on the [[Iziz Royal Palace|Royal Palace]] of Iziz. They attempted to carry out their mission, but were defeated by the [[Beast Warrior Commando]]s who subsequently abducted Amanoa's daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Galia]].\n\nThe Royal Protectors were again active after the [[Battle of Iziz]], when Amanoa had perished. This time they were enlisted by her husband [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], as guardians for his secret underground stronghold under the Palace of Iziz. These guards were too defeated by [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], when they stormed Ommin's lair to rescue the captured [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]].\n\n{{Soldier-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Freedon Nadd Uprising]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|28|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 3}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Culture of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Military units]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Sith minions]]"}}}]}}}}
