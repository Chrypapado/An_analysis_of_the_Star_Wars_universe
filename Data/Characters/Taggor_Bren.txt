When he was old enough, he was marked with a tattoo around his right eye, representing one of the twin suns.\n\nWhen Taggor was out roaming the desert, he came upon a woman, clearly in trouble. Soon others came, offering food and supplies for the girl. He agreed, but went with them to be sure of what would happen to her. He soon discovered that they were gangsters of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Eventually Taggor moved out to other [[Star system/Legends|star systems]], becoming a bounty hunter.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Boba Fett \u00bd]] {{Co}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Topps|set=1994 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 2|cardname=Tim Bradstreet}} {{1stp}}\n*{{GalaxyCite|1|Taggor Bren: One Dangerous Bounty Hunter}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[The Art of Star Wars Galaxy: Volume Two]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|44}} {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2010 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 5|cardname=Sketch Cards}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Taggor Bren\n|ru=\u0422\u0430\u0433\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u0411\u0440\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bren, Taggor}}\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raiders]]"}}}]}}}}
