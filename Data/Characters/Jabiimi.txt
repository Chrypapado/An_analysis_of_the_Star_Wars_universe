They settled on the world around [[3000 BBY]]. The fact that they were widely ignored by the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] community, even during times of crisis, left them with a distrust of whichever government was in power. This distrust led to an open rebellion when the [[Jabiimi Loyalists]] aided the Republic forces and let them land on Jabiim. Then the [[Jabiimi Nationalists]] chose to aid the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy]] in what would be known as the conquest of Jabiim.\n\n{{Species-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:7:02]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: The Battle of Jabiim]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:9:01]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[CIS Shadowfeed Dispatch 14:9:08 Edition]]''\n*''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire: In the Shadows of Their Fathers]]''\n*[[Empire 36|''Empire'' 36]]\n*[[Empire 38|''Empire'' 38]]\n*[[Empire 40|''Empire'' 40]]\n*[[Rebellion 0|''Rebellion'' 0]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Expansion: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Jabiimi\n}}\n\n[[Category:Human races]]\n[[Category:Jabiimi| ]]"}}}]}}}}
