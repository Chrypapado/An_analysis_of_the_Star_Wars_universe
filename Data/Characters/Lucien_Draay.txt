I know this&mdash;because I am the son of Krynda ''and'' Barrison Draay&mdash;and at last, I can see my ''future''.|Lucien Draay|Knights of the Old Republic 35}}\n'''Lucien Draay''' was a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] during the era of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] who, in [[3964 BBY]], helped perpetrate the infamous [[Padawan Massacre]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. The [[Gender/Legends|son]] of [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Barrison Draay]] and half-Human, half-[[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] Jedi Master [[Krynda Draay]], Lucien was born the heir to the elite [[Draay family]], a dynasty of wealthy financiers. Barrison Draay was killed in the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] when Lucien was very young, and he was left to be raised by his mother, a famed [[Jedi Seer]] who paid little attention to Lucien after finding that he did not have her talent for [[Force vision/Legends|seeing the future]]. After several [[Standard year/Legends|years]] removed from [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] affairs entirely, Krynda began training a new class of young seers, but excluded Lucien&mdash;although the boy showed strong promise as a Jedi and had considerable natural talent with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], taking after his father, Lucien was left to be trained by family retainer [[Haazen]] while Krynda concerned herself with her seers. Krynda went on to form the [[Jedi Covenant]], a secret group of seers within the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] that was dedicated to keeping watch for the rise of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and after Lucien grew into an extremely capable young Jedi Knight, he was welcomed into the fold. Draay served as the Hand to the Covenant's [[First WatchCircle]], providing practical help and protection to the seers, and eventually becoming one of the Covenant's top on-the-ground leaders.\n\nIn the years before the Mandalorian Wars, Draay and his WatchCircle were assigned to the [[Jedi Tower]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] Taris, where they each took [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]]. Draay was responsible for training a young Human named [[Zayne Carrick]], who quickly proved himself to be the least of his class. In 3964 BBY, the seers of the First WatchCircle had a traumatic [[Rogue Moon Prophecy|shared vision]] that they interpreted to mean that one of their apprentices would bring about the ruin of the Jedi Order, and Draay responded by immediately ordering their execution to avert the prophecy. The massacre was carried out at a false Knighting ceremony in the Jedi Tower, but Carrick managed an unlikely escape from Taris, a public embarrassment that caused Draay and the WatchCircle to be reassigned. Carrick was pinned for the murders, and Draay continued a dogged pursuit that soon obsessed him completely, although Carrick continued to elude him and the Covenant at every turn. After the manhunt claimed the lives of Draay's colleagues [[Raana Tey]] and [[Feln]], Carrick was finally nabbed by First WatchCircle member [[Xamar]] while attempting to bring evidence to clear his name to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] on Coruscant, although Xamar agreed to turn state's evidence and take down Draay and the Covenant from the inside. However, a Jedi raid on the Covenant's [[Draay Estate]] headquarters was turned aside when Haazen revealed that he had been the true power behind the Covenant all along, and attempted to cause an [[Vindication|insurrection]] within the Jedi Order. Although Haazen planned to turn Draay to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] to lead a new army of Sith under Haazen's banner, Draay rejected his old trainer and worked together with Carrick to foil his schemes. Draay was heavily wounded in the process and was popularly believed to have died, but secretly retreated to a [[Draay 2|private moon]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] to live out his days as leader of a new [[True Covenant]] dedicated to keeping the Jedi teachings alive through any prophesied doom.\n\n==Biography==\n===Scion of the Covenant===\n{{Quote|But it was my destiny to have sight and second sight.

Lucien was born on the same [[Standard day/Legends|day]]<ref name=\"handbook\" /> in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]]<ref name=\"birthyear\" /> that [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] first encountered the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] in the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon's]] [[Beast Wars]], an event that would help lead to the cataclysmic destruction of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], a conflict that would claim Lucien's father's life.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> As a boy, Lucien was largely ignored by his mother, who was disappointed in his lack of talent as a seer, and primarily raised by his family's [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[9BD]] on the family's palatial [[Draay Estate|estate]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> Young Lucien was also often invited to summer with the similarly rich and elite [[House of Adasca|Adasca family]] on [[Arkania/Legends|Arkania]]&mdash;his father and Adasca patriarch [[Alok Adasca]] had been colleagues in finance&mdash;and struck up an acquaintance with [[Arkoh Adasca]], the heir to the [[Bioengineering/Legends|bioengineering]] giant [[The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania|Adascorp]].<ref name=\"kotor20\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 20|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 20]]</ref> While Lucien started to grow into a potential Jedi and prepared to lead the Draay family into the future, his mother remained devastated by her husband's death, and for four years she closed herself off from Jedi affairs. With few Jedi of her kind left after the devastation of the Great Sith War, the Jedi continued to send her promising seers to train, but Krynda turned away them all. That all changed one day in [[3993 BBY]], when a young Miraluka named [[Q'Anilia]] arrived at the Draay Estate and so enraptured Krynda with her potential that she agreed to teach her.<ref name=\"kotor9\" />\n\nOver the next several years, Krynda began to take on more [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]], including the volatile [[Togruta/Legends|Togruta]] [[Raana Tey]], the seasoned [[Feeorin]] warrior [[Feln]] and the cautious [[Khil]] [[Xamar]], while leaving Draay to be trained by family retainer [[Haazen]], a failed [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] who was an old friend of Barrison. As Lucien grew, however, he became a promising Jedi prospect, easily the best among his class with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. His talent caught the eye of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vandar Tokare]], who offered to bring him into the Jedi Order on a probationary trial, but Lucien's training continued to be hindered by his mother, who was afraid of him hurting her precious seers. Krynda believed that the class of Q'Anilia, Tey, Feln and Xamar was a group that she had foreseen that was powerful enough to avert the return of the Sith,<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> and formed the [[First WatchCircle]]<ref name=\"handbook\" /> of the secret society known as the [[Jedi Covenant]], dedicated to keeping watch for the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and doing what was needed to protect [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Although Krynda intended to leave her son out of the arrangement, Haazen interceded on Lucien's behalf, leading to his being named the Hand to the Jedi Covenant's [[First WatchCircle]], providing practical help to the group as a non-seer.<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> Although Draay was initially limited to handling travel arrangements, he inherited his father's dynamism and talent for combat, and eventually progressed into providing security and becoming the First WatchCircle's leader on the ground, as well as a Jedi Master.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> Along the way, he developed a close, pseudo-romantic relationship with Q'Anilia, his mother's first true student, that would persist for a number of years.<ref name=\"kotor32\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 32|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 32]]</ref>\n\nKey to Draay's contribution to the Jedi Covenant was his control of the [[Draay Trust]], a fund set up by Lucien's father to manage the family fortune and make money for charitable causes until a non-Jedi Draay heir arrived on the scene. Although Lucien ostensibly should have had no interest in the Draay Trust,<ref name=\"kotor12\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 12|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 12]]</ref> he and Covenant leadership used the trust's sizable funds as a lucrative bankroll for the organization's secret dealings.<ref name=\"kotor18\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 18|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 18]]</ref> As he became one of the leaders of the Covenant, Draay found other ways to contribute to the secret order's mission. Putting into action an idea from his mother, Draay formed a network of [[Covenant Shadow]] agents: Jedi who had been officially erased from the order's rolls so that they could dedicate their entire lives to the Covenant's mission. Answering directly to Draay, these agents were often sent in to do clandestine work.<ref name=\"kotor25\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 25]]</ref> One of the Shadows' main tasks was to covertly collect dangerous [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifacts]] for containment and experimentation, a task that Draay devoted much energy to coordinating. Hundreds of these trinkets were stored at the [[Sanctum of the Exalted]] on the planet [[Odryn]], a structure sacred to the [[Feeorin]] [[Species/Legends|species]] and open only to Feln&mdash;the Feeorin culture's hallowed [[Exalted]]&mdash;and his guests. Draay provided keys to the Sanctum to all of his Covenant Shadows, while also making sure that a [[Option Ossus|failsafe self-destruct option]] was wired into the Sanctum to destroy the whole thing should word of what the Covenant was doing there threaten to leak out.<ref name=\"kotor30\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 30|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 30]]</ref>\n\n===Dark prophecy===\n{{Quote|Is there any doubt what you saw?

The five members of the WatchCircle all took on apprentices on Taris, and Draay took over the training of [[Zayne Carrick]], a young Human from [[Phaeda/Legends|Phaeda]] who quickly proved himself to be the least of his Jedi class. Although Carrick was earnest in his desire to become a Jedi, the lad seemed to have horrific luck, and Draay viewed his Padawan's bumblings with both amusement<ref name=\"kotor0\" /> and sense of convenience&mdash;Carrick's travails allowed Draay to write him off as a lost cause and focus all his energies on his duties with the Covenant.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> Carrick's training coincided with the outbreak of the Mandalorian Wars between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders]], a topic that split the Jedi Order between [[Revanchist|those who wanted the Jedi to enter the conflict]] and those who believed the Jedi must stay uninvolved. Although Draay was an acquaintance of the [[Revan/Legends|bold young Jedi Knight]] who led the pro-war faction, ever-preoccupied by the Sith, Draay firmly believed that the Mandalorian conflict was not Jedi business.<ref name=\"kotor0\" />\n\nIn [[3964 BBY]], during a visit of several pro-war Jedi to Taris, Q'Anilia had a disturbing [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] that something dark had occurred in the vicinity, raising Draay's vigilance ahead of a final test of the WatchCircle's Jedi students.<ref name=\"kotor0\" /> That final test was a blind traverse of Taris' [[rogue moon]], an anomalous [[Planetoid/Legends|planetoid]] that traveled a reverse [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] from the rest of the debris in the [[Taris system/Legends|Taris system]] and was perpetually bombarded by [[Meteorite/Legends|meteorites]]. While they waited for their apprentices to return, the Masters waited and [[Meditation/Legends|meditation]] under a [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shield]]. Suddenly, however, the four seers of the First WatchCircle were struck with disturbing visions of the ruin of the Jedi Order and the Republic, linked together by the shared image of a figure in a red [[enviro-suit]], similar to those that their apprentices were wearing on the rogue moon. Taking this to mean that one of their apprentices would unleash destruction upon [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Draay prepared to strike them down with haste. However, Xamar refused to participate unless Krynda was contacted first, and Draay reluctantly agreed to hold off on striking until they received go-ahead from Coruscant to kill their Padawans. However, Draay took one life before leaving the rogue moon, pushing Temple [[LB-series bulk-loading droid|bulk-loader]] droid [[T1-LB]] over a cliff after realizing that the droid had witnessed everything that had occurred.<ref name=\"kotor5\" />\n\nAfter their nightmare on the rogue moon, Draay and the other Masters cloistered in the Jedi Tower for days,<ref name=\"kotor4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 4|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 4]]</ref> in which time they came up with a cover story for the coming murders: the Covenant would tell the word that after Q'Anilia's apprentice [[Shad Jelavan]] was not Knighted due to his headstrong nature, he killed the rest of his classmates before being put down.<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> For his part, Draay contacted Coruscant, hoping to speak to his mother&mdash;instead, he only managed to reach Haazen, who instructed him to return the Padawans to the Draay Estate for evaluation. Draay had no intention of following Haazen's directive,<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> and instead told his comrades that he had received approval from Coruscant to slay their apprentices.<ref name=\"kotor1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 1|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 1]]</ref> When they emerged from their chambers, they proclaimed that they had decided who was to be a Jedi, and set up a banquet and a Knighting ceremony that was to provide the setting for a [[Padawan Massacre|massacre]].<ref name=\"kotor4\" />\n\n===Massacre, manhunt===\n{{Quote|That boy is a ''Jedi'' problem... we're the Jedi solution!|Lucien Draay, to Constable Noana Sowrs|Knights of the Old Republic 3}}\n[[File:Jedi_Covenant_NEGTF.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Draay and the First WatchCircle during the Padawan Massacre of Taris]]\nOn the night of the fateful ceremony, however, a chance occurrence wound up forcing Draay and the Covenant to change gears, and changed everything that was to come. On his way back to the Jedi Tower for the banquet preceding the Knighting, Carrick encountered [[Marn Hierogryph]], a small-time [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]] criminal whom he had unsuccessfully tried several times to apprehend, and after an ill-fated chase arrived at the Tower by crashing through a window through a caterer's table. Draay ordered Carrick to pay for the damage, and while the Padawan haggled with the caterer, he spotted Hierogryph in the streets below and leapt to pursue. Carrick, at long last, finally managed to capture the Snivvian, but in the process made himself late for the ceremony.<ref name=\"kotor1\" /> While the Jedi waited for Carrick's arrival, Jelavan noticed that something was amiss: Draay had his lightsaber, implying that Carrick would be Knighted, despite the fact that he finished last at every test and trial and seemed to have only a dubious grasp of the Force. When the Masters could only respond with halfhearted lies, Jelavan directly challenged them, forcing them to strike before they originally planned.<ref name=\"kotor6\" />\n\n[[File:Jedi_Covenant_Hunt_EGTF.jpg|thumb|250px|Draay and his accomplices confront Carrick]]\nIt was at that moment that Carrick walked in, finding his friends dead at their Masters' feet, and immediately fled from the room.<ref name=\"kotor1\" /> Draay and the other Masters promptly gave chase, taking to the air after Carrick managed to escape the tower with Hierogryph in a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]]. Although Draay's dogged pursuit led him to crash through several [[Viewport/Legends|windows]], Carrick and Hierogryph managed to slip into the [[Lower City]], immediately finding themselves to be the two most wanted fugitives on the planet. Upon returning to the tower, the WatchCircle began to coordinate search efforts with the [[Taris Civil Authority]], and Draay re-established contact with Haazen, explaining that the local authorities were always going to be involved and resolving to make a show of justice&mdash;although Draay did not believe that his apprentice was the dark figure in their vision, he knew that all the bases had to be covered.<ref name=\"kotor2\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]]</ref> Although Jelavan was originally planned to be the scapegoat, Carrick's unlikely escape helped Draay convince the Jedi Order at large that his apprentice had the aid of the dark side, and Carrick was officially charged with the murders.<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> While [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] searched for Carrick, the WatchCircle cloistered in their tower searching for a hint through the Force of where he was headed. Eventually, they caught a glimpse that Carrick and Hierogryph were headed towards the [[rakghoul]]-infested wasteland known as the [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]], and Draay immediately mobilized the group.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nHowever, the Masters found themselves duped by a Hierogryph trick: the Snivvian left a trail heading towards the Undercity and then slipped away again with Carrick as Draay and the other Masters descended into the Undercity itself, fighting hordes of rakghouls and [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]] in a fruitless search. Although Draay was exasperated at having been fooled, he and Taris Security quickly redoubled the search in the Lower City, after receiving word of sightings in [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] camps outside [[Machineville]]. Draay and the WatchCircle met up with [[Constable/Legends|Constable]] [[Noana Sowrs]] and a force of law enforcement&mdash;unaware of the true story behind the massacre, Sowrs agreed to turn Carrick over to the Taris Masters. Following up on their recent leads, Draay and crew tracked Carrick and Hierogryph down in a desolate trash heap known as [[Junk Junction]]. But while they seemed to have the fugitives cornered, Carrick and Hierogryph&mdash;with the help of a pair of [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Arkanian Offshoots]], [[Jarael]] and [[Gorman Vandrayk|Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk]]&mdash;escaped their grasp yet again in a hidden [[578-R space transport|junk hauler]] called [[The Last Resort (starship)|''The Last Resort'']] and took to the skies. Although Sowrs attempted to get Draay and the WatchCircle to return to the Tower and leave Carrick's pursuit to their orbital patrols, but Draay refused, instead directing Sowrs and Taris law enforcement to follow their lead instead.<ref name=\"kotor3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 3|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 3]]</ref>\n\nTheir manhunt next took them to the rogue moon, where Carrick had gone in an attempt to figure out what had happened to precipitate the massacre. Accompanied by a force of Taris police, Draay tracked Carrick and Jarael to the spot where T1-LB's wreckage lay at the foot of the cliff, and finally seemed to have his young charge cornered. However, at the last moment, ''The Last Resort'' reappeared on the scene and destroyed Draay's personnel carrier, stranding them on the rogue moon and allowing Carrick the chance to escape again.<ref name=\"kotor4\" /> But despite the setbacks, the hunt was over in a matter of days, when Carrick, hoping to win the freedom of his comrades, allowed himself to be captured and turned in to face the Covenant by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Valius Ying]]. Ying brought Carrick up to the Council chambers where the murders had been committed, and Draay gave Carrick the true story of how the massacre occurred&mdash;and why, in his opinion, Carrick needed to die next. Believing that the bounty hunter knew too much, Draay slew Ying, intending to use the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek's]] [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to track down Carrick's friends, and moved to strike at his former apprentice. However, fate interceded to rescue Zayne Carrick yet again, as Hierogryph, Vandrayk and Jarael arrived at the critical moment in ''The Last Resort'' to save him from execution and take him away from Taris.<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> The massacre and Carrick's escape undermined public trust in the Jedi Order and law enforcement on Taris, leading to riots and chaos that swept through the lower levels of Tarisian society. Just three weeks after Carrick left Taris, the [[Jedi Enclave]] [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Council]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] pulled all Jedi presence off Taris, threatening to separate Draay from his fellows. Before they left the Jedi Tower behind, however, the Covenanters received a message from Carrick, who vowed to hunt down everyone behind the massacre until one of them confessed and cleared his name.<ref name=\"kotor6\" />\n\n===Covenant adrift===\n{{Quote|There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?

However, Draay was met at the gates of the Draay Estate by 9BD, who refused to allow him in, saying that the Lady Krynda was not taking visitors and telling Draay to wait to be contacted. Shaken by his inability to see his mother, Draay proceeded to the [[Jedi Temple]], where he and the other Masters had been called before the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] to answer for the losses of their students on Taris. Draay admitted a degree of culpability in the massacre&mdash;in the Council's eyes, he had failed to stop Zayne Carrick from committing the murders&mdash;and asked that he and his fellow Masters be allowed to lead the search for the fugitive apprentice. Not fooled, Councilor [[Vrook Lamar]] responded harshly, informing the WatchCircle that they were being reassigned to separate postings. A chastened Draay returned home alone, once again hoping to see his mother. Although Draay could dimly feel her presence within the estate, his attempts to find her were stonewalled by Haazen, who ordered Draay to bring Carrick to him alive before forcing him to leave.<ref name=\"kotor9\" />\n\nDespite the rebukes of the Jedi Council, Draay continued to lead the search for Zayne Carrick from behind the scenes, authorizing an idea of Raana Tey's<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> to draw Carrick out into the open by targeting his father [[Arvan Carrick|Arvan]], a [[Banker/Legends|banker]] based on the planet [[Telerath/Legends|Telerath]]. Although that plan ended up a failure,<ref name=\"kotor12\" /> Draay wound up making his way to Telerath anyway, after receiving word from [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]] of the [[Republic Navy]] that he had apprehended Zayne Carrick and wanted to hand him over. However, Draay arrived on Telerath to find that Karath was presumed dead after his [[Battle Group Serroco|battle group]] was [[Battle of Serroco|decimated]] by the Mandalorians at [[Serroco]], leaving Carrick nowhere to be found and Telerath imminently in the crosshairs of the Mandalorian invasion. Amidst the chaos, Draay made contact with Haazen, who had a new assignment for the Jedi Master. Surmising that Carrick was either dead or in a Mandalorian [[Prison/Legends|prison]], Haazen felt that Draay's talents were best served investigating whispers and visions of a new, growing dark power that was somehow linked to Draay's old childhood acquaintance, Arkoh Adasca.<ref name=\"kotor18\" /> Although Adasca's location was a secret, Draay tracked him down in the remote [[Omonoth system]], at the center of a very dangerous game: Adasca had managed to acquire control of the giant, powerful spacefaring slug-like species known as the [[exogorth]]s, and was attempting to auction off their destructive services to the warring parties in the Mandalorian Wars in a bid to make himself a galactic power. Draay talked his way aboard Adasca's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the ''[[Arkanian Legacy]]'', and met with Adasca to get to the bottom of what was going on&mdash;however, Adasca refused to let anything get in the way of his plans, and incapacitated the Jedi Master with [[Poison/Legends|poisoned]] [[Wine/Legends|wine]] and locked him in the ship's brig.<ref name=\"kotor19\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 19|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 19]]</ref>\n\nWhen Draay awoke, he found himself tied to none other than Zayne Carrick, who had survived the destruction at Serroco along with Admiral Karath, and had been brought aboard the ''Arkanian Legacy'' with Karath's Republic delegation.<ref name=\"kotor19\" /> Surrounded by [[HK-24 series assassin droid|HK-24]] [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droids]] and with no other option but to work together, Draay and Carrick came to an uneasy truce. While still tied up, Draay managed to cause a distraction by throwing a [[Service droid/Legends|serving droid]] into a pair of the HK-24s, prompting a frenzied firefight that allowed Draay and Carrick to escape their bonds and overpower their guards. Draay also recovered his lightsaber from an Adasca guard, and took the opportunity to take a swing at Carrick, who blocked the attack with a pair of [[phrikite]] [[vambrace]]s he had received as a gift from Vandrayk. The Jedi Master knew that then was not the time to strike, so instead, he tossed Carrick a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], promising to sort out their situation once they settled matters with Adasca.<ref name=\"kotor20\" /> The pair then found their way to the ''Arkanian Legacy''{{'s}} observation deck, finding that the situation had escalated exponentially&mdash;the arrival of the final interested party, the Mandalorians, had pushed the auction near the point of violence. They were soon joined by Republic [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Carth Onasi]], a friend of Carrick's, who returned the former apprentice's lightsaber and filled them in on the details of what was going on. It had become clear that Carrick's friend Gorman Vandrayk&mdash;a former Adascorp scientist who had once worked on the exogorths&mdash;was being forced to command the beasts from an off-ship control station against his will, with Adasca holding Jarael as a hostage to get him to comply. Although it seemed a callous option, Draay proposed they simply kill Jarael, thus robbing Adasca of his leverage. That plan was emphatically denied by Mandalorian shock trooper [[Demagol|Rohlan Dyre]], an acquaintance of Carrick's, who had sworn to protect Jarael and threatened Draay with death should he attempt to lay a hand on the [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Arkanian Offshoot]]. Instead, Carrick came up with what seemed to be a winning solution: typical for Draay's old apprentice, he would win with misdirection.<ref name=\"kotor21\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 21|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 21]]</ref>\n\nWearing a new set of armor given to him by Dyre, Carrick posed as a Mandalorian Neo-Crusader trooper and staged a fistfight with Lieutenant Onasi on the auction floor, causing a diversion long enough for Draay, Carrick, and fellow Jedi Knight [[Darth Malak|Alek]]&mdash;at the auction to represent the Jedi Order's pro-war Revanchist faction&mdash;to get the drop on Adasca and destroy his HK-24 guards. Jarael managed to slip away from Adasca in the ensuing firefight between the Mandalorians, the Republic and Adasca's guards, and once Vandrayk received word that she was safe, he responded by ordering the exogorths to attack the ''Arkanian Legacy''. The exogorths ripped the ''Arkanian Legacy'' apart, killing many aboard including Adasca, but Draay came away relatively unscathed. In the wake of the destruction, Draay came upon Carrick and his friends and offered a deal: he would allow all of them safe passage off the wreckage of the ''Arkanian Legacy'' if Carrick turned himself in. Carrick was prepared to take the deal when another ship, the ''[[Moomo Williwaw]]'', arrived by blasting through the side of the listing ''Arkanian Legacy''. The personal [[Gunship/Legends|gunship]] of a notorious pair of [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] bounty hunter [[Moomo Brothers|brothers]], the ''Williwaw'' contained Carrick's [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] friend [[Slyssk]], who spirited Carrick and his compatriots away from the sundered ''Arkanian Legacy'', although not before letting slip that they were headed for Taris. His former apprentice had narrowly eluded him once again, but Draay took solace in the fact that at the very least, he had a lead.<ref name=\"kotor21\" />\n\n===Jedi Councilor===\n{{Quote|I know that no one can&ndash;or should&ndash;evade the will of the ''Jedi Order.'' So it is that I, ''Lucien Draay'', humbly submit to your wishes&ndash;by accepting this seat on the ''Jedi High Council!'' But while being chosen is a great honor&ndash;the true honor belongs to two far greater Jedi. My late father, ''Barrison,'' whose bequest helped us rebuild after the Great Sith War&ndash;and my mother ''Krynda,'' who would have joined this body long ago but for her devotion to training young seers. I will do my best to live up to their examples&ndash;and I begin with an agenda for the future. A future which returns the Jedi Order to its true mission&ndash;preventing the return of the Sith!|Lucien Draay addresses the Jedi High Council|Knights of the Old Republic 29}}\n[[File:LucienCouncil.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lucien Draay takes his seat on the Jedi High Council.]]\nAs it happened, the Covenant already had someone on Taris: Raana Tey, who had been dispatched by the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic to aid [[Taris Resistance|resistance]] efforts against an ongoing Mandalorian [[Taris Siege|siege]] of the planet that had broken out shortly after Jedi presence on the world ended.<ref name=\"kotor23\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 23|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 23]]</ref> However, not too long after, Draay and Q'Anilia sensed Tey's death, her pursuit of Carrick having claimed her life amidst the burning wreckage of the Jedi Tower.<ref name=\"kotor24\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 24|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 24]]</ref> In the wake of their comrade's death, the rest of the First WatchCircle gathered together on the Draay Estate to hold a memorial for Tey, but the ceremony was interrupted by a vision shared between Q'Anilia, Xamar and Feln. Together, the three of them saw galactic destruction wrought by the [[Muur Talisman]], a powerful [[Sith amulet]] believed lost, that held the power to turn people into mindless rakghouls. After researching the Talisman, the group surmised that the artifact had to be somewhere in the rakghoul-infested Undercity of Taris, where Xamar had searched for the amulet in the past. As the members of the WatchCircle were all assigned elsewhere, Draay dispatched one of his Covenant Shadows, [[Celeste Morne]], to track down the Talisman on Taris.<ref name=\"kotor25\" />\n\nBy the time Draay next heard from Morne, the situation had gotten decidedly out of hand. The Mandalorians had reached the Talisman before Morne could, taking the amulet to their staging area at [[Jebble]], where the artifact's corrupting power was threatening to turn an entire army into rampaging rakghouls. What's more, Zayne Carrick was on the scene, having linked up with Morne in the Tarisian Undercity and traveled with her to Jebble. After hearing her report, Draay revised Morne's orders: she was not only to obtain the Talisman and transport it to the Covenant storehouse at the Sanctum of the Exalted, but to kill Zayne Carrick without delay.<ref name=\"kotor27\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 27|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 27]]</ref> However, Morne hesitated to strike after coming to sympathize with Carrick, and the fugitive Padawan escaped Draay's grasp yet again after the Mandalorians [[Battle of Jebble|obliterated]] Jebble to eradicate the rakghoul outbreak.<ref name=\"kotor28\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]]</ref>\n\nNot long after, Draay received a high honor when he was chosen to sit on the Jedi High Council,<ref name=\"kotor29\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 29]]</ref> taking the place of the controversial [[Dorjander Kace]].<ref name=\"kotorwar\">[[Knights of the Old Republic: War 2|''Knights of the Old Republic: War'' 2]]</ref> Draay's rise to the Jedi Council was coordinated behind the scenes by Haazen&mdash;the Draay Trust made several large contributions to the pet charities of a number of Jedi Councilors&mdash;and was only accepted by influential Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar and [[Vandar Tokare]] because it would help them get to the truth of the Padawan Massacre. Tokare, who had been close with Zayne Carrick when the fugitive was a child at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, had long harbored his own doubts about what happened on Taris, and sensed some unseen power structure aiding Draay's advancement. His first motion as a Jedi Councilor was to order the recall of the pro-war Jedi Revanchists, an act that was approved by the rest of the Council.<ref name=\"kotor29\" />\n\nDraay was quickly summoned back to the estate after making his first address to the Council, as the Covenant had received word that Celeste Morne had reported back to the Sanctum on Odryn. Draay sent Feln back to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] to meet with Morne and examine the Muur Talisman, but what the Feeorin found at the Sanctum was entirely different: Zayne Carrick, possessing Morne's key to the Sanctum, carefully cataloguing everything within. Morne and the Talisman were nowhere to be found, and Draay, still wholeheartedly believing that his former apprentice was touched by the dark side, figured that he most likely killed her and took it. The fact that Carrick had made it this far, and had help from so many companions, gave Draay pause, and he ordered Feln to destroy the Sanctum if he thought that Carrick was about to escape or his companions on the ''Moomo Williwaw'' were about to return.<ref name=\"kotor30\" />\n\nHowever, Draay was overruled by Haazen, who had been monitoring the channel and was wholeheartedly against the idea of destroying the collection of Sith artifacts that it had taken so many years to build. Their ensuing argument was cut short when Felt marched off to first take care of Carrick&mdash;a decision that led to disaster. Having challenged Carrick to unarmed combat in accordance with [[Rime Feeorin|Feeorin tradition]], Feln ultimately destroyed the Sanctum after receiving word that the ''Moomo Williwaw'' had been detected at the edge of the [[Odryn system|system]]. Their holy structure a flaming ruin, the Feeorin people turned on and butchered Feln, reducing the number of Padawan killers to three.<ref name=\"kotor30\" />\n\nAfter sensing his friend's death, Draay moved quickly. Surmising that Carrick would return to Coruscant with proof of the Sanctum storehouse and attempt to expose the Covenant, Draay contacted Admiral Karath and informed him that Carrick and his friends were en route to Coruscant to raid the planet for the Mandalorians in the ''Moomo Williwaw''. Karath immediately formed up the entire Republic Navy to protect Coruscant and apprehend Carrick, and after making several threats to coax Xamar into compliance, Draay dispatched the [[Khil]] to Karath's ship to ensure Carrick did not elude him once again.<ref name=\"kotor30\" />\n\n===Vindication and the True Covenant===\n{{Quote|I already have the Jedi followers I require. Lucien&ndash;the one for the darkness&ndash;''you'' will train my Sith.|Haazen|Knights of the Old Republic 34}}\n[[File:Lucienandzayne.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Lucien Draay and Zayne Carrick clash during Vindication.]]\nEven so, Carrick and Marn Hierogryph managed to slip past the blockade and reach Coruscant, but was swiftly apprehended by Xamar after landing on the Republic capital. However, Xamar had had a change of heart regarding the Covenant, and agreed to confess in exchange for full immunity for Krynda and and a role in her rescue from the Draay Estate, from which she had silent for some time. Xamar's plan was to attempt to bring Carrick in front of Krynda, believing it was the only way to coax the Master from her chambers, and when Xamar brought Carrick in front of Draay he looked the picture of a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] with a replica Muur Talisman around his neck. To Draay, it appeared that the justice he had long awaited was at hand, but when he ignited his lightsaber to at last slay his former apprentice, Xamar intervened and demanded that Krynda be called to inspect Carrick. Instead, Haazen emerged, saying that Krynda could not be disturbed, and for once Draay agreed with him&mdash;he refused to let Carrick, whom he still believed to be the ruin of the Jedi Order, anywhere near his mother.<ref name=\"kotor32\" />\n\nUnlike Draay, Haazen wasn't fooled by Carrick's false amulet or his Sith costume, and exposed Carrick's trick for all to see. However, by that point, Xamar had slipped away to signal the rest of the Jedi Order to raid the Draay Estate. But instead of reacting with panic, Haazen signaled a codeword known to Draay: [[Vindication]]. \"Vindication\" was a contingency plan that essentially amounted to a Covenant insurrection within the Jedi Order, only previously discussed in case the Sith infiltrated the Jedi Council and threatened to take control of the artifacts the Covenant had spent years collecting. For Haazen, it was a culmination of years of planning, as he revealed that he had been carefully manipulating Draay for years in order to reach this point&mdash;according to Haazen, everything that Draay had done or wanted in his life had first been planted there by him, using him as a tool to push the Covenant to a point where he could assume control. And to deal with the little matter of the Order laying siege to the Draay Estate, Haazen revealed that he had [[Vanjervalis Chain|taken control]] of the Republic warships that had been attempting to prevent Carrick from reaching Coruscant, ordering them to bomb the areas surrounding the estate and killing a number of Jedi, including Xamar.<ref name=\"kotor32\" />\n\nDraay moved to attack Haazen and end the madness, only to find himself swiftly repelled by an artifact Haazen had taken straight out of the Covenant's archives. The [[Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger]], worn on Haazen's arm, prevented anyone from touching him without his consent, and protected him entirely from Draay's efforts to stop him. It was then that Haazen revealed his final plan. Having already accrued many Jedi followers from his work with the Covenant, he would then create a new generation of Sith, creating dual armies that he would command alone, both and neither, standing apart. And to train his Sith, he chose Lucien Draay, whom he had pushed to gather artifacts and search for Sith resources as preparation for his new role as a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]].<ref name=\"kotor34\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 34|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 34]]</ref>\n\nAlthough Draay protested that it was not something he wanted, he still accepted Haazen's lightsaber, red-bladed, much like those used by the Sith. He would soon put that new lightsaber to use to stop Carrick from trying to follow Q'Anilia back to the Lady Krynda, still dead-set on never letting his former Padawan near his mother in the case that the prophecy was still correct. Draay chased Carrick through the compound, intent on slaying him then and there, but their showdown was stopped by the sudden arrival of Krynda, accompanied by Marn Hierogryph. Hierogryph had tailed Q'Anilia back to Krynda's room and found her incapacitated, and while Q'Anilia thought her Master was dead&mdash;and had in turn committed [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] in order to be with her again&mdash;Hierogryph recognized her \"casket\" as a life-preserving oubliette and had woken her up. In her weakened state, Krynda revealed that after Lucien called in his report of the rogue moon vision, she had a vision of her own, depicting the Masters of the First WatchCircle slaying their Padawans. This traumatic sight caused her to suffer a stroke, and as her death was not in his plan, Haazen moved quickly to put her in the oubliette. Krynda begged her son to tell her that he did follow through with the massacre, but Lucien reluctantly divulged that while he had not personally shed blood, he he had ordered the killings. Shattered by her son's admission, Krynda died in Lucien's arms, her last words telling him to face the future with humility. As Hierogryph was the one to take Krynda out of stasis, Lucien blamed the Snivvian for his mother's death, and erupted into a rage.<ref name=\"kotor34\" />\n\nBy now teetering on the brink of the dark side, Draay leapt to attack but was met instead by Carrick, who was committed to doing all he could to allow his friend a chance to escape. Although the two dueled briefly, Carrick was able to talk Draay down, and together the two came up with a plan to stop Haazen. They decided to stage a cinematic chase and fight, with Draay pursuing Hierogryph into the ruins of estate courtyard and having a dramatic duel in front of Haazen. In the heat of battle, Draay toppled the statue of his father that stood nearby, which collapsed on top of him. His former master buried under the rubble, Carrick drew his lightsaber and \"slew\" Draay, impressing Haazen, who allowed him to approach and commanded the Kressh gauntlet to allow him to touch him. The instant Haazen let his guard down, Carrick struck, slicing off the [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] arm that carried not only the gauntlet, but the control panel for the Republic ships still under Haazen's control. It was now time for Draay to do his part. Rising from beneath the wreckage of the statue bloodied but still alive, Draay used the Force to [[Telekinesis/Legends|slingshot]] Carrick and Hierogryph far out of harm's way, and then picked up Haazen's severed arm and ordered the Republic ships overhead to fire on Haazen's position. The ensuing barrage completely obliterated the Draay Estate, ended the threat of Haazen, and killed the last of the Draay family&mdash;at least, it was publicly believed.<ref name=\"kotor35\" />\n[[File:Blind_Lucien.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Draay in his self exile as head of his [[True Covenant]].|left]]\nWhile Lucien Draay was dead to the galaxy, the events of Vindication covered up as a Mandalorian terrorist attack by the authorities, Draay emerged from the devastation blinded but very much alive, thanks to the fact that he was holding the Kressh gauntlet at the time of the barrage. Although the months to come held much pain, Draay emerged in the light, having realized his true mission. Years before, Draay had secretly bought a [[Draay 2|private moon]]<ref name=\"kotor35\" /> on the Outer Rim<ref name=\"lost temple\">''[[The Clone Wars: Defenders of the Lost Temple]]''</ref> as a hidden sanctum in case he ever needed to reconstitute the Jedi Covenant in a time of crisis. It was there he retreated to dedicate his second life, to leading a [[True Covenant|new Covenant]], one with strong philosophical differences from the original Covenant. This new \"True Covenant\" would keep watch for the future, but instead of trying to avert a prophesied doom, would focus on keeping the Jedi ways alive. And although he could no longer physically see, Draay believed that at long last he could finally see his future.<ref name=\"kotor35\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nDraay's True Covenant grew to encompass a number of Jedi<ref name=\"kotor35\" /> and built a hidden [[Jedi Temple (Draay 2)|temple]] carved into the side of a massive cliff, a complex that held, among other things, the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger. The Jedi presence on Draay's moon was gone by the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] several thousand years later, but the temple still stood, and in [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]] the complex was rediscovered by Jedi Master [[B'ink Utrila]] and a squad of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], who were searching for the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger. Within they found a number of carvings depicting Draay and the events of Vindication, as well as a [[Stone guardian/Legends|powerful guard droid]] sculpted in the image of Draay holding the Kressh gauntlet. The temple was destroyed soon after in a skirmish between Utrila's forces and a gang of Mandalorian [[Death Watch]] warriors, and one [[Glitch|trooper]] survived to cast the Kressh gauntlet into a nearby river.<ref name=\"lost temple\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|We all go where the Force takes us&ndash;wherever that may lead.

Instead, Draay developed a love-hate surrogate parental relationship with family retainer Haazen,<ref name=\"kotorcg\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> although Draay openly scorned him as a failed Jedi prospect.<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> Although Draay outwardly held Haazen in little regard and often went against Haazen's orders,<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> Draay still unwittingly allowed himself to be manipulated by his father's former friend for most of his life.<ref name=\"kotor34\" /> Draay found no solace in his social circle, either. While his elite family name gave him access to a similarly elite group of friends, he found them to be self-involved and tiresome, especially his old friend Arkoh Adasca.<ref name=\"kotor18\" />\n\nDraay grew up extremely frustrated by his mother's lack of attention, and was deeply unsatisfied by his Jedi training, as he was left to Haazen instead of learning with his mother's seers as he desired. Although he never knew his father, Lucien held Barrison Draay in high esteem,<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> and continued to do so throughout his life, feeling that when he took his seat on the Jedi High Council that his father should have been there instead of him.<ref name=\"kotor31\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]</ref> Most of all, Lucien admired his father's prowess as a warrior, and followed strongly in Barrison's footsteps.<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> And despite his mother's scorn, after being brought into the fold of the Jedi Covenant, Draay became completely devoted not only to her, but to the Covenant's mission.<ref name=\"kotor32\" /> As a teacher, Draay was remote and unhelpful to his charge Zayne Carrick, but found his Padawan's bumbling convenient, as it allowed him to write him off as a lost cause and focus all his energy on the Covenant.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> Privately, Draay admitted that he found Carrick's travails entertaining.<ref name=\"kotor1\" />\n\nCommitted to never letting personal bonds get in the way of his work, Draay had little use for friends.<ref name=\"kotor20\" /> However, Draay had his own close, pseudo-romantic relationship with fellow Covenanter Q'Anilia that stretched over many years,<ref name=\"kotor32\" /> and also had a friendship of sorts with Feln, who made it a personal quest to get Draay to crack a smile.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> Draay had a rockier relationship with Xamar, as the Khil's cautious nature, characteristic of his species, led the two to clash often.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> After his Padawan's escape, Draay was initially doubtful that Carrick was the dark figure glimpsed in the rogue moon prophecy,<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> but subsequent events drove Draay to believe wholeheartedly that Carrick had fallen to the dark side.<ref name=\"kotor30\" /> This conviction, his deep and abiding hatred of the Sith,<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> and his commitment to the survival of the Jedi ways that was at the core of the Jedi Covenant's mission, drove Draay to become absolutely obsessed with hunting Carrick down.<ref name=\"kotorcg\" />\n\nIt was in the affair surrounding the Padawan Massacre that Draay's ruthless side came out. A brutally pragmatic man, Draay was immediately willing to kill the apprentices after the vision on the rogue moon,<ref name=\"kotor5\" /> and had no qualms with killing innocent people along the way.<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> To Draay, the mission was all, and no deed&mdash;lying to the Jedi High Council,<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> theft, or cold-blooded murder<ref name=\"kotor6\" />&mdash;was off-limits if it served the ultimate goal of the Jedi Covenant.<ref name=\"kotor5\" /> And although he was repeatedly commanded to either disengage from the manhunt for Carrick or bring him in alive, Draay became so convinced that killing Carrick was the only way to save the galaxy from ruin that he refused to accept any other option.<ref name=\"kotor9\" /> Haazen's treachery, the revelation of how the family retainer had manipulated Draay throughout his life, and his mother's death drove him near-mad with grief and to the brink of the dark side, causing Draay to lash out in rage<ref name=\"kotor34\" /> and drowning his soul in betrayal and fury. However, Draay's memory of his father helped him reject the Sith destiny Haazen had planned for him, and let go of his hatred of Carrick to work together with him to foil Haazen's plans. Despite the losses he suffered, Draay emerged on the other side with a sense of inner clarity that had eluded him for his entire life, moving him to honor his father's memory by starting a True Covenant to honor his father's belief in choosing one's own way.<ref name=\"kotor35\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Lucien is every bit the fighter his father was.|Haazen|Knights of the Old Republic 9}}\n[[File:ShiiChoDisarmingSlashKOTORHomecoming.jpg|thumb|left|Lucien Draay showcasing his talent with a lightsaber at the Draay Estate.]]\nAlthough Draay had Miraluka blood through his mother, Draay was born with only physical sight like his full-blooded Human father, and without the [[Force sight]] of his mother.
