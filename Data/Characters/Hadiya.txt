When she was challenged by the [[Je'daii Order]] in [[25,805 BBY]], Hadiya led the [[Despot Army]] to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] to begin the [[Despot War]]. The Despot Queen slew many Je'daii in battle on Tython, though her [[Death/Legends|death]] at the hands of the Je'daii [[Daegen Lok]] at the Je'daii temple of [[Kaleth]] brought the Despot War to an end.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|In her pride, she would not be subject to the Je'daii&mdash;or the \"will\" of the Force.

Agreeing to have Lok by her side, Hadiya was impressed by his ruthlessness and quickly promoted him to [[General/Legends|general]] within her army.<ref name=\"DOTJ 9\" /> \n\n[[File:Hadiya-Lok-DotJ10.png|thumb|Queen Hadiya, moment before her assassination by Daegen Lok.]]\nLaunching her attack on the Je'daii Temple of [[Kaleth]] with Lok by her side,<ref name=\"DOTJ 9\" /> Hadiya fought on the front lines, killing the [[Shae Koda's mother|mother]] and [[Shae Koda's father|father]] of [[Shae Koda]] at the gates of the Temple.<ref name=\"DOTJ 4\" /> Despite her superior numbers, Hadiya's armies were ultimately outmatched by the Je'daii but were still willing to fight to the death. By the time they had reached Kaleth, Hadiya had taken Lok as her lover and allowed him to sleep in her tent beside her during the evenings. Late in the battle, Lok caught Hadiya asleep one evening and drew a small dagger. While Lok hesitated, Hadiya awoke and attacked her assailant, slashing at his right eye and scarring his brow before he grabbed her with the Force and killed her.
