He was present in [[3956 BBY]] when [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] imposed a planet-wide quarantine on the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]]. He frequented [[Javyar's Cantina]] in the [[Lower City]], and would sell [[Pazaak/Legends|Pazaak]] cards there.\n\n==Biography==\nUriah was born on the [[City/Legends|urban]] [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]]<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|220|Taris}}</ref><ref name=\"EAOC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] and lived during the [[Old Sith Wars]].<ref name=\"kotor\" /> The rich [[Human/Legends|human]] population of Taris was very [[Humanocentrism|humanocentric]] and [[Speciesism|discriminatory]] of the poor and beings of other [[Species/Legends|species]],<ref name=\"kotor\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and as such, Uriah was forced to live in poor conditions in the [[Lower City]]. He spent much of his [[Time/Legends|time]] at [[Javyar's Cantina]] in the Lower City. He sold cards for [[Pazaak/Legends|Pazaak]], a [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] card game played by many [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]] at the time.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n===The Jedi Civil War===\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name= \"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> the [[Hammerhead-class cruiser]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'', belonging to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], was [[Attack on the Endar Spire|ambushed]] by [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] and destroyed. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Bastila Shan]], who was on board, was unable to use her [[Battle meditation]], due to the sudden attack. Shan, along with several soldiers, including [[Carth Onasi]] and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], jettisoned in the [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]], crashing to the planet below. In response to this, the Sith imposed a planet-wide quarantine of the planet, hoping to trap and locate Shan.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nWhile Shan crashed into the planet's [[Undercity (Taris)|undercity]], Revan and Onasi instead crashed into the [[Upper City]], and decided to look for Shan. Uriah was present in Javyar's [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] when Revan visited, searching for information of Shan. He was approached by Revan, who asked questions about the Lower City and the crashed escape pods in the Undercity. While he was willing to impart his limited knowledge of most subjects, he refused to talk about the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Davik Kang]], as [[Zax]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], who worked for Kang, was in the nearby [[Zax's bounty office|bounty office]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nUriah was still present on Taris during its [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombardment]] and [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] by the Sith [[Fleet/Legends|Fleet]], after Malak was unable to find Bastila Shan.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Personality and Traits==\nUriah was a [[Gender|male]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] with [[Color/Legends|green]] skin and gray [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. He wore his [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]] around his neck, like many other males of his species. While in the cantina, he wore a brown tunic and orange pants. He believed the streets were safer when the [[Hidden Beks]] [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gang]] was in charge, and disliked the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]]. He thought [[Brejik]] to be ruthless, and even a little insane. He was wary not to talk poorly of Davik Kang near any of his associates. He could understand [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|basic]], but spoke in [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nUriah appeared as a non-player character in the<ref name=\"kotor\" /> [[2003]]<ref name=\"KOTOR Date\">{{SW|url=news/kotor-galaxy-of-heroes|text=BioWare and Capital Games on Bringing ''KotOR'' Fan Favorites into ''Galaxy of Heroes''}}</ref> [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]].''
