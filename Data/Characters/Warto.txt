Originally a laborer on a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]], his behavior and temper addled his crewmembers. In turn, he was abandoned by his crew on [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]], where he was forced to eke out a new existence lifting crates and strong-boxes at the local [[Spaceport/Legends|starport]], while also mugging several of the weaker locals. He came to spend most of his free time at [[Locru's Central Saloon]], consuming large amounts of strong [[nikta]].\n\nOne evening, Warto wrongfully convinced himself that the [[Wroonian]] [[Azoora]] was in fact his girlfriend, and was enraged when he saw a Corellian pilot, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], attempting to woo her. A brawl broke out, and Warto was subdued by Solo's first mate, the hulking [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. Scorned, Warto later sought to join a posse being formulated in [[Tun Aduban]] in order to earn enough money to buy his way offworld, but his enrollment was prevented by the aggravated [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]], [[Jaxxon]]. When Warto learned that the posse was being assembled by Solo, he aligned himself with Serji-X Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders, who had been terrorizing a local village. The Boltrunian tipped Arrogantus off to the formation of Solo's posse, and later joined the Cloud-Riders in raiding the village of [[Onacra]]. During the battle with Solo's posse, Warto was pulverized to death by Chewbacca.\n\n==Biography==\n===A Boltrunian scorned===\n{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Azoora is ''mine'', see&mdash;and you'd better ''keep away'' from her!|Warto|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\n[[File:WartoGrabsHan-MSW8.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A jealous Warto grabs Han Solo from behind]]\nWarto was a green-skinned [[Boltrunian/Legends|Boltrunian]], who found work as a laborer on a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] during the [[Imperial Period]]. His foul temper earned him no friends, and his fellow crewmen decided to abandon him on the remote [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]]. As a result, Warto developed a grudge against all Corellians. He managed to make a rather meager living preying on weaker individuals, mugging them. He also found work as a [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] [[crater-buster]], where he hauled strong-boxes for those who were unable to hire the services of a binary [[load lifter]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nWarto came to spend most of his time at [[Locru's Central Saloon]] in [[Tun Aduban]], as he had a particular liking for strong [[nikta]]. One evening in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Warto convinced himself that the alluring and flirtatious [[Wroonian]], [[Azoora]], was actually his girlfriend. He was enraged when a Corellian [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], appeared to be seducing her,<ref name=\"g4\" /> and grabbed him. Warto threatened the Corellian, warning him not to go near Azoora again. Solo played the innocent, and warned the Boltrunian to depart before his [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], arrived. Warto scoffed at the threat, and Solo responded by smashing a chair against the Boltrunian's face. Enraged, Warto picked up the Corellian, and hurled him across the bar. A brawl broke out, before Chewbacca arrived. Undeterred, Warto struck the Wookiee several times, but Chewbacca appeared to be unaffected by the strikes.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Warto was subsequently hurled through a plate-glass window.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n===Star-Hoppers and Cloud-Riders===\n{{Quote|All right, then, if these space-rats are so anxious to ''die''&mdash;let's ''give them'' what they ''want!''|Warto|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nWhen word spread around town that a posse was being formulated for an unspecified reason, Warto attempted to sign up. He saw it as an opportunity to finally get off Aduba-3 by raising enough [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to buy passage offworld. The man organizing the posse was interviewing candidates at [[Locru]]'s inn, and a queue had formed. As the [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] [[Jaxxon]] prepared to enter the interview, Warto cut in front of him. The Lepi protested, and Warto responded by striking him. Incensed, Jaxxon sent the Boltrunian reeling with a punitive kick,<ref name=\"m8\" /> preventing him from joining the posse. Warto later discovered that the posse was being assembled by Solo himself, in order to defend innocent farmers of [[Onacra]] village being terrorized by [[Serji-X Arrogantus]] and his [[Cloud-Rider/Legends|Cloud-Riders]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nWarto elected to join Arrogantus instead, alerting him to Solo's activities.<ref name=\"sxadb\">{{DB|character|serjixarrogantus|Arrogantus, Serji-X|archivedate=20100203120524}}</ref> Arrogantus was impressed with the Boltrunian's strength and rage, and granted him the use of a [[skyspeeder]] that formerly belonged to someone who had fallen prey to a [[high-hound]].<ref name=\"g4\" /> Warto informed Arrogantus about Solo's actions, and the Cloud-Riders rode back to Tun Aduban, where they met the newly assembled posse, the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]]. When Solo noticed that Warto had joined the Cloud-Riders, the Boltrunian goaded him, but Arrogantus ordered Warto not to fire until word was given. Arrogantus and Solo bandied words before the Cloud-Riders rode off, in preparation for their fresh attack against Onacra.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\nWarto later joined Arrogantus in an attack on Onacra.<ref name=\"g4\" /> Noticing that the Star-Hoppers had not heeded Arrogantus' earlier warning, Warto resolved to give the defenders no quarter. However, his skyspeeder was grabbed by the telescoping arms of one defender, [[FE-9Q]], and was brought to a halt. Warto was dismounted by Chewbacca, who then killed the Boltrunian with his bare hands.<ref name=\"m9\">[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]</ref><ref name=\"g4\" /> Warto was later profiled by [[Historian/Legends|historian]] [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], who later added the details of his biography to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] database, [[Mistress Mnemos]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What's ''wrong'' with you, Wookiee? Don't ya know enough ta lay down an' ''play dead'' when I ''hit'' ya?|Warto|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\n[[File:Warto.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Warto]]\nWarto possessed a particularly short temper, and was not overly intelligent. His demeanor was enough to inspire his fellow crewmen to abandon him on the desolate world of Aduba-3. In order to eke out an existence, Warto elected to prey on those that did not possess his level of strength. The Boltrunian was also a drinker, and was able to convince himself that Azoora was his girlfriend&mdash;so complete was his self-deception that he became highly aggressive when a smuggler, and a Corellian no less, approached her. Warto was also impatient, cutting through the queue to enlist in Solo's posse.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nHis chief desire was to get off Aduba-3, and ultimately that drove most of his actions. He was driven by vengeance, which was ultimately what led Serji-X Arrogantus to hire his services.<ref name=\"g4\" /> The Boltrunian came to hate Solo and was more than willing to gun the Corellian down, but was forced to obey his new master instead. Warto also held a sense of derision for the Lepi, Jaxxon, labeling him a \"[[Rodent/Legends|rodent]]\" and evoking a great deal of aggression from the spacer. Although he found Solo to be a fairly unchallenging physical combatant, Warto was outmatched by the Wookiee Chewbacca, whose strength the Boltrunian had originally dismissed with derision.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Amongst Warto's skills was the ability to speak, read, and write [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]]. He also wielded a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWarto was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Howard Chaykin]] and [[Tom Palmer]] for [[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] ([[1978]]). The character was killed off in the next issue, [[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]] (1978). He later received a write-up in ''[[The Starhoppers of Aduba-3]]'', published in ''[[Star Wars Gamer 4]]'' ([[2001]]).\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|serjixarrogantus|Arrogantus, Serji-X|archivedate=20100203120524}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Warto\n}}\n\n[[Category:Adubans]]\n[[Category:Boltrunians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
