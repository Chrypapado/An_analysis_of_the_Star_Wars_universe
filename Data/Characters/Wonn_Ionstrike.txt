He employed a [[Houk/Legends|Houk]] strongbeing named [[Morg Nar]]. After an accident which left him paralyzed, Ionstrike spent his time laboring even from his specially-designed [[Power chair|hoverchair]] to remove [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] influence from the floating metropolis.\n\n==Biography==\nWonn Ionstrike was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] around [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]]. He began his career as a [[Gambler/Legends|gambler]], making numerous underworld connections before moving into [[Computer/Legends|computer]] [[Forger (occupation)|forgery]]. Ionstrike then moved to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], where he became one of the most powerful [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lords]] in all of [[Port Town (Cloud City)/Legends|Port Town]], organizing an elite band of criminals including [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]], [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], [[Slicer/Legends|slicers]], [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] into the [[Lenushaa gang]]. The gang had sixty-three members, along with two stock [[Light freighter/Legends|light freighters]], the ''[[Iviitz]]'' and the ''[[Bountiful Hunter]]'', and operated out of Cloud City and along the [[Corellian Trade Spine/Legends|Corellian Trade Spine]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nIonstrike performed several illegal experiments in implanting himself with [[biocomp implant]]s in order to assist his computer forgery work. However, the experiments failed, and destroyed several major neural groupings in his spine. The result left him crippled, and requiring an [[exoskeleton]] attached to his upper body to assist with eating, drinking, reading, and object manipulation. He was also confined to a [[Power chair|hoverchair]]. As a result, four large mercenaries attended him as [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nIonstrike operated out of a partially empty level between Port Town and the [[Tibanna/Legends|Tibanna]] gas storage levels, and his main objective was to drive [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] out of business.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWonn Ionstrike stood 1.4 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]], with a thin face and [[Color/Legends|silver]] hair that gave him a graceful air. He was cold and calculating, and ran his criminal enterprise like a game of [[Chess/Legends|chess]]. Due to his accident, Ionstrike's body was confined to a specialized hoverchair, as his body was crippled and withered due to the destruction of nerve groups along his spine. The nerve damage affected Ionstrike's speech; he could only speak out of the right side of his mouth. Although his speech was slurred, the slow and deliberate way he spoke gave him an elegant and commanding tone. Ionstrike's smile was also grim.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nIonstrike was skilled in the use of a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], as well as in [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] procedure. As a crime lord, he had an intimidating and commanding presence, and was a skilled forger. Ionstrike could program and repair computers, and bypass security systems. He was also an proficient gambler.<ref name=\"GG2-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nIonstrike was confined to a hoverchair, which had a blaster mounted on it.
