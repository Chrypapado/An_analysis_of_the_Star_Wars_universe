She was tall for a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] and had a very businesslike demeanor. Renna was known to offer a job on the spot to people who impressed her.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Renna's Service had several shipments hijacked by [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]], as did many of the local trading concerns. Renna started to have issues with her security forces due to this. When one particularly brazen theft occurred in her own compound by thieves wearing her (stolen) security uniforms, one of the pirates, [[Lars]], was captured by a group of strangers. Renna was so impressed with them over her own security forces, she offered them jobs. Those strangers ended up bringing down the pirates and recovering some of the stolen goods.<ref name=\"ACP\">''[[A Cularin Presence]]''</ref>\n\nRenna capitalized on the troubles the [[Metatheran Cartel]] experienced a few months later, as the group she had hired proved instrumental in revealing [[Velin Wir]]'s rogue activities.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Renna was involved in a news investigation soon afterward due to the rapid growth of her business. Renna's Transport Service had grown by 500 percent in a period in which no other local transport concern grew more than 100 percent, which some found suspicious. Although rumors related Renna with [[Nirama]]'s [[Organization|criminal organization]], there were no proofs linking the Service to any smuggling activity.<ref name=\"RTS\">''[[Renna's Transport Service (article)]]''</ref>\n\nRenna had a relationship with a part-time [[Transport/Legends|transport]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who worked for her, [[Teeloo]]. Teeloo was killed by [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] men because he worked for [[Nirama]], leaving Renna heart-broken. Even after his death, Renna continued the transport service.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRenna is incorrectly featured in the last page of [[RPGA]] adventure ''[[A Revelation]]'': In the critical event summary, the RPGA asks for statistical purposes whether the player characters rescue Renna or not - but Renna is not mentioned in the adventure; the name in the question should have been [[Gerta Haman]], who is susceptible of being rescued.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Oblivion's Kiss]]''\n*''[[Quarters]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[An Official Engagement]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Philosophy]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Outward Bound (Living Force adventure)|''Outward Bound'']]\n*[[Contract AA23 (roleplaying adventure)|''Contract AA23'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Storm's Depths]]''\n*''[[A Plague of Darkness]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060223Cradle|text=Living Force: From the Cradle to the Grave|int=Living Force: From the Cradle to the Grave|archivedate=20091016005600}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20020829renna|text=Renna's Transport Service|int=Renna's Transport Service (article)|archivedate=20091016031402}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
