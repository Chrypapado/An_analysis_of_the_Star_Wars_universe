Prior to [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Raynor took control of [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]], and embezzled millions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the station to support [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operations on various [[Planet/Legends|planets]]. The Wheel's immense popularity allowed it to survive the loss of credits, and Raynor eventually assumed full control of the station when he was able to buy out the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]], which had suspected but could never prove his embezzlement. However, as a result of his success, Raynor found himself the victim of a lawsuit from former business associate [[Iaco Stark]], who had purchased a similar space station called the [[Jubilee Wheel (space station)|Jubilee Wheel]], and stated mostly unfounded claims of copyright. Raynor in turn went on the offensive with official proof that the Wheel was officially registered as the \"Marvelous Wheel,\" seeking damages for the pain and duress caused by Stark's lawsuit. However, when Stark's [[Lawyer/Legends|attorney]] was the celebrity [[Qimberly Gaitag-Delio]], also a granddaughter of the Wheel's founder, [[Doffen Gaitag]], Raynor realized he could not win the lawsuit, and sold control of the Wheel to [[Cody Sunn-Childe]].\n\nRaynor eventually became the [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]] until [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]]. Though adept at corporate matters, Raynor was a corrupt and despotic leader who ruled his [[City/Legends|city]] ineptly, bringing its status down in the eyes of many, and turning the [[Bespin Wing Guard/Legends|Bespin Wing Guard]] into a breeding ground of corruption. Raynor enjoyed a number of pastimes, chief amongst them [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]], and also his lover [[Ymile]]. In 1 ABY, a gambler named [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] attracted Raynor's eye as an opponent in [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]], and the Baron Administrator challenged him to a game. Their first match cost Calrissian his money and [[Cobra|ship]]. Even the revelation that Calrissian's nemesis [[Barpotomous Drebble/Legends|Barpotomous Drebble]] had cheated on Raynor's behalf, though angering the Baron Administrator, did not get Calrissian his money back.\n\nCalrissian soon got an anonymous donation by way of Raynor's aide [[Lobot/Legends|Lobot]], secretly from a group of fifty thousand workers who wanted Raynor gone. The second match went into high stakes again, and Calrissian laid out his [[Starship/Legends|starship]] lot against Raynor's position as Baron Administrator. Raynor accepted, and Calrissian won the match and city. Raynor left with Ymile, but he was not through with Calrissian. The former administrator attempted to get revenge on the man who had taken his job multiple times, sending a number of [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] and [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] after Calrissian with no success.\n\n==Biography==\n===Businessman===\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]]<ref name=\"LL\" /> Dominic Raynor [[Tionese (people)|hailed]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tion]]. He was a business mogul and owner of [[Raynor Mining Enterprises]]. Due to his ethically questionable business practices, he was widely known as a [[Gangster/Legends|gangster]]. Before [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Raynor had used his business acumen to take control of [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] from its previous [[Administrator/Legends|administrator]] [[Kelek]] the Blue, a [[Tefaun]] banker. Kelek, who owed money to the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]], sold the majority of her shares to Raynor to settle her debt. As the new administrator, Raynor embezzled millions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the station, using the funds to support [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operations on the planets of [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], [[Ota]], and other worlds. The Banking Clan suspected Raynor of skimming profits, but they were unable to prove it. As his predecessor had done, Raynor expanded the facilities on the Wheel, doubling the number of [[Casino/Legends|casinos]] and bringing the station's popularity and wealth to an all time high. Although his abilities as administrator helped bring the space station notoriety, it also burdened it with a seedy reputation. Many of the casinos were rigged in Raynor's favor, and rumors of corruption plagued the station. However, the station continued to make a profit, and Raynor was able to buy out the shares of the Banking Clan, assuming direct control of the station.<ref name=\"Vegas\" />\n\nDue to his success, Raynor found himself the victim of a lawsuit from a former business associate, [[Iaco Stark]]. Stark was angry with Raynor due to a previous incident they had experienced together in the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]]. The incident, never fully explained, had involved [[Zanibar]] cannibals, a [[Sith amulet]], and the disappearance of Stark's girlfriend, the [[Hologram/Legends|holo]]-starlet [[Riva Denais]]. To get back at Raynor, Stark had purchased a similar space station, the [[Jubilee Wheel (space station)|Jubilee Wheel]], in the [[Bright Jewel Cluster]] and claimed that the Wheel was infringing on his station's copyright. Stark claimed that Raynor's station had stolen the Jubilee's design and its use of the word \"wheel,\" and that Raynor was running a game called \"[[Jubilee Wheel (game)|Jubilee Wheel]]\" on his station. Although the majority of Stark's claims were frivolous and unfounded, Raynor went on the offensive. He was able to procure proof that his station was officially registered as the \"Marvelous Wheel\" and countersued Stark for the emotional duress, pain, and suffering caused by Stark's lawsuit. However, in the following legal proceedings, Stark was represented by the celebrity [[Lawyer/Legends|attorney]] [[Qimberly Gaitag-Delio]], who was also a granddaughter of the Wheel's founder, [[Doffen Gaitag]]. Realizing that he was fighting a losing battle, Raynor sold the Wheel to the [[Jashwik]] [[Cody Sunn-Childe]].<ref name=\"Vegas\" />\n\n===Baron Administrator===\nRaynor eventually took the office of [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], the floating [[City/Legends|city]] of Bespin, traditionally passed down by decree of the previous administrator.<ref name=\"GG2\">''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]''</ref> Though well-skilled in corporate issues,<ref name=\"GNN\">{{Journal|14|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> as the leader of his city, Raynor proved to be a venal despot<ref name=\"GG3\">''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref> and inept at his job. Cloud City earned a reputation of infamy throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]],<ref name=\"EGTC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> and the opinion arose that it had declined under Raynor's watch. Thousands of workers in the city and gas mines were opposed to Raynor's methods and how they had affected the city.<ref name=\"LL\" /> Corruption seeped into [[Bespin Wing Guard/Legends|Bespin's Wing Guard]] under his rule as well, turning the unit into a disorganized band run by thieves and bureaucrats, only providing protection to those who could pay.<ref name=\"GG3\" /> Raynor's law was draconian, and a thriving black market trade in [[Droid/Legends|droids]] sprang up under his administration.<ref name=\"GG2\" /> Though officials of Cloud City were legally barred from [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]], Raynor was fond of the pastime and continued to do it anyway. He took on a lover, the Human woman [[Ymile]], though she was not fond of living on Bespin and wanted to travel.<ref name=\"LL\" /> The [[Exex]] and [[Parliament of Guilds]]&mdash;the other two branches of Bespinite government&mdash;wanted Raynor out. Rather than use slow political means or more criminal methods of removal, they decided to set him up to fall.<ref name=\"GNN\" />\n\n===A sabacc match===\n{{Quote|Here's the title for the Cobra.''\"<br />\"''And here's an Idiot's Array!|Raynor strikes a seemingly fatal blow in his game with Calrissian|Lady Luck (comic)}}\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Raynor took an interest in a visiting gambler to Cloud City, [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]]. Calrissian was enjoying a winning streak, and Raynor sent his aide [[Lobot/Legends|Lobot]] to him with an offer to play against Raynor in the [[Ecclessis Figg Room]]<ref name=\"LL\" /> of the [[Trest]] casino.<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> With Ymile joining them at the table, they began their high-stakes game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] with a large audience in attendance. The bet quickly increased; when it reached two million credits, Calrissian ran out of money and had to put the title to his ship, the ''[[Cobra]]'', on the table. Raynor won the entire pot with an [[Idiot's Array/Legends|Idiot's Array]], the highest possible hand. Lobot, however, soon discovered that someone had cheated by placing a [[Skifter/Legends|skifter]] in the game, and they learned from the dealer that [[Barpotomous Drebble/Legends|Barpotomous Drebble]], a nemesis of Calrissian's, had paid him to cheat. Raynor was furious at Drebble and ordered him arrested, promising an unpleasant reprisal at a later juncture. When Calrissian confronted him about continuing the game, Raynor brushed him off and refused to return his winnings; as far as he was concerned, even though someone else had cheated for him, he had won fair and square.<ref name=\"LL\" />\n\n[[File:Lando_vs_Dominic.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Calrissian and Raynor's second match]]\nLobot, however, approached Calrissian with an anonymous donation of five million credits, claiming it to be from individuals who wanted the game to continue&mdash;but, unbeknownst to either player, the funds were actually a collection from fifty thousand workers who wanted Raynor out of office. Raynor was eager to begin a new game, and this one rose to four million credits before Calrissian added a new bet: his [[Starship/Legends|starship]] lot on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] against Raynor's post as Baron Administrator. Raynor laughed at the prospect of pitting his city against Calrissian's \"scrap heap\" until Calrissian informed him that it included three rare pre-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] [[Surronian Farstar]] ships, a collector's item. Raynor took the bet, and Calrissian laid down a [[Pure Sabacc/Legends|Pure Sabacc]], winning the hand and the city. Raynor, enraged, ordered Calrissian arrested, but the guards refused the now-former Baron Administrator's orders. Calrissian let Raynor go, and Ymile went with Raynor, delighted that she would now be able to travel. Raynor threatened Calrissian as he left,<ref name=\"LL\" /> and he was in such a furor that he forgot to take the ''Cobra'' with him when he departed the city.<ref name=\"IA\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080522/index.html|text=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|int=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-lando-calrissian-idiots-array.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}}</ref> Though there was a question of legitimacy of Calrissian's ascension to the office, as Raynor had not actually nominated him, neither the Exex nor Parliament objected.<ref name=\"GNN\" />\n\n===Revenge===\n{{Quote|Men like Dominic Raynor have more than money: They have power, and that means they have friends who'll make sure I'm back on your trail before you even have time to wax that ridiculous mustache.|Thune, to Calrissian|Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array}}\nRaynor would come to make good on his threat.

Bossk and his group of mercenaries [[Ambush in Cloud City|ambushed]] Calrissian in Cloud City,<ref name=\"SLR\" /> but the man survived.<ref name=\"ESB\">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref>\n\nCalrissian believed two further assassins&mdash;a [[Gank/Legends|Gank]] killer and a [[Human replica droid]] impersonating [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Sarna (Queen)|Sarna]] of [[Drogheda/Legends|Drogheda]]&mdash;to have been sent by Raynor as well. Over a month after losing his position, Raynor hired the bounty hunter [[Thune (bounty hunter)|Thune]] to kill both Calrissian and Lobot for 200,000 credits. However, Calrissian outsmarted Thune and blackmailed her to call off the hunt for him, then hired her to capture Raynor instead. Raynor was taken in a matter of days and given to the interrogators of [[Bwahl]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], an associate of Calrissian's. They pressured Raynor into dropping his grudge.<ref name=\"IA\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Raynor_SMASH.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Raynor loses.]]\n{{Quote|Winning is secondary, Baron.
