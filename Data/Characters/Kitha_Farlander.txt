Early in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Destruction of Tondatha|attack]] on the town killed her [[Keyan Farlander's mother|mother]] and [[Keyan Farlander's father|father]] and left her with severe burns. Following the attack, her brother [[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan]] sent her to live with relatives on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Oorn Tchis]], while he joined the [[Agamar Resistance]] and later the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Her [[Mimya|aunt]] and [[Trinn|uncle]] arranged for her to receive treatment for her injuries, though her recovery was slow.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Farlander.svg|thumb|left|200px|Farlander's brother, Keyan]]\n{{Quote|People of Tondatha, on the planet of Agamar, in the Lahara sector &hellip; You have been found guilty of sedition against the Empire, and of plotting against the great Emperor Palpatine.

The Imperials launched an assault craft into the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]], from where it launched an [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] which left Tondatha in ruins. During the [[Destruction of Tondatha|assault]], a direct [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] strike on the Farlander family resulted in the young [[Agamarian]] suffering severe burns that left her disfigured. Though her brother survived with only minor burns, both of their parents were killed in the attack.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the Imperial attack, Keyan decided to move to the Agamarian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Calna Muun]] and join the fledgling [[Agamar Resistance]]. Keyan sent Kitha to live with their aunt [[Mimya]] and uncle [[Trinn]] on [[Oorn Tchis]], where he hoped she would be able to receive treatment. Mimya and Trinn ensured that Farlander was cared for at all times and arranged for [[Doctor/Legends|doctors]] to treat her injuries. Though she did not initially respond to treatment, the physicians advised the family not to give up hope. Some time later, after Keyan had joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], his aunt and uncle wrote to update him of Kitha's progress.
