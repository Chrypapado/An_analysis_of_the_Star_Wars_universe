What happens to me now, Wicket? I'm all alone.|Cindel Towani|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\n'''Cindel Towani''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] during the time of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], when she was five [[Standard year/Legends|standard years]] of age, the [[Towani family]]'s [[Towani family star cruiser|starcruiser]] crash-landed on the [[Tree/Legends|forest]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. Soon after, her parents, [[Jeremitt Towani|Jeremitt]] and [[Catarine Towani|Catarine]] were abducted by the native [[Gorax/Legends|Gorax]], leaving Cindel and her teenage brother [[Mace Towani|Mace]] to fend for themselves. The two children were found by the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Deej Warrick]] and taken to live with his [[Warrick family/Legends|family]] in their [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|village]]. After learning that Jeremitt and Catarine were being held in the Gorax's [[Forbidden Fortress of the Gorax|lair]] in the [[Desert of Salma]], the Towani children enlisted the help of the Ewoks and set off to rescue their parents. After a long journey, the group reached and defeated the Gorax and the Towani family were reunited.\n\nThe Towanis remained with the Ewoks while Jeremitt worked to repair their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], and Cindel became friends with Deej Warrick's youngest son, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket]]. Later that year, however, the Ewok village was [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|attacked]] by a group of [[Sanyassan|Sanyassan Marauders]] led by [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]] and the [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomiri]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] [[Charal]]. Jeremitt, Catarine, and Mace were all [[Death/Legends|killed]] defending the Ewok village, but Cindel was able to escape with Wicket. Towani and Warrick were eventually taken in by another stranded Human, an old man named [[Noa Briqualon]], and his companion [[Teek]]. Towani was subsequently kidnapped by the Sanyassans, who believed that she held the key to their escape from Endor, but Briqualon, Warrick and Teek rescued her from [[Terak's Keep]]. Pursued by Terak's forces, the group joined up with the other Ewoks and managed to [[Battle of Endor (Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict)|defeat]] the Sanyassans and kill Terak.\n\nFollowing the battle, Towani and Briqualon were able to leave the [[Endor (planet)/Legends|Endor]] moon using the [[Crystal oscillator|power cell]] of the Towani family's starcruiser to repair [[Noa Briqualon's starship|Briqualon's starship]]. Towani traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] with Briqualon for some [[Time/Legends|time]] before he retired in the [[Mid Rim]]. Towani settled on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and became a journalist with [[The Life Monitor]]. During the [[Black Fleet Crisis]] in [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]], a news story in which Towani leaked information about the [[Yevetha]]n [[Battle of Polneye|attack]] on [[Polneye]] helped garner public support for New Republic intervention.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I wish we had furry creatures like you where I came from.|Cindel Towani, to Wicket W.

Jeremitt and Catarine were concerned for their children's well-being in the unfamiliar forest and forbade them from leaving the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] and the protection it provided. One [[Standard day/Legends|day]], when Jeremitt and Catarine left to search for a [[Transmitter/Legends|transmitter]], the Towani siblings left the ship and went to explore the forest. They returned to find no sign of their [[Parent/Legends|parents]], unaware that Jeremitt and Catarine had been captured by the giant [[Gorax/Legends|Gorax]] creature.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mace Towani and the Warrick family tend to the sick Towani.]]\nThe two children were forced to forage for their own food<ref name=\"EGC\" /> but, with their parents' [[life monitor]] signals indicating that they were still alive, they stayed with the crashed ship and waited for their parents to return. Some time later the local [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Deej Warrick]] and his sons [[Weechee Warrick|Weechee]] and [[Widdle Warrick/Legends|Willy]] came to investigate the crash site. The Ewoks found Towani hiding inside the ship but Mace, fearing that they may have been responsible for his parents' disappearance, attacked the Ewoks, threatening them with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. He was soon overpowered by the Ewoks, and they led both children back to their [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|village]], where it became clear that they intended no harm.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nNot long after arriving at the village, exposure to the strange environment<ref name=\"EGC\" /> started to take its toll, and Towani complained that she felt unwell. Mace assumed she was merely hungry, but it became clear that it was something more serious when she [[Sleep/Legends|lost consciousness]]. Fortunately for her, the Ewoks were aware of a [[Senoti|fluid]] secreted by a tree in the forest which they had used as medicine for generations. The small amount they had available was enough to revive Towani, but she was still in pain and suffering from a fever. The Ewoks, together with her brother, made a trip to the forest and retrieved more medicine, but the children would have to stay with the Ewoks while Towani rested and recovered her strength.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel2.jpg|thumb|250px|Towani plays with Wicket.]]\nDuring their stay with the Ewoks, Towani became friends with Deej's youngest son, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket]], and even taught the young Ewok some words in [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]]. Towani found their stay with the Ewoks reassuring, providing her with some stability in the absence of her parents, whose disappearance she could not understand and whom she feared [[Death/Legends|dead]]. However, Towani's brother was eager to return to the ship in the hopes of finding their parents. While the Ewoks slept, Towani was woken by her brother and the two children ran off into the forest.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nTowani found the long journey tiring, but when the children stopped for a rest, they came under attack from a [[Boar-wolf/Legends|boar-wolf]] and were forced to take refuge in a hollow tree. Though the creature appeared to leave, Mace decided that they should rest in the tree for the night and resume their journey in the morning. They awoke to find the boar-wolf still in the area, fighting Deej and his sons, who had come in search of the children. The Ewoks were eventually able to kill the boar-wolf, but Mace discovered his father's life monitor on the creature. It became clear that the children would have to locate the boar-wolf's master if they were to be reunited with their parents.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n===The caravan===\n{{Quote|Please help us. They're gonna die!|Cindel, asking the Ewoks for help|Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure}}\nBack at the village, Mace attempted to find out from the Ewoks where the boar-wolf had come from. The Ewoks took the children to see the village [[Shaman/Legends|shaman]], [[Logray/Legends|Logray]]. Logray used a [[crystal image spinner]] to show them a vision of their parents being held by the Gorax in a forbidden land from which no Ewok had ever returned. Though the Ewoks were aware of the dangers that awaited them, Deej and his sons soon agreed to Towani's request to help her and Mace find their parents.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The members of the caravan consult Logray.]]\nThe next day, as the whole village got together to help them load supplies for the long journey ahead, the Towani siblings and the others were called to Logray for a ceremony in which he bestowed upon them the totems of legendary Ewok warriors. During the ceremony, Towani received the [[Candle of Pure Light]].<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nThe caravan soon set off with the older Ewoks traveling on [[Horse/Legends|horseback]] and Towani riding with Wicket in a large basket mounted on the back of a horse&mdash;Mace opted to walk rather than ride with the children. Not long into their journey they encountered the Ewok woodsman, [[Chukha-Trok/Legends|Chukha-Trok]], when a tree he cut down narrowly missed Towani as it fell to the ground. After some persuasion from the Ewoks and Mace, Chukha-Trok agreed to join the caravan.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nThey next encountered the Ewok [[Priest/Legends|priestess]], [[Kaink]], who agreed to join them only if they could pass a magical test. Mace stepped forward to take the test but, upon touching the crystal she presented to him, he failed the test when it turned into a [[Lizard/Legends|lizard]]. Kaink was reluctant to help until Towani picked up the lizard, causing it to turn into a [[Mouse/Legends|mouse]], and passed the test. Kaink agreed to join the group and, the caravan complete, they resumed their long journey.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel3.jpg|thumb|250px|Towani holds the Candle of Pure Light.]]\nThe group later stopped for a rest near a [[Endor magic lake|river]]. As Wicket and Towani played, Mace Towani walked down to the river bank but, upon touching the [[Water/Legends|water]], was pulled into it and was unable to get out. Towani alerted the Ewoks, but every attempt they made to throw something to Towani's brother resulted in it disappearing as soon as it touched the water. Eventually, Towani remembered a magic walking stick that Logray had given to Wicket, and the young Ewok used it to pull Mace to safety.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nThe group was just about to resume their journey after one stop when, after Mace loaded Towani into the basket, a sudden noise startled her horse, causing it to flee. Chukha-Trok was quick to act, mounting his horse and pursuing Towani into the forest. He eventually managed to catch up with her and, after bringing her horse under control, they returned to the group. Towani discovered the power of the [[Candle/Legends|Candle]] of Pure Light when, after stopping for the night, they encountered a swarm of [[Wistie/Legends|Wisties]]. Wicket woke Towani, who brought the Candle of Pure Light outside and, drawn to the light, all but one of the Wisties<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" /> used it to find their way home<ref name=\"EGC\" />&mdash;Mace decided to take the last Wistie with him.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n===Reunion===\n{{Quote|We thought you were dead.''\"<br />\"''Oh, darling!|Towani is reunited with her mother|Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure}}\nThe long journey was starting to take its toll, and the group was running low on food when they finally reached the [[Desert of Salma]], on the other side of which lay the [[Forbidden Fortress of the Gorax]]. After finding an entrance to a tunnel under the [[Mountain/Legends|mountain]] fortress, the group headed inside, but Deej refused to let the youngest members of the group go any further, believing that it was too dangerous. Mace agreed and, as the others proceeded further into the fortress, Towani, Willy, and Wicket remained at the entrance to the tunnel. However, they were not as safe as Deej had hoped. Soon after the others had left, the children were attacked by a large [[Spider/Legends|spider]]. Wicket fought the spider and eventually managed to kill the creature with a [[Knife/Legends|knife]].<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Towani, Wicket, and Willy are attacked by the Gorax.]]\nMeanwhile, the others had located Jeremitt and Catarine, trapped in a cage suspended from the roof of a cave. No sooner had they freed them than the Gorax attacked. Mace released the Wistie he had captured earlier, which distracted the Gorax, enabling the others to flee. The Gorax pursued, but they managed to apparently kill it, causing the giant to fall down a deep chasm. However, Chukha-Trok was killed in the encounter.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nMoments later, as Towani, Willy, and Wicket appeared at the entrance to the cave, the Gorax climbed back to the top of the chasm and attacked the children. Mace acted quickly to grab Chukha-Trok's [[axe]] and threw it at the Gorax, causing the giant to lose its grip and fall once more into the chasm.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nWith the Gorax dead, Towani had an emotional reunion with her parents and they set off on the long journey back to Bright Tree Village.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" /> There, the two families celebrated together, and Logray presented Towani, along with Mace and the Ewoks, with white ear-wing headdresses to mark their heroism.<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n\n===Sanyassan attack===\n{{Quote|Cindel, I'll always be with you.|Jeremitt Towani says goodbye to Towani|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\nThe Towani family remained at Bright Tree Village for several [[Standard month/Legends|months]] while Jeremitt attempted to repair their ship. During that time, Towani became good friends with Wicket, spending their days having imaginary adventures in the forest and continuing Wicket's instruction in Basic.<ref name=\"EGC\" /> The repairs proceeded well and it eventually appeared that they would soon be able to return home. Though Towani was reluctant to leave Wicket, she was looking forward to going home and resuming a normal life.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\">''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''</ref>\n\nOne day the two youngsters returned to the village after playing nearby, to find the Ewoks under [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|attack]] from [[Sanyassan Marauders]]. The Ewoks were fighting bravely but were being overpowered by the [[Sanyassan]]s' more advanced technology. Telling Towani to take cover, Wicket went running off to help his people.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel6.jpg|thumb|250px|Towani and her father hide from a Sanyassan patrol.]]\nMoments later, Towani saw on her life monitor that her mother's life signal was weakening. Leaving her hiding place, Towani ran into the village to find her mother. When Towani located Catarine, she was lying motionless on the floor while Mace crouched beside her, engaged in a [[Lightfight|firefight]] with the Sanyassans. Upon seeing Towani, her brother told her to run back to the ship and find their father, who had been working on repairs there when the attack begun. As Towani fled into the forest, she saw her mother and brother's life signal indicators go out on her life monitor. Towani ran straight back to the shuttle but arrived to discover her father surrounded by Sanyassans, led by [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]] and<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" /> the rogue [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomiri]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]]<ref name=\"DB-Charal\">{{DB|character|charal|Charal|archivedate=20100210002041}}</ref> [[Charal]].<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\nThe Sanyassans were tearing the ship apart in the hope of finding a power source for their own crashed vessel in order to flee Endor,<ref name=\"Fact File\" /> ultimately finding what they sought when they discovered the ship's [[crystal oscillator]].<ref name=\"EGC\" /> Seeing his daughter arriving, Jeremitt took advantage of the Sanyassans' momentary distraction to attempt to take a weapon and escape, grabbing Towani as he fled. However, he was shot and wounded in the attempt. Hiding in the forest, Jeremitt reminded Towani of a story he used to tell about a [[Bird/Legends|bird]] blown out of its nest in a storm which had to learn to fly to survive. With Catarine and Mace dead and him wounded, he told her that she would have to be like the bird and be brave until she could find her way back to Deej and the other Ewoks. As the Sanyassans discovered their position, Jeremitt told Towani to run and attempted to hold the Sanyassans off with his blaster. As Towani fled, her father's life signal faded out.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n===Escape===\n{{Quote|You are a pretty prize.|Terak, to the captive Towani|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\nTowani's attempt to escape soon failed as she was caught by Charal and taken back to Bright Tree Village, where she was locked in a [[Wagon/Legends|wagon]] with the Ewok [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] which soon set off for [[Terak's Keep]]. Once in the wagon, she discovered that Wicket had also been captured. Wicket, whose Basic was by now quite good, attempted to console her on the death of her family, telling her not to lose hope and promising that the Ewoks would take care of her. It wasn't long before the Ewoks formulated an escape plan, managing to pry up one of the wagon's floorboards. The hole wasn't big enough for a fully grown Ewok to fit through, but the Ewoks helped both Towani and Wicket through the hole and they dropped down to the ground below, almost getting trampled by a [[Blurrg/Legends|blurrg]] and having to move quickly to the undergrowth as the Sanyassan [[Convoy/Legends|convoy]] continued on its journey.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel7.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Towani in the talons of a condor dragon]]\nHowever, their escape did not go unnoticed, and two Sanyassan guards pursued them into the trees. As they fled, they came across a large mountain and had to traverse a narrow ledge around it. The Sanyassans followed, firing their weapons and causing a rock slide. Towani and Wicket were able to escape into a small cave opening but their pursuers were killed. With the entrance to the cave blocked by the rock slide, Towani and Wicket had no choice other than to proceed further into the cave in search of another way out&mdash;they eventually found one, but the exit was high off the ground and the mountainside was far too steep for them to climb down. As Towani rested, Wicket began to search the cave, finding several large [[Bone/Legends|bones]] and some tattered fabric from which he constructed a [[hang glider]]. However, Wicket managed to wake a [[Condor dragon/Legends|condor dragon]] which grabbed Towani in its talons and flew out of the cave with its prey. Grabbing some rocks, Wicket pursued in his hang glider. After maneuvering over the top of the dragon, Wicket dropped a rock on it, causing it to let go of Towani. As she plummeted to the ground, Wicket swooped down and managed to catch her, but the glider was damaged in the process and they crashed into the forest. Unharmed by the crash and seeing the dragon circling overhead, the two children ran through the trees until they lost the beast. Exhausted, they stopped to rest in the relative safety of a hollow tree overnight.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n===The castaway===\n{{Quote|Thank you for building the fire.

Best friend.|Towani and Wicket|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\n[[File:Cindel8.jpg|thumb|250px|Towani and Wicket discover Noa Briqualon's ship.]]\nThe next morning they were woken by the arrival of a [[Teek (species)/Legends|Teek]] named [[Teek]]. Wicket was suspicious of the creature, but Towani hoped that it could lead them to food. Teek, who seemed to understand her, motioned for them to follow and ran off, leading them to a [[Noa Briqualon's hut|cabin]] in a glade in the forest. Mistakenly believing that the cabin was abandoned, the two children decided to take refuge there but were soon interrupted when the cabin's owner, the adult Human [[Noa Briqualon]], returned home. Briqualon was angry to find that his companion, Teek, had led strangers to his house and told them to leave. Cold and hungry, Towani and Wicket decided to spend the night near the cabin where they hoped it would be safe. When Wicket later lit a [[Fire/Legends|fire]], Briqualon emerged and put it out. Having had a change of [[Heart/Legends|heart]], he told them that they could stay in the cabin for the night but must leave in the morning. During the night, the traumatic events that Towani had experienced recently manifested themselves as she slept, causing her to [[Dream/Legends|dream]] that the Sanyassans were attacking the cabin. After Towani woke suddenly from her nightmare, Briqualon comforted her and, clearly warming somewhat to the newcomers, he allowed Towani and Wicket to take his bed for the night.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\nDespite Briqualon's original insistence that they leave the next morning, he allowed them to stay so long as they made themselves useful and participated in chores around the cabin. Wicket, however, was growing eager to find his family. Towani became curious where Briqualon went during the day and one day persuaded Wicket to help her follow him. Briqualon led them to a clearing in which lay a [[Noa Briqualon's starship|crashed starship]]. After discovering that he had been followed, Briqualon told Towani and Wicket his story. Decades earlier, Briqualon had crashed on Endor along with his friend [[Salak Weet]]. With their power system damaged, Weet had gone in search of a replacement and never returned, and Briqualon had been trapped there ever since.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n===Battle for Endor===\n{{Quote|Goodbye. Goodbye.''\"<br />\"''Goodbye. Not good.|Towani and Wicket say goodbye|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\nMeanwhile, Charal had been unable to produce power from the stolen crystal oscillator. Terak was furious with the Nightsister, but she suggested that Towani might know how to make it work. Using a [[Talisman of the Raven|magic ring]] she transformed into a [[raven]] and set out to find Towani, a search which led her to Briqualon's cabin.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\nEarly the next morning, Towani awoke to hear her name being called from the forest. Going to investigate, she found a woman singing a [[Music/Legends|song]] that Catarine used to sing to Towani. Meanwhile, Wicket woke to discover Towani was missing and quickly roused Briqualon. The two began a search of the forest but, as they closed in on Towani's location, the woman transformed into Charal and kidnapped Towani, riding away on a horse before Briqualon and Wicket could intervene. Briqualon and Wicket returned to the cabin for supplies and, along with Teek, set off to rescue Towani.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel9.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Towani in Terak's dungeon]]\nCharal took Towani to Terak's Keep where she was taken before the Sanyassan leader, who demanded that she use her magic to make the crystal oscillator work. When Towani informed him that she couldn't do as he asked, he informed her that she would have until dawn to comply, otherwise he would kill her and the Ewok prisoners. Towani was taken to a [[Prison/Legends|dungeon]] where she was locked in a small cage. Charal was also imprisoned as punishment for her failure and her [[Ring/Legends|ring]] was confiscated. While there, Towani learned from Charal that years earlier, Salak Weet had come seeking a new source of power for his ship. When Terak mistook that for power that he could possess, he had killed Weet and now believed that the crystal oscillator was the power source he sought. During the conversation, Towani unwittingly revealed the existence of Briqualon's ship.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\nBriqualon, Wicket and Teek succeeded in gaining entry to Terak's Keep and, disguised in the robes of a Sanyassan, they made their way to the dungeon. After eliminating the guards, Wicket released Towani and the Ewoks&mdash;he was about to release Charal, but Towani stopped him and threw away the key. As the group attempted to escape, they were seen by a guard who raised the alarm. Trapped in a dead end, Briqualon produced a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] and blew a hole in the wall. After attaching a [[Grappling hook/Legends|grappling hook]] to some rocks on the far side of the [[castle]]'s moat, the Ewoks began to climb down a rope to safety. When Towani mentioned what she learned about Weet's fate and the Sanyassan possession of a crystal oscillator, Briqualon realized that he could use the device to power his ship, and quickly retrieved it before he and Towani followed the Ewoks out of the castle. The escapees returned to the forest and Briqualon's ship, but they were followed by Charal&mdash;the Nightsister had told Terak about Briqualon's ship in exchange for sparing her life and had been allowed to transform into a raven to locate it. Knowing that it was only a matter of time before the Sanyassans arrived, Briqualon told the Ewoks to hold them off while he and Towani attempted to install the crystal oscillator and restore power to his ship.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Cindel10.jpg|thumb|250px|Towani is abducted by Terak.]]\nWith Charal leading the way, it was not long before Terak led his forces to Briqualon's ship. Their approach was slowed by the hastily mounted Ewok defense, but the Sanyassans [[Battle of Endor (Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict)|slowly pushed]] the Ewoks back toward the ship. Terak's forces finally reached the ship just as Briqualon restored power and, after he turned the ship's firepower on them, the Sanyassan attack was routed. During the fight, Towani saw Wicket get caught in one of the traps Briqualon had set up to protect the ship. With Sanyassans closing on Wicket's position, Towani left the ship to help her friend. Towani's arrival distracted the Sanyassans long enough for Deej to eliminate them and save his son but, as Wicket was released from the trap, Terak emerged from the undergrowth and grabbed Towani. Terak told the Ewoks that he would trade Towani's life for the crystal oscillator. Briqualon had little choice and emerged with the oscillator, agreeing to fight Terak for it if he let Towani go. Terak agreed and let Towani go, but Briqualon was quickly overpowered by his opponent. As Terak moved in for the kill, Wicket threw a well-aimed stone at the magic ring hanging around Terak's neck. The blow caused the power of the ring to be unleashed, turning the Sanyassan king into stone.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\nWith power restored to Briqualon's ship, he could finally leave Endor, and Towani decided to go with him. Before they left, the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village gathered at Briqualon's ship for an emotional farewell, and Towani promised to return and see Wicket and Teek as soon as she could.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" />\n\n===Later life===\n{{Quote|Personal to Cindel Towani.

When her parents were abducted by the Gorax, Towani missed them and feared that they were dead, but took strength from her brother's presence. Towani quickly came to trust the Ewoks when they discovered her and Mace, something which took her more cynical brother some time to do. She formed an instant rapport with Wicket Warrick and the two would frequently play together, even during their perilous journey to the Desert of Salma. Towani was also able to teach her friend to speak Basic. She was later quick to make friends with Teek and Noa Briqualon.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" />\n\nTowani was also very inquisitive, and it was this curiosity that led her and Warrick to follow Noa Briqualon to his ship. Her curiosity combined with her trusting nature could also get her into trouble, and it was these personality traits that Charal exploited to draw her away from the safety of Briqualon's cabin and kidnap her.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" /> Even as a child, Towani showed bravery in the face of the numerous dangers she faced on Endor. Undeterred by the risks to herself, she was determined to rescue her parents from the Gorax.<ref name=\"Caravan of Courage\" /> The deaths of her family left Towani experiencing nightmares as she struggled to overcome her loss. Without Mace to draw strength from, Towani took comfort in her friendship with Warrick and came to terms with the loss of her family after Briqualon reassured her that they were not truly gone as long as she remembered them.<ref name=\"The Battle for Endor\" /> Briqualon became an important figure in Towani's life, and she chose to travel with him for many years after leaving Endor.<ref name=\"DB-Noa\" />\n\nThe qualities she displayed as a child would be of use to her as she grew into an intelligent and idealistic young journalist.<ref name=\"DB-Cindel\" /> It was these traits that brought her to the attention of Hiram Drayson as he sought somebody who would set the appropriate tone for his leaked story and would be willing to risk a shutdown order to break the story.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCindel Towani was created by [[George Lucas]] for the [[1984]] made-for-TV film ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]''.<ref name=\"EA\">{{SWArchive|url=eu/tv/classic/f20000824/indexp2.html|text=Ewok Adventures: Visual Effects|archivedate=20080622081340}}</ref> After a successful screen test with Mace Towani actor [[Eric Walker]], the part of Cindel Towani was given to four-year old [[Aubree Miller]]. In addition to the movie, Miller portrayed Towani in a short promotional video for [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] in which the Towani children and Kaink visit a [[1950s]]-style diner, but this was not aired when Lucas objected to the characters appearing on Earth in the 1950s.

Lucas's daughter, [[Amanda Lucas|Amanda]], was a similar age to Towani and the character was her hero.
