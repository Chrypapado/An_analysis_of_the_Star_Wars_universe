In about [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Ooorlak went to lunch on Cularin with two of his associates, the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Renna (Rodian)|Renna]] and the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sal]], and they shared a [[kaavo]] that had been prepared by the baker [[Val-Aruun]]. Soon, there was only one slice of kaavo left, so Sal proposed that they hold a trial of elocution to decide who got to eat the slice. The trio each told a story about a loved one who had [[Death/Legends|passed away]], and they planned to give the slice of kaavo to the person who told the best story. Ooorlak chose to talk about his kinsman [[Kirlocca]], a Wookiee [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who had died [[21 BBY/Legends|two years earlier]] while defending the delegates of a conference that took place aboard the [[Luxury liner/Legends|liner]] ''[[Luxury]]''. Afterward, the trio could not decide which one of them had won the contest, and they decided to leave the slice of kaavo at the [[Wall of Remembrance]] in the [[Crosstown Bar]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060223Cradle|text=Living Force: From the Cradle to the Grave|int=Living Force: From the Cradle to the Grave|archivedate=20091016005600}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
