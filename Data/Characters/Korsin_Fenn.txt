Fenn was a reserved individual and was very reluctant to divulge any information on his patronage. However, he warmed quickly to people that he found trustworthy and was particularly fond of fellow Bothans.\n\n==Pyke entanglements==\nAt some point Fenn became involved in [[Pyke Syndicate/Legends|Pyke Syndicate]] affairs, as a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], working for the latter entered his parlor in the search for [[Kaa'to Leeachos]] who had betrayed the Pykes for the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. Although in principle reluctant to share information about his patronage, Fenn felt a bond with one of the spacers - namely, a fellow Bothan and member of Fenn's clan, [[Jovel Nial]]. Jovel and her colleagues managed to persuade Fenn into providing information on Leaachos, who had been banned from The Spyder for owing the place around 20,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Because The Spyder was frequented by Black Sun operatives, Fenn could also point the spacers to Black Sun individuals that were useful to be in contact with. In exchange for this information, the spacers agreed to help Fenn get his money back.\n\n==Behin the scenes==\nFenn appears in the ''[[Under a Black Sun]]'' scenario. Promising to help him get his money back is presented in the scenario as a negotiation strategy to get the information from Fenn.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Under a Black Sun]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fenn, Korsin}}\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
