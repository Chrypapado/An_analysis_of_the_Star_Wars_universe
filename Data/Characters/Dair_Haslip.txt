In [[11 BBY/Legends|11 BBY]], his parents, [[West Haslip|West]] and [[Nieka Haslip]], were killed by a Sundar attack, during the [[Garosian Civil War]]. He was later raised by his grandmother, [[Keriin Haslip]].<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\n[[File:Dair_and_scoutrooper.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Dair shoots down the scout trooper who killed his friend.]]\nIn [[6 BBY/Legends|6 BBY]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] established an official presence on Garos IV and ended the civil war. Very enthusiastic, Dair Haslip decided to join the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]]. However some days before entering at the [[Raithal Academy/Legends|Raithal Academy]], he was walking around Garos IV with his childhood friend [[Jos Mayda]] when they were attacked by two Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout troopers]]. Jos was shot down for no reason and Dair killed them. He related the event to his grandmother who introduced him to the [[Committee of Seven for Garosian Unification|Garos resistance]]. Dair was disgusted by the methods of the Empire but the members of the resistance convinced him to enter the academy as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]].<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nHe joined the Empire at the age of 19 with the sole purpose of spying on them and passing on information to the Garosian underground. After seven years away from his homeworld, he was finally stationed as an administrative assistant to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Zakar (Imperial)|Zakar]] on Garos.\n\nHe would work closely with [[Alexandra Winger]]&mdash;daughter of [[Tork Winger|the local Imperial governor]]&mdash;who was also a member of the resistance. In order not to arouse any suspicion, Dair and Alexandra would feign a secret love affair. Their pretense fooled the Imperials into thinking that the two of them spent so much time together in the name of Romance, while they were in reality plotting against the Empire. Their feigned affair developed into genuine infatuation on Dair's part, who accepted that Winger did not feel the same way.\n\nDair was the grandson of the [[Keriin Haslip]] and [[Trenar Stillijan]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}\n*{{Journal|2|Whispers in the Dark}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|3|Mission to Zila}}\n*{{Journal|4|Shadows of Darkness}}\n*{{Journal|12|Betrayal by Knight}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/fiction/shadesofgray/index.html|text=''Shades of Gray''|int=Shades of Gray|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-shades-of-gray-from-the-adventures-of-alex-winger.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haslip, Dair}}\n[[Category:Garosians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
