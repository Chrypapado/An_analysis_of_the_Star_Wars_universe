He governed the [[Spice/Legends|spice]] rich [[Equatorial Belt]] of [[Sevarcos II]]. He was quite trim for his age and, to many, was considered a paragon of health and strength.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Lord_Rha's_Mountain_Keep.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Lord Rha's Mountain Keep.]]\n===A ruthless ruler===\nCassius Nolath Rha was known for his ruthlessness, owning an impressive [[slave galley]] called the ''[[Andris Moon]]'', which was operated by hundreds of [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]]. He also had several [[Fortress/Legends|fortresses]], residing in one placed on the border of the [[Northern Frontier]]. Rha commanded a small unit of fanatically-loyal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] called the [[Spice Blades]], whom he controlled and manipulated, using [[Carsunum/Legends|black spice]].\n\n===Relations with the Empire===\nRha was by far the most powerful spice lord of his time, much to the envy of [[Xerxes Quintas]] and [[Trevael]]&mdash;having cut a profitable deal with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], allowing them to establish space mining prison colonies and mine excessively for spice and paying him a considerable amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] for it. He would constantly be courting to the Imperial [[planetary commandant]] to maintain his \"good\" relations with the Empire. In reality, however, he did not care much for the Empire, using it instead as a tool for his own wealth.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|12|Festival of High Winds}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|2|The Free-Trader's Guide to Sevarcos}} {{1stm}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Free-Trader's Guide to Sevarcos}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rha, Cassius Nolath}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sevari]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]"}}}]}}}}
