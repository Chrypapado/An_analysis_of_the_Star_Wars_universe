Because [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Kimp Minmirn]] had not paid his docking fees, [[Peacekeeper (Prosperity)|Peacekeeper]] [[Darial Anglethorn]] ordered Lorrb to place an [[impoundment transmitter]] in his [[Starship/Legends|starship]]. When [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mils Giel]] later fled the planet after being caught mutating the planet's native [[Tirrith]] population into his personal assassination force, with Minmirn's assistance, he stole the Quarran's ship to make his escape. Lorrb had stored the transmitter's frequency in his [[Droid/Legends|droid]] and, as Giel was unaware of the tracking device, the Beheboth [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police force]] planned to use the device to follow the criminal.<ref name=\"Blood\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLorrb was briefly mentioned in part four of ''[[Beheboth: Blood and Water]]'', [[Beheboth: Blood and Water, Part 4: Hit and Mist|''Hit and Mist'']], a supplement to the [[Wizards of the Coast]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying game]].
