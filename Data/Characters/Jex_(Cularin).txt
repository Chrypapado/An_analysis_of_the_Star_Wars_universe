He then waited outside their [[Hedrett]] warehouse and monitored their transmissions for the next day. His data showed no special transmissions made that would indicate a search underway. Consequently, when the Navy of Thaere reported back to Jex 24 [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] later that his brother was not on [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], he suspected they had not actually searched at all. One of Jex's friends took this as evidence that the Thaereians were actually behind the disappearances.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20031002cularin|text=Cularin at Night|int=Cularin at Night|archivedate=20090603045459}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
