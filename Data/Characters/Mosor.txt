By the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], it was rumored that Mosor was behind the construction of a mysterious [[Mosor's Maze|maze]] on Tatooine. The story said that Mosor came home from war and found his wife with his best officer, [[Polen]], who had been previously dismissed due to an unlikely accident. Mosor then built the maze as a monument to his promise of revenge. The night of its completion, he drugged his wife and her lover on [[Vasarian brandy]], dragged them to the maze and sealed them in thereafter, leaving them to die in the heat of Tatooine. However, the accuracy of this story was debated since no corpses had never been found in the maze.<ref name=\"SWG:AEL1\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Jump to Lightspeed}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|An Explorer's Log (1/8)}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]"}}}]}}}}
