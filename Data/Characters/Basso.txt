The resistance created a diversion so that Basso could get past [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces. He was wounded, and taken aboard the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] and put in a [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] tank. Shortly thereafter, he advised Leia about the [[Battle of Kattada]].\n\nHe later participated in the [[Battle of Kalist VI]], where he helped to convince the other [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] to free the slaves.\n\nAlongside [[BL-1707|Able]] and other Rebel operatives, he participated in the [[Battle of Per Lupelo]]. Basso was part of the teams used to board and capture four Imperial ships carrying supplies badly needed by the Rebels.\n\nAfter ''[[Rebel One]]''{{'s}} [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] malfunctioned and landed the ship at [[Bannistar Station/Legends|Bannistar Station]], Basso was a part of the mission that decided to destroy the Station, facing odds that were almost guaranteed to be fatal. Basso was tasked with leading a team to destroy the communications array and to try to find some method for the Rebels to escape.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAn action figure was made in 2008 by Hasbro as a part of their Expanded Universe Comics line.<ref name=\"Hasbro\">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: 30th Anniversary Collection|pack=Mouse & Basso|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/taccomicpacks15.asp|archivedate=20200926145113}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio dramatization]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire: Princess...
