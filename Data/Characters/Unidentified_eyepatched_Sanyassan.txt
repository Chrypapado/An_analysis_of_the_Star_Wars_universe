The [[Sanyassan]] was on guard duty on a curtain wall of [[Terak's Keep]] when [[Noa Briqualon]], [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], and [[Teek]] stormed the [[castle]] to rescue the captive [[Human/Legends|Human]] girl [[Cindel Towani]]. When the Sanyassan noticed Briqualon climbing a [[Rope/Legends|rope]] and scaling the side of the castle, he prepared to fire his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]&mdash;little did he know that Warrick had tied the other end of the rope around his ankle. A shove from Warrick sent the Sanyassan tumbling over the side of the curtain wall and into the moat below while simultaneously propelling Briqualon to the top.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Sanyassans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
