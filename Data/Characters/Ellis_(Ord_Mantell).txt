Their son [[Paul]] disappeared one day and remained missing for years, during which the couple struggled together. By [[3643 BBY]] they found themselves in the refugee camp outside [[Fort Garnik]], just on the outskirts of the war zone. It was at this time that Ellis was informed by a woman named [[Jenna (Ord Mantell)|Jenna]] that she saw her son alive at [[Mannett Point]], by this time a [[Mantellian Separatist Movement|separatist]]-controlled territory. Suddenly having hope again, Ellis convinced a friendly [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] individual to confirm whether it was indeed her son. As it turned out, Paul was indeed alive but pumped with rage-inducing stimulants to the point that he did not remember his own name, much less his parents. He was taken off the stims, but was still a danger to others due to extreme aggressiveness, and to avoid facing his parents like this, Paul fled Ord Mantell until the effects of the stims wore off.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki|Ellis}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ellis (Ord Mantell)#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]"}}}]}}}}
