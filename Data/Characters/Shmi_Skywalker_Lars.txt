During her [[time]] as a slave, Shmi Skywalker gave [[Reproduction|birth]] to a [[Youngling|child]] called [[Anakin Skywalker]]. In [[32 BBY]], her son was discovered by [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], who found the boy to be unusually [[Force-sensitive|strong]] with [[the Force]]. He learned through Shmi that there was no father involved in Anakin's conception, leading Jinn to believe that Anakin was conceived by the [[midi-chlorian]]s. With Shmi's support, Anakin was taken by Jinn to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]] and presented to the [[Jedi High Council|leaders]] of the [[Jedi Order]] as the [[Chosen One]]&mdash;the one who was destined to restore balance to the Force, according to [[Jedi]] prophecy.\n\nAfter Anakin left Tatooine to begin his [[Jedi training]], Shmi [[Marriage|married]] [[Cliegg Lars]]&mdash;a [[moisture farmer]] who freed her from slavery&mdash;and became a loving stepmother to his son, [[Owen Lars]]. Her chance to see Anakin one last time came when, in the waning [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Separatist Crisis]], Shmi was [[Prisoner|abducted]] and subjected to [[torture]] by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s in [[22 BBY]]. By then, her son had returned to Tatooine as a Jedi [[Padawan]]. Having seen her son again, Shmi told him she was complete but died in his arms. Unable to prevent his mother's [[Death|demise]], Anakin gave into the [[dark side of the Force]] and massacred the Tusken Raiders, including their women and children, and buried his mother at the [[Lars Homestead|Lars moisture farm]]. Shortly after Shmi's death, her son went on to become a [[Jedi Knight]], as well as a [[Jedi General|general]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during [[the galaxy]]-wide conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]]. The loss of his mother also pushed him to desire the ability to save his loved ones from death, which ultimately pushed Skywalker to become [[Darth Sidious]]'s [[Sith apprentice]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|The Force is unusually strong with him.

When Watto did not need Shmi, he allowed her to gain a modest living cleaning [[computer]] memory devices. She made a small part of their house into a work station, which possessed just enough of the tools and equipment to properly work.<ref name=\"CVD\" /> In addition, Shmi and her son also owned a few personal possessions including an antiquated [[protocol droid]] named [[C-3PO]] and a [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer|podracer]].<ref name=\"TPM\" /> In a rare showing of kindness, Watto also gave her a repulsor-powered magnifier. Kept in her work station, the gift was for the hard work she did.<ref name=\"CVD\" />\n\nOften, however, Watto was unkind, understanding that Shmi had nothing valuable to trade&mdash;other than her son, whom she would never trade&mdash;to stop him from doing what he wished. Thus, Watto took advantage of that all the time, such as how he allowed the boy to [[Podracing|podrace]], much to the anger of Shmi. During one race, she watched, angry at Watto and horrified, as her son crashed yet again, although she realized he had not been thrown from his [[podracer]] for once. Watto approached her, ignoring whatever pain Anakin could be in by claiming he was fine before flying off, ignoring her concern that, one day, her son would be seriously hurt.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref>\n\nAs she had many times before, she made her way down to the racing pit, where she reunited with Anakin but saw that his legs were twisted. While she knew that Watto would pay to ensure his slave's legs recovered, Shmi held onto her son's hand to comfort herself. Before the rustic, yet effective, [[medical droid]]s made Anakin unconscious to work on his legs, Anakin promised he would always be with her, yet Shmi privately promised he would one day leave her for a better life.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\n===Parting ways with her son===\n{{Quote|I will come back and free you, Mom.

While Shmi and her son had initially believed that these offworlders had come to free slaves, they quickly learned that the strangers had become stranded on Tatooine after [[Naboo Royal Starship|their]] [[starship]]'s [[hyperdrive]] was damaged during a [[diplomat]]ic [[Invasion of Naboo|mission]] to [[The galaxy|the galactic]] [[capital]], [[Coruscant]]. When Anakin offered to help Jinn and his companions to obtain [[Currency|money]] for the [[T-14 hyperdrive generator|hyperdrive]] by winning the upcoming [[Boonta Eve Classic]] podrace, Shmi initially disagreed with the idea. However, she relented when Anakin recalled her words on helping others.<ref name=\"TPM\" />\n\n[[File:Discussing_Anakin.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker revealed the truth about her son's parentage to Jinn&mdash;there had been no father.]]\nWhile Anakin repaired his [[podracer]], Shmi told Jinn about her son's birth. Later, Jinn tested Anakin and discovered that he was strong with [[the Force]]. Due to his high concentration of [[midi-chlorian]]s, Jinn believed that Anakin was the prophesied [[Chosen One]]. The following day, Jinn offered to sponsor Anakin for the upcoming Boonta Eve race in return for securing Shmi and her son's emancipation if Anakin won that race. However, Watto was unwilling to relinquish both slaves at the same [[time]]. Instead, they reached a compromise where Watto agreed to free Anakin if he won the race. The following day, Shmi along with the offworld visitors attended the Boonta Eve Classic. Despite great odds, her son Anakin won the race, and Watto was forced to honor his promise to emancipate Anakin.<ref name=\"TPM\" />\n\nFollowing the race, Shmi and her son embraced each other with Shmi expressing pride in her son's achievements. After securing Anakin's earnings from Watto, Jinn informed Shmi that he had secured Anakin's emancipation and offered to [[Jedi training|train]] him as a [[Jedi]]. With much difficulty, Shmi decided to part with her son. Realizing that Anakin would have a better future offworld, Shmi advised her son to grasp this new opportunity and told him to let her go on the rationale that her place and future was on Tatooine. Prior to leaving for his new life on Coruscant, Anakin made a solemn vow that he would return and free her.<ref name=\"TPM\" />\n\n===Emancipation, captivity, and death===\n{{Quote|I'm so proud of you, Ani<!-- This is how it's spelled in the DVD subtitles.

Watto had seemingly dissappeared along with Shmi, and when Sabe asked of her whereabouts, they could only tell her that she had been sold. When passing through Shmi's former residence, she noted a sign on the door that was likely a mark of the local liberation movement on Tatooine. By the end, Sabe's efforts lead her to buy the freedom of over 25 slaves, something she reported back to Amidala. Undeterred, Amidala asked Sabe to continue her efforts to free more slaves on Tatooine.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref> Luckily for Shmi, a [[moisture farmer]] named [[Cliegg Lars]] met and fell in love with her.

After meeting with Watto, Anakin and Amidala arrived at the [[Lars family]] [[farm]] and learned about his mother's fate after Anakin left for Coruscant: freedom, marrying Cliegg and becoming stepmother to [[Owen Lars]], and her kidnapping. Despite Cliegg' warnings and advice, Anakin traveled into the wilderness to find her.

There, Anakin encountered a bound and emaciated Shmi, who was near death. Prior to her death, she managed to tell her son that she was proud of him and that she loved him. Shmi's death threw Anakin into a fit of rage, and he took his first step to the [[dark side of the Force]]. In his rage, Anakin avenged his mother by coldly killing every Tusken Raider in the encampment, including the women and [[Youngling|children]].
