I'm sorry. I forgive you, Tseebo!''\"<br />\"''I, too, am sorry. Forgive me for everything. |Ezra Bridger and Tseebo|Gathering Forces}}\n'''Tseebo''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[Rodian]] who worked for the [[Imperial Information Office]] on [[Lothal]]. He was outfitted with an [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]] containing information vital to the [[Galactic Empire]], including a five [[Standard year|year]] plan for the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. About four years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Tseebo went missing; prompting an Imperial manhunt that involved the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] and the [[Jedi]] hunter known as [[the Grand Inquisitor]]. Tseebo was eventually found by [[Ezra Bridger]], whose parents Tseebo had known, and the [[Spectres|rebels]], who rescued him from the Empire and arranged for him to go into hiding.\n\n==Biography==\n===Friend of the Bridgers===\nTseebo was a close friend of [[Ezra Bridger]]'s parents, [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]] and [[Mira Bridger|Mira]]. However, he was concerned that their anti-Imperial activities would endanger their son's safety. Tseebo tried to warn Ephraim and Mira but the couple insisting on standing up for what they believed in. When the [[Galactic Empire]] arrested Ephraim and Mira, Tseebo did nothing to stop them. Their son Ezra was forced to eke out a living in the streets of Lothal's [[Capital City]]. Burdened by guilt, Tseebo went to work for the [[Imperial Information Office]]. In an attempt to find out what had happened to Ephraim and Mira, he volunteered to be implanted with an [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]].<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\n===Escaping the Empire===\n{{Quote|The secrets in his head could help bring down the Empire.|Kanan Jarrus|Empire Day (episode)}}\n[[File:Tseebo.png|thumb|left|200px|Tseebo is found by the ''Ghost'' crew in the old Bridger home]]\nBy the time of the [[Empire Day|Empire's fifteenth anniversary]], Tseebo, at the age of 38,<ref name=\"SWR:VG:EB\" /> was carrying highly classified Imperial information including the schematics for new [[TIE line|TIE fighters]] and [[walker]]s, schedules for [[stormtrooper]] tactics and strategies, and a five [[Standard year|year]] plan for [[Lothal]] and every other world in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. He fled from the Imperial authorities and attempted to get the information off Lothal. Due to the highly sensitive nature of Tseebo's information, the Empire launched a planetwide manhunt in order to prevent Tseebo from falling into the hands of the rebellion.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\nWith nowhere else to go, Tseebo went into hiding in the former [[Bridger household]]. Later that night, he was found by Ezra, [[Kanan Jarrus]], and [[Sabine Wren]]; who were members of a rebel group known as the [[Spectres]]. Due to his resentment towards Tseebo for not helping his parents, Ezra refused to help him. However, Kanan and Sabine disagreed and decided to rescue Tseebo due to the valuable intelligence he was carrying. The rebels managed to hijack an [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]], outrun their Imperial pursuers, and reach Capital City's outskirts. There, they were airlifted to safety by their rebel comrades aboard the ''[[Ghost]]''; a modified [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which had become the Spectres' main base of operations.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\nAs the ''Ghost'' headed into space, Tseebo regained his senses and quickly recognized Ezra. Before he could speak to the boy, the ''Ghost'' came under fire from several TIE fighters led by [[the Grand Inquisitor]], the ship's [[captain]] [[Hera Syndulla]] called for Sabine to take the nose gun. When Sabine took an interest in Tseebo's knowledge of Ezra's parents, a resentful Ezra insisted that they were dead. After Sabine had left the room, Ezra questioned Tseebo about his parents' fate. Tseebo could only recount the day they were captured but could not ascertain their current whereabouts. He then lamented his failure to save the Bridgers. This only upset Ezra who refused to forgive Tseebo.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref>\n\n===Finding forgiveness===\n{{Quote|You seem&hellip;better.''\"<br />\"''Tseebo's mind is clearer now. But it is difficult. There's so much information inside Tseebo.''\"<br />\"''Fulcrum's people will help you with that and keep you safe.|Hera Syndulla and Tseebo, at peace and moving forward|Gathering Forces}}\nTseebo managed to help the rebels escape the Empire by transmitting [[hyperspace]] coordinates into the ''Ghost''{{'s}} [[hyperdrive]]. As the crew took a moment to catch their breath, Tseebo returned to his unresponsive state. As Ezra and the other rebels debate what to do about Tseebo, the Rodian suddenly projected a [[hologram]] revealing that the Imperials had managed to attach a [[XX-23 S-thread tracker|tracking device]] to the ''Ghost''. The ship's [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] then performed a scan which confirmed that the said tracking device was on the hull of the ''[[Phantom]]''.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nWhile Kanan and Ezra took the ''Phantom'' to [[Fort Anaxes]] to lure the Grand Inquisitor away from the ''Ghost'', Tseebo remained on the ''Ghost''. Hera had contacted the mysterious rebel leader known as [[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]] and arranged for Tseebo to go into hiding. During the journey, Tseebo later heard Ezra calling out to him through [[the Force]]; forgiving the Rodian for not standing by his parents. Though he could not respond back the same way, Tseebo expressed relief that he had been forgiven. As the ''Ghost'' rendezvoused with Fulcrum's [[CR90 corvette]], Tseebo told Hera that he knew about the fate of Ezra's parents. Before parting, Hera promised to share this information with Ezra when the time was right.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|At a guess, I'd say my former colleagues are coming after me. Can't have Imperial secrets falling into rebel hands. Can't have another Tseebo, or a Death Star ''incident''&hellip;|Everi Chalis| Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nSeveral months later, Tseebo's information proved useful when Ezra experienced a [[Force vision]] of his parents. Hera then revealed that Ezra's parents had been imprisoned within a vast network of Imperial prisons throughout the galaxy. Together with his master Kanan, Ezra then traveled back to the planet Lothal. There, they encountered [[Ryder Azadi]], the former [[Governor]] of Lothal and a friend of the Bridgers. He revealed that Ephraim and Mira had been so inspired by their son's involvement in the rebellion that they had staged an [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|escape attempt]] but were killed. Despite the loss of his parents, Ezra was able to make peace with his past and move on.<ref name=\"Legacy\">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>\n\nYears after Tseebo was spirited away by the Spectres, the incident was still fresh in the Imperials' minds. When [[Everi Chalis]], the governor of [[Haidoral Prime]], defected to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], she feared that the [[Imperial Ruling Council]] would hunt her down, stating that the Empire could not have another Tseebo.<ref name=\"BF\">''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The risk you Bridgers take, Tseebo say you must think of your son.|Tseebo's concern for Ephraim and Mira Bridger|Empire Day (episode)}}\nAs a Rodian, Tseebo had a humanoid form with large round eyes and a slender snout. He had yellow skin and green eyes. He also wore an AJ^6 cyborg construct which allowed him to store a vast amount of sensitive Imperial information. While Tseebo was a good friend of Ezra Bridger's parents Ephraim and Mira, he lacked the same courage and fortitude to challenge the Galactic Empire.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> Out of guilt of having failed to stand by them and to protect Ezra, Tseebo joined the Imperial Information Office and volunteered to be implanted with a cybernetic implant in order to find the Bridgers and to aid the rebellion against the Empire. While the cyborg implant enabled him to interact easily with technology, the sheer amount of information made him unfocused and confused.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTseebo first appeared as a secondary character in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episodes \"[[Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day]]\" and \"[[Gathering Forces]],\" which premiered on [[November 10]] and [[November 17]] [[2014]] respectively. He was voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]] in both episodes. He also appeared in [[Michael Kogge]]'s ''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]'', a chapter book which consisted of elements from the ''Rebels'' episodes \"Empire Day,\" \"Gathering Forces,\" and \"[[Path of the Jedi]].\" He was later referenced in [[Alexander Freed]]'s 2015 novel ''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars Rebels (webcomic)|''Star Wars Rebels'' webcomic]]\n*{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Path of the Jedi: A Star Wars Rebels Cinestory Comic]]''\n*{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}\n*''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]''\n*''[[Battle to the End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}} {{Voice}}\n*{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Battlefront: Twilight Company (audiobook)|''Battlefront: Twilight Company'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels-empire-day-episode-guide|text=\"Empire Day\" Episode Guide - ''Star Wars Rebels''}}\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels/gathering-forces-episode-guide|text=\"Gathering Forces\" Episode Guide - ''Star Wars Rebels''}}\n*[https://www.facebook.com/starwarsrebels/photos/a.230754950414469.1073741828.180356405454324/383778375112125/?type=1&theater Facebook ''Star Wars Rebels'' photo collection]\n*{{InsiderCite|155|Rebels, Animated}}\n*''[[Sabine My Rebel Sketchbook]]'' {{C|Sketch}}\n*{{InsiderCite|156|Star Wars Rebels Recounted|''Star Wars Rebels'' Recounted}}\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Rebel Power!]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|1|Databank A-Z|Ask Aak&ndash;Stass Allie}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|47|Helmets|Ezra Bridger}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|57|Databank A-Z|Trident Assault Ship&ndash;Turbolasers}}\n*''[[The Star Wars Book]]''\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|BB-8 and Other Astromech Droids}}\n*{{Databank|lobot-tech-headgear|Lobot-Tech Headgear|archivedate=20200220171405}}\n*{{Databank|the-ghost|The ''Ghost''|archivedate=20190910043231}}\n*{{Databank|tseebo|Tseebo|archivedate=20171110053051}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tseebo#kanon\n|es=Tseebo\n|ja=\u30b7\u30fc\u30dc\n|ka=\u10e2\u10e1\u10d8\u10d1\u10dd\n|nl=Tseebo\n|pl=Tseebo\n|pt=Tseebo\n|ru=\u0422\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Imperial Intelligence personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Lothalites]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
