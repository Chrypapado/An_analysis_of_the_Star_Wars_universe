A [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Dorja embraced the tenets of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] and took command of the ''Relentless'' prior to [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] between the Empire and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. [[Gender/Legends|He]] was known for a cautious command style that saw his [[Starship/Legends|ship]] suffer no [[Death/Legends|casualties]], and he held his [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] back from the main combat lines at 4 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY's]] [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], an engagement with the Rebels that saw the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] killed and the Empire splinter into [[Warlord/Legends|warlordism]]. Over the next five [[Standard year/Legends|years]], as [[Imperial Space]] was greatly diminished by the Alliance's successor state, the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Dorja plotted to seize control of the fleet from Captain [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]]. His plans were foiled, however, when the tactically gifted [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] returned from the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]] and was given control of the [[Thrawn's confederation|Empire]]. Dorja and the ''Relentless'' were put in command of the [[Thrawn's fleet (Galactic Empire)|navy's]] secondary force, and Dorja saw his exclusion from the Grand [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral's]] primary armada as a personal slight against himself.\n\nDuring [[Thrawn campaign|Thrawn's campaign]] against the New Republic, the ''Relentless'' came across several high-profile enemy targets on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[New Cov/Legends|New Cov]], and although they [[Raid on New Cov|escaped]] from the Star [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer]], Dorja captured the ship thief [[Niles Ferrier]] and presented him to Thrawn. Ferrier tracked down a number of [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|dreadnaughts]] for the Grand Admiral that proved to be a turning point in the campaign, but Thrawn was later [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|betrayed and killed]] by his [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] [[Rukh/Legends|Rukh]]. His campaign came to an end, and by [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]] Dorja was serving the [[Imperial Reunification|reorganized]] Imperial Remnant. When Pellaeon decided to sue for peace with the New Republic, his plans were sabotaged by a [[Sinister Triumvirate|group of treasonous Imperials]] who included a [[Con artist/Legends|con artist]] named [[Flim]]. Posing as a reborn Thrawn, Flim recruited Dorja to [[Mission to Morishim|capture]] [[Meizh Vermel|Pellaeon's courier]] before he could make any overtures to the New Republic. As Pellaeon waited in seclusion for peace talks that would not actually occur, Flim took to using the ''Relentless'' as his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] while \"Thrawn\" [[Caamas Document Crisis|expanded]] Imperial influence throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. When Dorja [[Space warfare|intercepted]] a covert [[Battle of Yaga Minor (Galactic Civil War)|New Republic strike]] at Imperial-held [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], Pellaeon suddenly walked onto the ship's [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] and brought the ruse to an end. [[Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty|Peace accords]] were signed with the New Republic, and in the following years, Dorja's daughter [[Vana Dorja|Vana]] became a [[Commander/Legends|commander]] in the Imperial [[Navy/Legends|Navy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Cautious command===\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] by the name of Dorja was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> in or before the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]]<ref name=\"Birth date\" /> to a wealthy [[Dorja family|family]]<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|200|Dorja, Captain}}</ref> with a long tradition of [[Republic Military/Legends|military]] service to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].

On several occasions, Dorja came close to taking action and seizing command of the Empire, but the rest of the fleet officers respected Pellaeon and believed that he was worth following. Nevertheless, Dorja was finally ready to make his move in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]],<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> when [[Imperial Space]] had been reduced to a quarter of its former size by the Alliance's successor, the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"EC\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref> However, his plans were halted by the return of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], a highly gifted tactician,<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> from the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Thrawn was given control of the Empire by its remaining [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]]<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> and by the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Ruling Council]]. He was also put in charge of the military forces of two warlord fiefdoms: the [[Pentastar Alignment]] and the [[Ciutric Hegemony]]. The Grand Admiral left an adequate reserve of ships to defend the Moffs at the Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Orinda/Legends|Orinda]], but he also took the twelve Star Destroyers remaining from the Battle of Endor. Thrawn formed a personal fleet from six of them and left the other six, including the ''Relentless'', as a secondary force under Dorja's command.<ref name=\"Warfare\" />\n\n[[File:Dorjasprisoner.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dorja presents the prisoner Niles Ferrier to Grand Admiral Thrawn.]]\nDorja saw the exclusion of the ''Relentless'' from Thrawn's primary armada as a personal slight against himself. He was also unhappy that a [[Alien/Legends|non-Human]] such as Thrawn was in [[Thrawn's confederation|command]] of the Empire, but he kept his head low and his opinion private, waiting for the opportunity to seize control.<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> Thrawn spent six [[Standard month/Legends|months]] reorganizing the [[Thrawn's fleet (Galactic Empire)|fleet]] and performing strategic raids along the Imperial&ndash;New Republic border before stepping up his [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]].<ref name=\"EC\" /> During the campaign, the ''Relentless'' was sent to the planet [[New Cov/Legends|New Cov]] on a regular [[Raid on New Cov|tax collection raid]], but the Imperials discovered two noteworthy ships docked in the planet's capital [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Ilic]]: the [[Lady Luck/Legends|''Lady Luck'']], a [[Personal Luxury Yacht 3000|yacht]] belonging to former New Republic [[General/Legends|General]] [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], and the [[AA-589|personal X-wing fighter]] of the New Republic [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Several [[Dropship/Legends|dropships]] containing [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and [[Imperial Army trooper/Legends|army troopers]] were sent to the surface to search for the high-profile enemies of the Empire, and when Skywalker, Calrissian, and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]&mdash;a famous New Republic captain&mdash;escaped from the planet, Dorja pursued and dispatched [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]]. The sudden arrival of three [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|dreadnaughts]] from [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] turned the tide of the battle, as the newcomers hit the ''Relentless'' with an [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]] barrage before escaping along with the New Republic team.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" />\n\nOn New Cov's surface, Dorja's [[Troop/Legends|troops]] arrested the ship thief [[Niles Ferrier]] for attempting to steal a load of [[biomolecule]]s. Soon afterward, Thrawn contacted the ''Relentless'' and asked to speak to the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]], and Dorja brought the shackled Ferrier to a [[Holocomm/Legends|holocomm]] unit and called the Grand Admiral back. After making a point to remind Dorja that he had let Solo, Skywalker, and Calrissian escape, Thrawn instructed Ferrier to track down the [[dreadnaught]]s that had attacked the ''Relentless'' at New Cov. He then told Dorja to provide Ferrier with an unmarked [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] as a means of completing the task and ended the call. The dreadnaughts in fact belonged to the legendary [[Katana fleet|''Katana'' fleet]], and when Ferrier uncovered the armada's location,<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" /> Thrawn [[Battle for the Katana fleet|acquired]] 178 of the fabled [[Warship/Legends|warships]]. With his own fleet greatly bolstered, the Grand Admiral changed tactics and began to attack and reclaim territory from the New Republic.<ref name=\"Warfare\" />\n\nThrawn took the ''Chimaera'' to [[Battle at Ukio|capture]] the planet [[Ukio/Legends|Ukio]] while other Star Destroyer captains of the fleet, including Dorja, were sent to make feints at various other targets in order to draw away the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]]. Dorja spoke to Thrawn and Pellaeon via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] while en route to his target and was given the command to strike. Not long after the successful operation, when the ''Chimaera'' was at the [[Bilbringi Shipyards]], Pellaeon contacted Dorja and requested a 500-man caretaker crew for the following six hours. The request came after the insane [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Joruus C'baoth]]&mdash;whom Thrawn had recruited to aid with his campaign&mdash;used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to take control of the minds of everyone on the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] in a display of power to the Grand Admiral, and left the men limp and exhausted.<ref name=\"The Last Command\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> Thrawn was later betrayed and killed by his [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] [[Rukh/Legends|Rukh]] during a [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|battle]] at [[Bilbringi system|Bilbringi]], and his campaign was brought to an end.<ref name=\"Warfare\" />\n\n===The Empire's last gasp===\n{{Quote|And if I may, sir, I'd like to echo Captain Nalgol's sentiments.

The Star Destroyer fell within the [[Braxant Sector Fleet]], which was under the direct command of Moff [[Vilim Disra]],<ref name=\"Specter\" /> but it was also one of the primary ships that Pellaeon used to patrol Imperial [[Realspace/Legends|Space]].<ref name=\"CSWE Relentless\">{{CSWECite|III|91|Relentless}}</ref> Dorja's stances toward both Pellaeon and Thrawn had changed radically in the intervening [[Standard decade/Legends|decade]]&mdash;by 19 ABY, he trusted Pellaeon's word and judgment<ref name=\"Vision\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref> and considered it an honor to have served under Thrawn.<ref name=\"Specter\" />\n\n[[File:Flim.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Flim, the man whom Dorja believed to be Thrawn]]\nWith the Remnant having been pushed back to just eight backwater [[Sector/Legends|sectors]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], Pellaeon realized that the war was lost< and decided to sue for peace with the New Republic. Although he convinced the Remnant's ruling [[Council of Moffs]] to support his plan, the [[Sinister Triumvirate]] of Moff Disra, former [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]] [[Grodin Tierce (clone)|Grodin Tierce]], and the [[Con artist/Legends|con artist]] [[Flim]]&mdash;the latter of whom was posing as a reborn Grand Admiral Thrawn&mdash;set into motion a plot to thwart Pellaeon's plans and seize control of the Remnant. Disra summoned Dorja and three other Star Destroyer captains to his [[Disra's palace|palace]] on the Remnant's capital world, [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], and in his office, he gave them each a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] full of instructions. Captain [[Trazzen]] of the ''[[Obliterator]]'' and Captain [[Argona]] of the [[Ironhand (Imperial-class)|''Ironhand'']] felt that removing four Star Destroyers from the [[Braxant sector|sector]] fleet for any length of time was a poor tactical move, while both Dorja and Captain [[Nalgol]] of the ''[[Tyrannic]]'' questioned Disra's authority to send them to [[Morishim]] and [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]]&mdash;planets outside of his sector.<ref name=\"Specter\" />\n\nDisra indicated that he would thus choose other captains to take part in a \"history-making military campaign,\" but Flim, dressed as Thrawn, walked into the office and stated that he had chosen the four present captains for a reason. The four stunned captains quickly recovered themselves and stood at attention, and the man they believed to be Thrawn told them that for the time being, he could not answer any questions about how he had survived. The captains pledged themselves to his leadership and agreed to keep his survival a secret. Dorja asked no questions about the [[Courier/Legends|courier]] that he had been assigned to intercept at Morishim, and he told the Grand Admiral how pleased he was to again serve under his command. Although Disra feared that Dorja would see through the fa\u00e7ade, [[Major/Legends|Major]] Tierce believed the ruse would only work if they could fool someone who had served directly under Thrawn in the past. After the captains departed, Dorja vouched for Thrawn's military genius to a still-skeptical Nalgol.<ref name=\"Specter\" />\n\nWhen the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] of [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Meizh Vermel]], Pellaeon's peace messenger to the New Republic, arrived at Morishim, the ''Relentless'' dropped out of hyperspace right behind it and began to [[Mission to Morishim|fire]] on its target. Vermel's attempts to transmit an offer of parley to New Republic General [[Garm Bel Iblis]] were [[Jammer|jammed]] by Dorja. Lando Calrissian and the New Republic's [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] were in-[[Morishim system|system]] at the time, however, and managed to dilute the jamming enough to receive a garbled, nonsensical recording of Vermel's message. The [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] was then brought aboard the ''Relentless'' via [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], and the Star Destroyer jumped to [[Lightspeed/Legends|lightspeed]] to return to Bastion. Dorja contacted Flim, who reprimanded him for allowing even a fragment of Vermel's recording to reach New Republic [[Ear/Legends|ears]]. He then interrogated the corvette's crew, who had no inkling of what Vermel and Pellaeon were up to.<ref name=\"Specter\" /> Vermel was eventually taken to a [[Prison/Legends|holding cell]] at the Remnant's [[Rimcee Station]].<ref name=\"Vision\" />\n\nWhen the Triumvirate was ready to reveal \"Thrawn\" to the New Republic, Dorja took Flim and Tierce in the ''Relentless'' to an area of deep space and used an interdictor cruiser to intercept the ''Lady Luck'' from hyperspace. The Triumvirate had caught wind that Calrissian was giving New Republic [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Porolo Miatamia]] a ride from [[Cilpar]] to Coruscant, and the two were brought aboard the ''Relentless'' to speak with the Grand Admiral. The New Republic was dealing with a major [[Caamas Document Crisis|internal crisis]] following the discovery of a partial copy of the [[Caamas Document]], a [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] which revealed that several [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] were responsible for the long-ago [[Caamas Firestorm|destruction of Caamas]], and Flim told his guests that he was willing to personally sit down with the [[Clan|Bothan clan leaders]] and discern specifically whom was responsible. His offer caused major [[Politics/Legends|political]] infighting in the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]], serving the Triumvirate's aim to bring about the collapse of the New Republic from within.<ref name=\"Specter\" />\n\n===A ruse revealed===\n{{Dialogue|Pellaeon|Captain Dorja, call a medical team to the bridge. Then order all Imperial forces to cease fire immediately.|Dorja|Yes, sir.

General Bel Iblis, please call on your forces to do likewise, then stand by for a transmission from Admiral Pellaeon.|attr=The end of the Galactic Civil War|src=Vision of the Future}}\nWhile Pellaeon waited for Bel Iblis in the [[Pesitiin system]], with the ''Chimaera'' blind and out of contact with the rest of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], the Triumvirate took to using the ''Relentless'' as their flagship. Dorja ferried them to the planet [[Kroctar]], deep in New Republic territory, where the [[Kroctari]] [[Lord Superior]] [[Bosmihi]] contacted the ''Relentless''{{'s}} bridge and asked \"Thrawn\" for readmission into the Remnant. A Kroctari delegation arrived aboard the Star Destroyer, and under Flim's orders, Dorja personally met them and escorted them to a conference room. The ship's next stop was the planet [[Ruuria/Legends|Ruuria]], where Dorja met with the [[Ruurian/Legends|Ruurian]] [[Ambassador/Legends|ambassador]] [[Amisus]], who was also interested in switching sides. After the ambassador's [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] left the ''Relentless'', eight [[Marauder-class corvette|''Marauder''-class corvettes]] jumped into the system and attacked. From the secondary command room, Flim instructed Dorja to launch six [[Preybird-class starfighter|''Preybird''-class starfighters]] to intercept, and Disra quickly realized that the attackers were [[Diamal]]an, enemies of the Ruurians. Flim took credit for the discovery and had the ''Relentless'' execute a [[Tron Boral maneuver]], followed by the Preybirds doing a full-closure [[Marg Sabl/Legends|Marg Sabl]] sweep&mdash;the pair of maneuvers had been used to great effect by the real Thrawn in a previous battle with the Diamala, and as such, the corvettes fled without any shots having been fired. Dorja informed the Ruurians that an attack on their world had been averted, and then took the ''Relentless'' back to Bastion. The [[Unified Ruurian Colonies]] later pledged themselves to the Remnant.<ref name=\"Vision\" />\n\n[[File:Dorja_comic.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Captain Dorja]]\nWhile on the Imperial capital, the Triumvirate learned that General Bel Iblis was planning a strike at the Imperial [[Ubiqtorate/Legends|Ubiqtorate]] [[Ubiqtorate (station)|station]] at the world of [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], in search of a full copy of the Caamas Document that he hoped would save the New Republic from descending into civil war. Dorja took them there in the ''Relentless'' so that they could provide a demonstration of \"Thrawn's\" tactical genius to the [[Mistryl Shadow Guard]]s, a group of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] whom they hoped would ally with the Remnant. At the Ubiqtorate [[Space station/Legends|station]], Dorja contacted Thrawn in the secondary command room and notified him that the ''Tyrannic'' was approaching the base. Since the ''Tyrannic'' was actually away on [[Battle of Bothawui (Galactic Civil War)|another mission]], the Triumvirate knew that it was Bel Iblis's [[Errant Venture|Star Destroyer]] with false [[transponder code]]s; Dorja accordingly told the base's General [[Hestiv]] to allow the warship to pass the station's outer perimeter before putting all defenses at readiness for battle. On Flim's order, Dorja also placed the ''Relentless'' between the station and the incoming Destroyer. The false ''Tyrannic'' was caught in a number of the station's tractor beams and began firing on them, and Bel Iblis's task force, hanging back from the station, emerged from hiding and began to [[Battle of Yaga Minor (Galactic Civil War)|attack]]. During the battle, the [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] [[Talon Karrde]] arrived in his [[Action VI transport|starship]], the ''[[Wild Karrde]]'', with what he claimed was the ultimate bargaining chip, and Rogue Squadron escorted him through the battle lines toward the ''Relentless''.<ref name=\"Vision\" />\n\nThe Triumvirate and the Shadow Guards made their way to the bridge, where everyone present was shocked when Pellaeon arrived shortly afterward. Karrde had uncovered a datacard revealing the Triumvirate's ruse and had brought the information to Pellaeon, and, on the ''Relentless''{{'s}} bridge, the Supreme [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] brought the lie to an end. Dorja protested that Nalgol had performed a positive [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] test from one of Thrawn's skin samples, but Pellaeon countered that records could be altered. Tierce tried to appeal to Dorja, claiming that Pellaeon was jealous that Thrawn had spurned him in favor of Dorja, but Pellaeon revealed the final card up his sleeve: Tierce was a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] of the [[Grodin Tierce|original Grodin Tierce]] and existed as a failed genetic experiment of Thrawn's. Karrde's associate [[Shada D'ukal]] killed the furious Tierce before he could attack Pellaeon, and the Supreme Commander told Dorja to call a medical team to the bridge. Pellaeon also told him to order all Imperial forces to cease their fire against the New Republic, but Dorja pointed out that they would expect the order to come from Thrawn. Pellaeon agreed, and Flim, in fact glad that the ruse was finally over, also obliged.<ref name=\"Vision\" />\n\nWith their plans having fallen to dust, Flim and Disra were escorted off the bridge by a security team. The Mistryl Shadow Guards also disappeared back into the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. Concurrently with the battle at Yaga Minor, Luke Skywalker [[Mission to Nirauan|found a full copy]] of the Caamas Document on the planet [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]], which averted a civil war. Fifteen days later, Pellaeon signed [[Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty|peace accords]] with the New Republic's [[President of the Senate|President]] [[Ponc Gavrisom|Gavrisom]], and the Galactic Civil War was finally brought to an end.<ref name=\"Vision\" /> By [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Dorja's daughter, Vana,<ref name=\"CSWE Vana\" /> had become a commander in the Imperial [[Navy/Legends|Navy]].<ref name=\"Destiny's Way chapter 1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Admiral, I've always trusted your word and your judgment. But in this case&hellip;|Dorja, to Admiral Pellaeon, while torn between trusting the admiral or the man he believes to be Thrawn|Vision of the Future}}\nDorja embraced the thrill of command, the call of space, and the tenets of the New Order when he joined the Imperial Navy. Doing so also ensured that he followed his family's long tradition of military service. As the captain of the ''Relentless'', he became known for a cautious command style and a reluctance to engage an enemy in direct combat; his tactics came under fire from others, but he dismissed their criticisms, albeit nervously. On paper, his prudence was not misplaced;<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> the ''Relentless'' suffered no casualties under his command<ref name=\"Rebellion\" /> up to and including the Battle of Endor, although he was removed from that engagement's main battle lines. Dorja was loathe to follow the orders of a junior officer when Captain Pellaeon ordered a retreat from Endor, but he agreed that the battle was hopeless. For the next five years, Dorja plotted to seize control of the Imperial fleet from Pellaeon.<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" />\n\n[[File:Sheep.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dorja acknowledges an order from Thrawn.]]\nAlthough his carefully laid plans were foiled by the return of Thrawn, Dorja was disgusted that a [[Non-huMan|non-Human]] was controlling the Empire and continued to plot to wrest power. By replacing Thrawn, Dorja believed that he could reinstate an undiluted, glorious New Order, something he felt the Emperor would have wanted. Dorja was offended when Thrawn left the ''Relentless'' out of his primary armada, but the captain kept his opinions to himself, knowing that the Grand Admiral was unforgiving toward insubordination.<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> He was uncomfortable and openly winced when Thrawn took care to remind him that he had let Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and Luke Skywalker escape from New Cov.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" />\n\nToward the end of the Thrawn campaign, Dorja was eager to go into battle during the Grand Admiral's capture of Ukio, cupping his right fist in his left in an ancient [[Mirshaf]] victory gesture as he acknowledged an order from Thrawn.<ref name=\"The Last Command\" /> Ten years after Thrawn's death, Dorja's attitude toward him had shifted considerably&mdash;he considered it an honor to have served under the Grand Admiral, and he espoused the quality of Thrawn's character and of his military genius to a skeptical Captain Nalgol. When Dorja believed that Thrawn had returned, he followed the Grand Admiral's orders unquestioningly,<ref name=\"Specter\" /> even if they puzzled him. He had complete faith in Thrawn and was thus calm when the ''Relentless'' came under attack, and he visibly beamed when Flim, posing as Thrawn, complimented his leadership ability.<ref name=\"Specter\" />\n\nDorja's attitude toward Pellaeon had also turned around by 19 ABY, at which time he trusted the Supreme Commander's judgment and his word. When Pellaeon accused \"Thrawn\" of being a con artist in disguise, Dorja was torn between whom to believe.<ref name=\"Vision\" /> Dorja was less respectful toward Moff Disra, in whose sector fleet he served, questioning his authority to conduct operations outside of the Braxant sector and treating such orders as requests rather than commands.<ref name=\"Specter\" /> When Disra, on the bridge of the ''Relentless'', was shocked that the Kroctari wanted to join the Imperial Remnant, Dorja gave the Moff a tightly satisfied smile.<ref name=\"Vision\" /> Dorja had light skin, [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and gray [[Hair/Legends|hair]],<ref name=\"Rebellion\" /> and he stood 1.8 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall.<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCaptain Dorja was created by author [[Timothy Zahn]] as a minor character in the [[1992]] novel ''[[Dark Force Rising]]'',<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" /> the second book in what would later be known as [[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy|''The Thrawn Trilogy'']].<ref name=\"Reader's Companion Thrawn Trilogy\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' {{C|The Thrawn Trilogy}}</ref> In [[1993]], he appeared in the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[The Last Command]]'',<ref name=\"The Last Command\" /> and his character was fleshed out in [[Bill Slavicsek]]'s ''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''.<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> Dorja was later used in a larger role in Zahn's [[1997]] and [[1998]] books, ''[[Specter of the Past]]'' and ''[[Vision of the Future]]'',<ref name=\"Specter\" /><ref name=\"Vision\" /> two novels that make up [[Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn Duology|''The Hand of Thrawn'' Duology]].<ref name=\"Reader's Companion Hand of Thrawn\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> He has since been mentioned in several ''[[Star Wars]]'' reference works,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /><ref name=\"Warfare\" /> and visual depictions of Dorja have appeared in the 1998 [[video game]] [[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]<ref name=\"Rebellion\" /> and in the [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] adaptations of [[Dark Force Rising (comics)|''Dark Force Rising'']] and [[The Last Command (comics)|''The Last Command'']].<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising comic\">[[Dark Force Rising 3|''Dark Force Rising''

tells the game's players that Dorja \"makes a nearly perfect admiral, and you can trust him with difficult battles.\"<ref name=\"Rebellion game guide\">''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough the ''Dark Force Rising Sourcebook'' establishes that Dorja hates and plots to seize power from both Grand Admiral Thrawn and Captain Pellaeon,<ref name=\"DFR Sourcebook\" /> ''The Hand of Thrawn'' Duology presents him as extremely loyal to both of them.<ref name=\"Specter\" /><ref name=\"Vision\" /> As ten years separate the events of the duology from those of the Thrawn Trilogy,<ref name=\"Reader's Companion Thrawn Trilogy\" /><ref name=\"Reader's Companion Hand of Thrawn\" /> this article treats the discrepancy as Dorja having changed his attitude in the intervening time period.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Dorja}}\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{1st}}
