It appeared that Tolut was slightly [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], however he was never considered for training in the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Tolut was loud-mouthed and impatient, but he knew when he was beaten.\n\nTolut scoffed at the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], considering them to be dishonorable and considering the power of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] a simple trick anyone could perform, as seen when he used his own mild Force-ability to levitate a glass of [[Water/Legends|water]] slightly off the table.

He soon accepted his defeat.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Approaching Storm]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Approaching Storm (audiobook)|''The Approaching Storm'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tolut\n|pl=Tolut\n}}\n\n[[Category:Ansion residents|Tolut]]\n[[Category:Armalat|Tolut]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives|Tolut]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors|Tolut]]\n[[Category:Males|Tolut]]"}}}]}}}}
