It was the most successful mechanic's shop in the area, a claim that failed to be hindered by Monarg's record of drunken rampages that would see him locked up in a local [[Prisoner/Legends|prison]] for one night. Wearing an eye patch over one eye, Monarg was a recognizable figure who was in very good favor with local authorities. When the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Vestara Khai]] landed on Dathomir, she sold her [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub]] [[StarTripper]] [[Yacht/Legends|Yacht]], called ''[[She's a Chancer]]'', to Monarg in exchange for enough [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to send a [[Hypercomm/Legends|hypercomm]] message to her [[Lost Tribe of Sith|Sith allies]] on [[Kesh]]. Monarg then spent a tremendous amount of credits repairing and refurbishing the yacht, neglecting to file claim documents with the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] in the process. The [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] soon after infiltrated Monarg's shop, but was discovered by the mechanic and fitted with a [[Restraining bolt/Legends|restraining bolt]].<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref>\n\nOne of R2-D2's masters, the female [[Allana Solo]], soon arrived at Monarg's Mechanic Works to rescue her wayward droid, lighting a lubricant barrel on fire outside of the shop in order to distract Monarg and sneak in. After Monarg neutralized the flames with a [[Fire extinguisher/Legends|fire extinguisher]], he discovered Solo's presence in his shop, and lifted her off the ground while simultaneously stunning her pet [[Nexu/Legends|Nexu]] [[Anji]] by throwing the creature onto the ground. He was then blinded by a cup of [[Caf/Legends|caf]] thrown into his eyes, and after blindly fumbling around his shop, found Solo again and once again picked her up. He was then accosted by Solo's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], who entered the shop and claimed to be downloading a comprehensive package of combat maneuvers. Monarg engaged the droid in combat and easily dominated him, failing to realize that the ploy was a distraction on C-3PO's part; the protocol droid had sent a wake-up command to R2-D2, who approached Monarg and electrocuted his buttocks with his [[Arc welder/Legends|arc welder]]. Solo, the Nexu, and the droids quickly escaped, but Monarg gathered several broad-shouldered friends and followed the group to their [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. Monarg attempted to gain access with a [[Cutting torch/Legends|cutting torch]], but the tool was destroyed via a use of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Zekk]], who was secretly watching over Solo, as the ''Falcon'' flew off.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nSeveral days later, Monarg was visited in his shop by [[Tarth Vames]], the deputy director of operations of the spaceport, who brought with him Khai, as well as the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], his son [[Ben Skywalker|Ben]], and the [[Skywalker family/Legends|Skywalkers']] companion [[Dyon Stadd]]. As Monarg had not filed any claim documents for the SoruSuub yacht, Vames seized it and gave it to the Skywalkers.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]'' {{1st|''Fate of the Jedi: Backlash'' audiobook}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Backlash'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|132|Apocalypse...
