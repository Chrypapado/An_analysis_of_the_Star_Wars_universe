Though it's probably still well hidden.|Strilath Farles, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nStrilath Farles was a lieutenant in the [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]], a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] band of anti-technology thugs. After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he was leading a group of Meatlumps [[Meatlump Camps|based]] on the planet [[Talus/Legends|Talus]]. Farles had relocated from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to Talus since he was engaged in a violent conflict with a group of [[Ragtags|Ragtag]] criminals led by [[Gramo Murah]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" />\n\nAround [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the Meatlumps on Talus attacked [[Sul Prine]]'s [[Sul Prine's Place|house]] near the city of [[Dearic]] and smashed several [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bikes]]. When [[Vani Korr]], a ''[[Corellia Times]]'' [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]] who was investigating the Meatlumps, learned of this attack, she tasked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to investigate. The spacer met Sul Prine and then used a map lost by one of the Meatlumps during the attack to localize their camp. The adventurer attacked the camp, killing some Meatlumps in the process, and forced the others to reveal the identity of their leader: Strilath Farles.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" />\n\nIn the meantime, Strilath Farles was on Corellia.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" /> The man had traveled to the city of [[Doaba Guerfel/Legends|Doaba Guerfel]] in order to search the [[Meatlump Hideout]]; as he did not manage to remember its location.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP4\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 4|Corellia}}</ref> Also looking for the Meatlump Hideout, the spacer confronted Strilath Farles in Doaba Guerfel. Defeated, the criminal accepted to exchange information with the spacer if the latter accepted to rid him of some Ragtags.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" /> The spacer thus attacked the [[Ragtag Base]] in the [[Nomad Mountains]] and killed Gramo Murah and his goons. When the spacer returned to Doaba Guerfel, Strilath Farles still ignored the location of the Meatlump Hideout and preferred to flee rather than suffering the wrath of the spacer.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nStrilath Farles appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Strilath Farles was added to the game with the update dubbed \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Meatlumps Hideout}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farles, Strilath}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Meatlumps]]"}}}]}}}}
