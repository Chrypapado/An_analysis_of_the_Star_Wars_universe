Barbo suggested that Jinn talk to [[D'zor]], a resident outlaw who, along with his thugs, camped outside Barbo's shop. He allowed Jinn access to the back of his shop, a move that put the Jedi's life at risk when D'Zor and his thugs attacked Jinn, who was forced to kill them in self-defense as well as destroy a [[Repeating blaster/Legends|repeating blaster]] that D'zor kept for protection. Jinn then took the fuel converter.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBarbo appears in [[1999]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]], where he was voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. The player, in the guise of Jinn, may interact with Barbo in the town to acquire parts. This article assumes that the player did so. The player also has the option of using a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] on Barbo to acquire a part, and although Barbo acts as if he is agreeing to it, the game prevents him from following through.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Barbo\n|nl=Barbo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gran]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
