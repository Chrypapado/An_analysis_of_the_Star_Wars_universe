I was on a bad path, and Chewie, he put me straight. Saved my shanks more than once too.|Han Solo, on Chewbacca|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Chewbacca''', known affectionately to his friends as '''Chewie''', was a [[Wookiee]] [[Gender|male]] [[Soldier|warrior]], [[smuggler]], [[technician|mechanic]], [[pilot]], and resistance fighter who fought in the [[Clone Wars]], the [[Galactic Civil War]], and the [[Cold War]] and subsequent [[First Order-Resistance War]]. He hailed from the [[planet]] [[Kashyyyk]] and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by [[Trandoshan]] [[Slavery|slavers]] and held captive on [[Wasskah]], but he worked with a fellow captive, [[Jedi Commander]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces of the [[Kachirho Wookiee Militia]] during the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]] alongside the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], led by [[Jedi General]] [[Yoda]]. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's [[clone trooper]]s received [[Order 66]] from [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee [[Chief]]tain and [[General]] [[Tarfful]], Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the [[Great Jedi Purge|destruction]] of the [[Jedi Order]].\n\nIn the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, during the [[Imperial Era|rule]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Chewbacca  was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] and became his co-pilot aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Together, they assisted [[Tobias Beckett]] and [[Qi'ra]] in a [[coaxium]] run for [[Crimson Dawn]]. They later worked in the employ of [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]] until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of [[spice]] to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a [[bounty]] was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to ferry him, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] to [[Alderaan]] on a mission vital to the survival of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. After finding Alderaan was [[The Disaster|destroyed]], the group was brought aboard the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], where they helped [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] [[Rescue of Princess Leia|escape]] from captivity and return to the [[Great Temple|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]]. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the [[Battle of Yavin]] and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.\n\nThroughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an [[Assault on Cymoon|assault]] on [[Cymoon 1]] and the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|battle]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from [[Echo Base]] on the planet [[Hoth]] after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], an old friend of Solo's, on [[Cloud City]], but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor's]] chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by [[Boba Fett]] to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in [[Jabba's Palace]] on [[Tatooine]], where Chewbacca and his friends [[Rescue of Han Solo|saved]] Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the [[Battle of Endor]], where Chewbacca helped destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] and allowed the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]]. The Emperor was killed for the first time aboard the [[battle station]], delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.\n\nAfter Endor and the rise of the [[New Republic]], Chewbacca and Solo fought to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberate]] Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his [[Chewbacca's family|family]]. After Solo's son [[Ben Solo|Ben]], turned to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] and [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed]] Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the ''Millennium Falcon'' and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the ''[[Eravana]]'', but they eventually found the ''Falcon'' and, with it, stowaways named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], [[Finn]], and the droid [[BB-8]]. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assault]] to destroy [[Starkiller Base]], a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet [[Ahch-To]] on the ''Falcon'', where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the ''Falcon'', including piloting the ship to aid the [[Resistance]] during the [[Battle of Crait]].\n\nRoughly [[35 ABY|a year after]] the battle of Crait, Chewbacca was one of the last of the Resistance. Having learned of the mysterious return of the Emperor, Chewbacca and the crew of the ''Falcon'', now including Poe Dameron, traveled to the planets [[Pasaana]] and [[Kijimi]] to find a clue to how to find [[Exegol|where the Emperor was hiding]], being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Chewbacca's death, as Rey, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Kylo Ren and destroyed a First Order transport that she had thought Chewbacca had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.\n\nHowever, Chewbacca survived and was rescued by the Resistance as they continued the quest. Rey eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Sith, and led the charge during [[Battle of Exegol|the battle that ensued later on]]. Rey ultimately killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned [[Ben Solo]] in the climax of the battle, while the Resistance, joined by the [[Citizens' Fleet]], progressively overpowered the [[Final Order|Sith fleet]] that the Emperor planned to unleash.\n\nHaving destroyed the Sith once and for all, the Resistance reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Hey, you're the married one.

The group were hired by [[Crimson Dawn]] to steal a train car of refined [[coaxium]] on [[Vandor]]. However, they failed due to the intervention of [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]], and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Chewbacca promised [[Dryden Vos]] of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious [[Kessel Run]]. Vos sent [[Qi'ra]], who had become his top lieutenant, with them.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\nKnowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. Solo played Calrissian in a game of \"[[Corellian Spike]]\" [[sabacc]], with the stakes being Calrissian's [[YT-1300 light freighter]], the [[Millennium Falcon]]. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n====The Kessel Run====\nChewbacca, Solo, Qi'ra, Calrissian, and Beckett stole the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian's navigational droid, [[L3-37]]. During the escape, Solo flew the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium [[fuel]] as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on [[Savareen]] in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called [[the Maw]], reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n====Savareen====\n{{Quote|Big stuff, you're coming with me.|Tobias Beckett commandeers Chewbacca|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:Beckett_and_Chewie.png|thumb|right|212x212px|Beckett takes Chewbacca captive.]]\nUpon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew was confronted by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\nHowever, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Chewbacca as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Chewbacca were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' [[First Light|yacht]] to meet Crimson Dawn leader [[Maul|Darth Maul]].

Han pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the ''Falcon'', jumping into the water below. Solo and Chewbacca left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.<ref name=\"Adventures 11\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=11|story=[[Powered Down, Part II]]}}</ref>\n\n====Mission to Ushruu====\n=====False pretenses=====\nAt one point, while on Coruscant after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by [[Alinka Aloo]], the daughter of [[Sim Aloo]]. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her [[Alinka Aloo's tower|tower]]. A [[Standard week|week]] later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a [[tooka]]-sitting job for Chewbacca, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Chewbacca went on a cargo ship with the [[librarian]] [[Mayvlin Trillick]]. But the ship, on [[autopilot]], pulled them into [[hyperspace]]. During the unwilling flight, Chewbacca and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet [[Ushruu]]. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo prisoner, and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Chewbaccca continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Chewbacca about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo droid, K-2SB, who was actually [[K-2SO]] on an undercover mission for [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]]. Eventually, the ship pulled out of hyperspace.<ref name=\"Mighty Chewbacca\">''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>\n\n=====Acquiring the artifact=====\nWhen they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by [[Janus Greejatus]]. Trillick and Chewbacca proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an [[antigrav crate]] with supplies, including a [[Medpac|medkit]], and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several [[Corellian hound]]s, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the [[tree]]s, but were attacked by a [[tongue]] of the [[Vathyr]], the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Chewbacca managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient [[book]] of [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the [[Enchantress]], spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]].<ref name=\"Mighty Chewbacca\" />\n\n=====Saving Han=====\nK-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Chewbacca and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Chewbacca came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to Coruscant. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Corellian [[Dog|hounds]] that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the ''Falcon'', and fought many [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] to escape Coruscant. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of [[Oktaro]].<ref name=\"Mighty Chewbacca\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Death Star rescue====\n{{Quotetrans|It's okay to care about them.

Arriving at [[Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine]] to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]]. At the bar, Chewbacca was approached by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]], who was searching for passage for himself, [[Luke Skywalker]] and the [[droid]]s [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to [[Alderaan]]. Promised 2,000 [[credit]]s in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Alderaan, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to the commission.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nIn [[Docking Bay 94]], Solo and Chewbacca found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired help.<ref name=\"Added Muscle\" /> One of them, the famous bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], kept an [[eye]] on Chewbacca, noting the Wookiee getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba.

C-3PO advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Chewbacca, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, prompting the two droids to surrender.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor_Aphra_11_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|right|200px|Chewbacca, pretending to be an Imperial prisoner.]]\nUpon the ''Falcon''{{'s}} exit from hyperspace, the group found themselves in a [[Asteroid|meteor]] storm produced by the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of the planet by the Imperial [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]. The group were soon caught by the [[tractor beam]] of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by R2-D2 that [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] was being held in [[Detention Block AA-23]], her [[Death|execution]] scheduled. They set out to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue]] her, with Chewbacca posing as a prisoner of [[stormtrooper]]-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Chewbacca and the others managed to escape from the Death Star\u2014except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with [[Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Vader]].

Though Chewbacca growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Rebel Alliance on its own to deal with the Death Star. They would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin from Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1]], allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive [[battle station]] by firing a [[proton torpedo]] into its exhaust port.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Medals.png|thumb|left|247x247px|Chewbacca lets out a triumphant howl after Skywalker and Solo are awarded medals.]]\nBack on Yavin 4, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were both awarded [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] by Organa, while Chewbacca howled in delight during the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Alderaan was destroyed, whereas General [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]] announced their need to [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuate]] Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location.<ref name=\"PL1\">[[Princess Leia 1|''Princess Leia'' 1]]</ref> Chewbacca would be also awarded a medal,<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" /><ref name=\"anh-PSFB\" /> and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.<ref name=\"PL1\" />\n\n====Cyrkon====\n{{Quote|You two play fast and loose.''\"<br />\"''It's worked so far.|Caluan Ematt, on Chewbacca and Han Solo's tactics|Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo & Chewbacca Adventure}}\nHowever, before they could depart for Tatooine to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Chewbacca convinced him to accept\u2014to rescue [[Lieutenant]] [[Caluan Ematt]] from [[Cyrkon]]. On the ''Falcon'', the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the ''[[Vehement]]'', which they avoided with a false [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], and landed in [[Motok]]. There, they were immediately attacked by [[Captivator's crew|some]] of Jabba's bounty hunters, including [[Captivator (droid)|Captivator]], which prompted Solo to accuse them of being \"Rebels\" and set them against [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]]'s garrison.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\nChewbacca slipped away with Solo to the [[Serendipity|''Miss Fortune'']] [[cantina]], where they found their old friend [[Delia Leighton]], to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Chewbacca and Solo rented a [[V-40]] and went into a [[hotel]], where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save [[Curtis]]'s life. However, they escaped and made their way to the ''Falcon'', only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\n[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|right|221x221px|Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt confronted by Alecia Beck.]]\nForced to surrender, Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Chewbacca and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo noticed the ''Miss Fortune'' making their way to save them, but with the [[magnetic field]] activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Chewbacca pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his [[E-11 blaster rifle]] and destroy the field generators, flooding the [[hangar]] with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the ''Miss Fortune'' opened fire at the Imperials, and Chewbacca made his way to the ''Falcon'' to start the [[engine]]s while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\nSoon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the ''Miss Fortune'', they found themselves against the ''Vehement'' and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the [[starfighter]]s, defeating several of them, until the ''Miss Fortune''{{'s}} took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Chewbacca saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the [[1550-LEX space yacht]] to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the ''Vehement''{{'s}} tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's [[atmosphere]] themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the ''Falcon'' at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the ''Falcon'' began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\n====Andelm IV====\nSometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the [[flight stabilizer]] of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on [[Andelm IV]], Chewbacca went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a [[Besalisk]] vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl, [[Zarro]], who tried to sell her stolen [[speeder bike]]. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord, [[Jaum]]. Chewbacca stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Chewbacca then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.<ref name=\"Chewie 1\">[[Chewbacca (2015) 1|''Chewbacca'' (2015) 1]]</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Chewbacca repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Chewbacca and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the [[Andelm beetle]] larvae to the Empire to be processed into [[Dedlanite]], a substance used in the manufacture of [[blaster]]s.<ref name=\"Chewie 1\" /> To maximise profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.<ref name=\"Chewie 2\" />\n\nThe following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's [[Andelm beetle caverns|mine]]. She got Chewbacca to search for an open air vent for the slave [[miner]]s to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Chewbacca to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Wookiee was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father [[Arrax]] objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.<ref name=\"Chewie 2\" />\n\nBefore Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Chewbacca snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his [[bowcaster]]. After meeting Zarro's father, Chewbacca joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down [[GNK-series power droid]] and used it to disable a [[Jaum's wheeled battle droid|wheeled battle droid]]. Shortly later, the Wookiee knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power droid. Chewbacca eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's [[Shistavanen]] enforcer [[Tyvak]] fired on the incendiary larvae with his blaster, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.<ref name=\"Chewie 2\" />\n\nDespite Tyvak's efforts, Chewbacca and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Wookiee's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Chewbacca and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Chewbacca managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Chewbacca encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power droid. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy droid chassis on the man, leaving him behind.<ref name=\"Chewie 3\">[[Chewbacca (2015) 3|''Chewbacca'' (2015) 3]]</ref>\n\nWhile the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Chewbacca came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Wookiee's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Chewbacca managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Chewbacca then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Chewbacca and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.<ref name=\"Chewie 3\" />\n\nIn truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Chewbacca's support, they traveled to the planet's [[Andelm IV spaceport|spaceport]]. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend [[Sevox]] and his [[protocol droid]] [[I-7]], who served as the \"eyes\" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Chewbacca came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire.<ref name=\"Chewie 3\" /> this plan involved fitting a decrepit [[R5 series astromech droid|R5 repair droid]] with explosives. Sevox thought Chewbacca and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.<ref name=\"Chewie 4\">[[Chewbacca (2015) 4|''Chewbacca'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\nAfter shooing away a group of child beggars, Chewbacca and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new [[Battle droid|war droid]] and a hooded [[alien]]. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers, [[Scout trooper]]s, and an [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walker]]. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Imperial landing craft]]. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Chewbacca opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.<ref name=\"Chewie 4\" />\n\nWhile Chewbacca exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 droid \"[[Boomer (astromech droid)|Boomer]]\" aboard the shuttle. Chewbacca then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Wookiee however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Imperial walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and \"Boomer.\" The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Imperial Commander [[Kai (Imperial)|Kai]], the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.<ref name=\"Chewie 4\" />\n\nPer Commander Kai's orders, Chewbacca and Zarro were transported up to Kai's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to overpower their stormtrooper captors aboard the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]]. After landing, Chewbacca knocked out an Imperial [[RA-7 protocol droid]] that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.<ref name=\"Chewie 5\">[[Chewbacca (2015) 5|''Chewbacca'' (2015) 5]]</ref>\n\nZarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel [[spy]] and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's \"droid\" \"Boomer\" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to escape on a [[TIE/sa bomber]]. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a [[thermal detonator]] which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.<ref name=\"Chewie 5\" />\n\nWhile Chewbacca turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the [[Battle of Yavin]]. After departing as friends, Chewbacca traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village and gave a child a bandolier that belonged to the child's late father, who was being mourned at the moment. Shortly later, Chewbacca departed aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his [[IT-O Interrogator]].<ref name=\"Chewie 5\" />\n\n====Cymoon 1====\n{{Quote|Chewie, stand down! Do not fire!

On one of these assignments, Chewbacca dug into a cave occupied by a [[wampa]]. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Leia and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Chewbacca clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Chewbacca ended with the wampa waking up. The wookiee ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Leia acted as a distraction.

Soon afterwards, Chewbacca and Solo destroyed an [[XJ9-CS14|Imperial probe droid]], but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out [[Battle of Hoth|assault]] on the planet, forcing Chewbacca, Solo, Organa and C-3PO to flee on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nHowever, with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Imperial forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Chewbacca continued to repair the freighter until [[mynock]]s attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a [[Exogorth|space slug]], forcing them to flee. The ''Falcon'' was subsequently attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Avenger]]'', but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to [[Cloud City]] on the [[gas giant]] [[Bespin]], where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintance of Han's.

However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after C-3PO disappeared. Chewbacca took on the task of finding the missing protocol droid, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some [[Ugnaught]] workers, he brought the droid back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Darth Vader, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nSeparated from the others, Chewbacca began to partially reassemble C-3PO, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been [[torture]]d by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freeze chamber|facilities]] where Solo was to be frozen in [[carbonite]] to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Chewbacca tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day.

Chewbacca, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Boba Fett was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the ''Falcon'' to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a [[duel on Cloud City]] with the Sith Lord.

Brought to the pit in a [[skiff]], Skywalker recovered his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|new lightsaber]] and freed Chewbacca and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Chewbacca, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit.

Joined by Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Imperial [[shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', with Chewbacca piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Wookiee to \"fly casual,\" landing only after they were granted access by Darth Vader.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Wicket_and_Rebels.png|thumb|left|275px|The rebels worked with Ewoks to topple the Empire.]]\nOn the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Imperial [[scout]]s, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Chewbacca, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nDuring their search, Chewbacca came across a dead animal on a stake, which proved irresistible bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by [[Ewok]]s. Chewbacca was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas C-3PO was treated like a [[deity]], and the group was transported to [[Bright Tree Village]] to become part of the banquet in C-3PO's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking C-3PO had unleashed his \"[[magic]]\" by [[Telekinesis|levitating]] him with the Force, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after C-3PO's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City, [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] declared them all part of their tribe, with one Ewok giving Chewbacca an enthusiastic hug.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nWith the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Chewbacca accompanied the others and successfully entered the Imperial base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Imperial forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the [[Battle of Endor|assault]] against the Death Star above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Imperial troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Chewbacca to steal an AT-ST with the help of two Ewoks. Using the commandeered walker, they reached the generator's back entrance, where Solo boarded the Imperial transport to broadcast a message to the generator's personnel while posing as an Imperial officer, thereby tricking the installation's crew into opening the door.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|275px|Chewbacca and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor]]\nThanks to the success of Han Solo's ploy, the Rebel forces, Chewbacca among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian, [[Nien Nunb]] and [[Wedge Antilles]] to destroy the Death Star above.

During the mission, he saved [[Sergeant]] Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Chewbacca also fetched C-3PO, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers.

However, Chewbacca was forced to remain on the ''Falcon'', while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the hyperspace drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of [[Krish (species)|Krish]] marauder-ships.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nHowever, as they reached Dasoor, [[Imra]] contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity\u2014Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Chewbacca's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Chewbacca was tasked to contact the Wookiee [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], among them [[Roshyk]], [[Hrrgn]], and [[Kirratha]].<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nWhen Han's wife Leia learned about Han Solo's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Chewbacca not to trust Imra. However, Han and Chewbacca were determined to proceed with their [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|campaign]] to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Chewbacca attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewbacca and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured and locked inside the automated Imperial prison [[Ashmead's Lock]] in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the ''Millennium Falcon'' in attempt to find a way to free his friend.<ref name=\"Life Debt\">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>\n\n=====Escaping Ashmead's Lock=====\nLater, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the [[Siniteen]] architect [[Golas Aram]], who resided on a secluded compound in the planet [[Irudiru]]. Han was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]], her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his battle droid [[Mister Bones]], the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], the Zabrak bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]]. Norra and her team had been sent by Princess Leia to rescue Han. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nFollowing a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Following an emotional reunion, Chewbacca stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic [[capital]] of [[Chandrila]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n=====Liberation of Kashyyyk=====\nFor the next month, Han and Chewbacca organized a campaign to hunt down [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]], the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Chewbacca and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]]. Jas also recruited more Wookiee exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhile Chewbacca, Han, and the rest of the team infiltrated [[Camp Sardo]], Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Imperial officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Wookiee uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and his team fought off a [[Low-altitude Imperial transport]] while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Han's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nAfter Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Chewbacca and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Chewbacca along with Han, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]''. They managed to storm the ''Dominion'' with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nBefore Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Princess Leia aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', Captain Wedge Antilles and his [[Phantom Squadron]], and [[Fleet Admiral]] Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Chewbacca and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the ''Dominion''. They then used the ''Dominion''{{'s}} cannons to destroy the nearby ''[[Vitiator]]''. As a result, the remaining Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Neutralizer]]'' capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Han Solo. Solo then left on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n=====Reunion with Waroo=====\nIn the successive months, Chewbacca took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon [[Commandant]] [[Dessard]] and several Imperial soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Wookiee slave who turned out to be Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Chewbacca personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Chewbacca then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of [[Mount Arayakyak]].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Peaceful retirement====\n{{Quote|No. No!

Chewbacca had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Leia Organa, who had become a leading [[Populists|Populist]] senator in the New Republic's [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]]. Following the [[Napkin Bombing]], Chewbacca sent a message via [[hologram]] to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader destroyed her political career, Chewbacca along with other former Rebel Alliance veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nDespite his peaceful retirement, Chewbacca decided to join him when Han Solo resumed his smuggling activities.

Chewbacca would keep an eye out for him, including one time during which Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters\u2014[[Strater]], [[Hove]], and [[Rigger]]\u2014sent to capture him on the ''Serendipity'' cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Chewbacca sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the ''Serendipity''{{'s}} door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Corellian told them to warn their possible employers ([[Gannis Ducain]], the [[Irving Boys]], the [[Guavian Death Gang|Guavians]], etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\n===Cold war===\n====Recovering the Millennium Falcon====\n{{Quote|Chewie, we're home.|Han Solo upon entering the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Chewbacca after recapturing the freighter|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\n[[File:HanandChewie-TFA.png|thumb|right|300px|Han and Chewie are reunited with the ''Millennium Falcon'' once again]]\nAt some point during the 30 years after the Battle of Endor, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was stolen from Han and Chewbacca,<ref name=\"ICS\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> at the age of 234,<ref name=\"TFAVD\" /> and they were using a ''[[Baleen-class heavy freighter|Baleen]]''[[Baleen-class heavy freighter|-class heavy freighter]], the ''[[Eravana]]'', for their smuggling operations.<ref name=\"ICS\" /> They eventually recovered the ''Falcon'' using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet [[Jakku]]. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewbacca went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] and the defecting [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]] hiding, whom Han assumed were the thieves that had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named [[BB-8]] to the Resistance as he had a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewbacca agreed to help them.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nUnfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and [[Kanjiklub]], who had hired Solo on previous jobs, which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewbacca went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, [[Bala-Tik]], recognizing the [[BB-series astromech droid]] from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three [[rathtar]]s. Han, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the ''Falcon'', though Chewbacca was injured from a blaster shot during the escape.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n====Confronting the First Order====\n[[File:Drop_Your_Weapon_EaW.png|thumb|left|250px|Chewbacca, Han and Finn are captured by the First Order on Takodana.]]\nChewbacca accompanied Han, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to meet with [[Maz Kanata]]. After the [[First Order]] was tipped off that BB-8 was with them, they [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] [[Takodana Castle|Maz's castle]]. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn were captured by the First Order. However, the Resistance had also been tipped off, and Resistance [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]]s led by [[Poe Dameron]] arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs. Ren ordered the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them. Despite the First Order being driven off, Han witnessed Kylo Ren carrying Rey away. The remaining ''Falcon'' crew then rendezvoused with the Resistance at their home base.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> There Chewbacca's wounds were treated by Resistance doctor, Major [[Harter Kalonia]].<ref name=\"TFAVD\" />\n\nAs Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them the Base's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point\u2014a thermal oscillator\u2014that, if destroyed, would eliminate the Base. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its weapon.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:En_Route_to_Starkiller_Base.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chewbacca with Han and Finn, en route to Starkiller Base.]]\nHan Solo piloted the ''Falcon'' to Starkiller Base accompanied by Chewbacca and Finn. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the X-wing squadron to strike, although Finn's main objective was to rescue Rey. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the Falcon landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn snuck into the main base and captured [[Phasma|Captain Phasma]], who they forced to disable the shields before disposing her in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. They reunited with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Poe Dameron commenced [[Battle of Starkiller Base|their assault]]. They fired on the base's weak point, but failed to destroy it as the First Order sent TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nSeeing this, Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Han then confronted his son, Kylo Ren, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his lightsaber to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Han's chest. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca, Han stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Chewbacca fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Finn and Rey also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Chewbacca managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Chewbacca then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy the base's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge the superweapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which would eventually result in destroying the base and leveling the entire planet's terrain.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nAs Chewbacca made his exit from the base, he briefly debated upon whether to pursue and kill Kylo Ren. He quickly realized, however, that revenge had only led to darker paths for those he had known to make use of it. Thus Chewbacca quickly decided that saving those still alive was the better alternative. He quickly commandeered a snow speeder and headed back to the ''Millennium Falcon'' which was guarded by six Snowtroopers. One by one, Chewbacca took them out and entered the Falcon. The Falcon then rose from the snow and headed off to find Rey and Finn.<ref name=\"TFA Junior Novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Chewbacca arrived with the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rescue the scavenger and Finn, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Resistance fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered hyperspace to return to D'Qar.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nThe Resistance celebrated their victory while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourned Han's death. R2-D2 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Luke Skywalker was hiding. Using this, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Rey flew aboard the ''Falcon'' to [[Ahch-To]], where Luke was exiled.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n====Time on Ahch-To====\n[[File:Chewie_and_the_Porgs_mural.png|thumb|right|300x330px|Chewbacca on Ahch-To]]\nAfter Rey tried and failed to recruit Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca decided to help her in convincing his old friend into helping them by busting in his hut. When Luke heard of Han Solo's death, Chewbacca comforted him. Chewbacca was later seen aboard the ''Millennium Falcon ''when Luke came in to remember all the good times he had in his adventure. Later that evening, Chewbacca caught and roasted two [[porg]]s for dinner, but relented when their brethren approached him, watching sadly before scaring them away.<ref name=\"VIII\">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Crait]] between the remaining forces of the Resistance and a First Order invasion army, Chewbacca piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'', using it to lure the Order's TIE fighters away from a force of Resistance [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]]. After the battle, he landed the ship and used it to evacuate the surviving members of the Resistance.<ref name=\"VIII\" />\n\n===Adventures after the Battle of Crait===\nDuring the Resistance's time on Anoat, Chewbacca piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' to save Rey after she provoked an attack by an [[Anoatian pit beast]]. He then piloted the Falcon to [[Mission to Mon Cala|go]] to [[Mon Cala]] and get help from its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref>\n\n===First Order-Resistance War===\nTraveling aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to the [[Sinta Glacier Colony]], Finn and Poe Dameron engaged Chewbacca in an intense game of dejarik. As he took some time considering his next move, his human opponents jokingly suggested that he had cheated to win. The implication infuriated Chewbacca, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Their game was interrupted by an alarm from the cockpit, and Chewbacca ordered his opponents not to turn off the game as he left to check it, but Finn and Poe agreed that he was cheating and shut off the holochess board.<ref name=\"TROS\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker]]</ref>\n\nThe ''Falcon'' arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony, and Finn opened the docking hatch to meet a Resistance informant, [[Boolio]], who informed them about a spy in the First Order and gave them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to give it to General Organa. As First Order TIE fighters jumped into the system, the Resistance members downloaded the message into R2-D2 and made their escape. Poe damaged the ''Falcon'' in the escape, angering Chewbacca, and further infuriated him performing several [[Hyperspace skipping|lightspeed skips]] to shake off their pursuers.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nThe group returned to the Resistance base on [[Ajan Kloss]] bearing the knowledge they obtained from Boolio. They decoded the information, and Poe stated that Palpatine's return was confirmed, and that his Sith Fleet and the Final Order were hiding on [[Exegol]] in the Unknown Regions, but without any leads to the true location of Exegol. Rey, however, had learned from Luke Skywalker's notes in the Jedi texts of a relic known as a [[Sith wayfinder]] that could lead to Exegol. Resolving to continue Luke's search, Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO departed in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to [[Pasaana]], where the original trail went cold.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Mission to Pasaana====\nThe Falcon exited hyperspace over the desert planet of Pasaana and landed at Luke's coordinates near the [[Aki-Aki]] [[Festival of the Ancestors]]. Wandering among the crowd, the group attempted to lay low and blend in. Unsurprisingly, Chewbacca struggled to slouch and keep his head low. At this time, Kylo Ren established a connection with Rey through their [[Force-bond]] and stole a necklace she had received from the Aki-Aki. Rey rushed to warn her comrades that the First Order knew their location and that they needed to find the wayfinder quickly. As they prepared to escape, a lone stormtrooper confronted them before being quickly shot by a mysterious figure. Asking the team to follow him into [[DN-25 treadable|a transport]], the masked savior revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, who had seen Chewbacca in the crowd. Lando showed them a hologram of a Sith wayfinder and explained that only two were ever created. He further revealed that many years prior, he accompanied Luke went in search of the a Sith loyalist named [[Ochi]], whom they believed held a key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his ship abandoned. Lando apparently remained behind on Pasaana.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nThe old hero of the Rebellion offered them directions to Ochi's ship in the desert where he left it, as squadrons of TIEs and First Order dropships flew overhead. Chewbacca and the crew hurried through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders and attracting the attention of two [[125-Z treadspeeder bike|First Order treadspeeders]], which began a fierce pursuit aided by [[First Order jet trooper|jet troopers]]. The troopers proved no match for the Resistance and were swiftly dispatched, though not before sending the stolen speeders crashing into [[Ikledu Wastes|quicksand]]. Chewbacca and his comrades fell into a web of caves below the surface, quickly joining up as they used the glow of the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive flashlight to guide themselves through a series of underground tunnels. There, they discovered the remains of Ochi, his speeder, and a [[Blade of Ochi of Bestoon|dagger]], the clue that Lando and Luke sought after. Rey felt a very strong connection to the weapon, but couldn't quite articulate it. C-3PO identified the writing as a Sith language depicting the location of the wayfinder, but revealed that his programming restricted him from translating the script. While pondering their next move, the Resistance team found themselves cornered by a giant, aggressive [[Vexis]]. Noticing that the serpent was wounded, Rey approached and used the Force to [[Force healing|heal]] its injuries, satiating it and providing them an exit out of the tunnels. Chewbacca took possession of the dagger, placing it in his sachel as the group headed to escape the planet in the ''[[Bestoon Legacy]]'', Ochi's ship.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to Chewbacca and the crew, the [[Knights of Ren]] had arrived on Pasaana to hunt them down. Sensing Kylo Ren's presence, Rey walked out into the desert to confront him alone, but Chewbacca was captured by the Knights before he could retrieve her. The dagger was taken from him as he boarded a First Order transport. Rey and Kylo both noticed the departure of a transport, and while she used the Force to pull the ship back to the ground, Kylo counteracting her by pushing it away. In her frustration, [[Force lightning|lightning]] blasted from Rey's hand, destroying the transport and sending it crashing to the ground. Horrified at the thought of killing Chewbacca, Rey screamed in despair before boarding Ochi's ship with the rest of her crew.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Rescue on Kijimi====\nAs Ochi's ship hurried away from Pasaana, the Resistance team mourned the apparent loss of Chewbacca and the dagger. C-3PO remorsefully told his companions that the dagger's inscription was only committed to his memory. they plan is made to hack into C-3PO's programming to bypass the restrictions. Poe mentions that he has an old contact on the planet [[Kijimi]] that might be able to help them out.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nAboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Steadfast]]'', General Hux presented to Allegiant General Pryde a \"valuable prisoner\" taken during the fighting: Chewbacca, still alive and safe aboard a different transport. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Wookiee, ordered immediate interrogation. Shortly after, Kylo Ren returned to the ''Steadfast'', having failed to accomplish his task set by Palpatine.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nOn Kijimi, Poe tracked down an old contact of his, [[Zorii Bliss]], who brought them to the droidsmith [[Babu Frik]] to override C-3PO's programming to read the Sith language on the dagger, at the cost of his memories.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nDuring the process, the Knights of Ren arrived on Kijimi after following the group there. At the sight of the ''Steadfast'' in the sky, Rey sensed that Chewbacca had survived, and the group staged a rescue mission aboard the Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii. As they boarded, Rey followed the feeling that she needed the dagger, recovering it along with Chewbacca's bowcaster and bandolier. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn rescued Chewbacca, but their rescue attempt failed and resulted in their capture.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nGeneral Pryde ordered General Hux to execute the Resistance members, but Hux turned on his troops, revealed himself to be the Resistance spy, and guided the crew to the ''Falcon''. Before departing Kijimi, they rescued Rey from her confrontation with Kylo Ren in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Loss at Kef Bir====\nThe group traveled to [[Kef Bir]] and Chewbacca stayed behind to repair the ''Falcon'' as Rey attempted to find the wayfinder aboard the [[Death Star ruins|wreckage]] of the second Death Star. While she eventually recovered the wayfinder, Kylo Ren arrived and destroyed it.  In the ensuing lightsaber duel, both Kylo and Rey sensed the death of Leia, giving Rey the chance to defeat him and escape in his ship. Following Rey's departure, Chewbacca and the remainder of the Resistance crew boarded the ''Falcon'' along with their newfound ally [[Jannah]] and returned to their hidden base on Ajan Kloss. Upon returning, Chewbacca learned of Leia's death and mourned her along with the rest of the Resistance.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Battle of Exegol====\nRey was able to locate Exegol with the wayfinder and transmitted her coordinates to R2. The Resistance then used the coordinates to mount a full-scale assault on the Final Order. The Resistance was met with formidable force as the Final Order prepared to overtake the galaxy. Overwhelmed and hopeless, Poe apologized to the Resistance and conceded that the enemy was too formidable to defeat. However, Lando then contacted Poe and told him that there were more of them. Piloting the Falcon along with Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles, Lando led a fleet of reinforcements to aid the Resistance. During the battle, Palpatine severely damaged the Resistance fleet with a massive burst of [[Force lightning]]. However, with the help of their allies and the final destruction of Palpatine, the Resistance was able to defeat the Final Order and save the galaxy.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Victory and thanks====\nUpon returning to Ajan Kloss, the Resistance celebrated their victory. During the celebration, Maz called Chewbacca over to her and awarded the Wookiee a medal<ref name=\"TROS\" /> which was once worn by Han Solo.<ref name=\"Medal Databank\">{{Databank|medal-of-yavin|Medal of Yavin|archivedate=20200517082035}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Always thinking with your stomach.|Han Solo to Chewbacca|audio=AlwaysThinkingWithYourStomach.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:Chewbacca_ME.png|thumb|left|200px|Chewbacca crushes a stormtrooper under his foot]]\nKnown for his great strength, bravery and loyalty, Chewbacca often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors,<ref name=\"anh-PSFB\" /> which made people trust him more than they did Solo.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" /> However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.<ref name=\"SW10\" />\n\nAs a Wookiee, Chewbacca knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the ''Falcon''; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" /> Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior.<ref name=\"anh-PSFB\" /> Sometimes, when he was bored, he would \"mess around\" with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} navigation system.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n[[File:AGoodBlasterAtYourSide-GaG.png|thumb|right|200px|Chewbacca was fiercely loyal to Han Solo, having sworn a life debt to him.]]\nWhen his friend Han Solo briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Hoth, Chewbacca was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return.

For his appearance in ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', Chewbacca was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.\n\nThe memorable voice of Chewbacca was designed by [[Ben Burtt]], sound designer for all nine films.
