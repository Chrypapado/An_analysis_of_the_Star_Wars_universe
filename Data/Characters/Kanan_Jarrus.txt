I ''was'' a coward. But now, I know there's something ''stronger'' than fear. ''Far'' stronger. The Force.|Kanan Jarrus, to The Grand Inquisitor|Fire Across the Galaxy}}\n'''Kanan Jarrus''', [[Reproduction|born]] '''Caleb Dume''', was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Jedi Knight]] who survived [[Order 66]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. Living on thanks to the [[Death|sacrifice]] of his [[Jedi Master|Master]], [[Depa Billaba]], on [[Kaller]], he met the [[smuggler]] [[Janus Kasmir]], who taught him how to survive as a fugitive. Going into hiding, he forsook the [[Jedi]] ways for some [[time]], swapping his [[Color|blue]]-bladed [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|lightsaber]] for a [[blaster]]. After working with the [[Twi'lek]] [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebel]] operative [[Hera Syndulla]] during the [[Gorse conflict]], Jarrus decided to join her [[Spectres|nascent rebel cell]].\n\nAs Syndulla's second-in-command, the two came to develop a romantic relationship. After [[the Force]]-sensitive teenager [[Ezra Bridger]] joined the Spectres, Jarrus became his Jedi mentor despite still being a [[Padawan]]. After [[Action at Mustafar|defeating]] [[the Grand Inquisitor]] in combat, Jarrus and his fellow rebels learned they were part of a larger rebellion and joined [[Phoenix Cell]]. During a [[Mission to Malachor|mission]] to [[Malachor]], Jarrus was blinded by the former [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul]]. After [[Standard month|months]] of retreat, Jarrus restored his connection to the Force and repaired his frayed relationship with Bridger with the help of a mysterious being called [[Bendu]], who taught him to see things through the Force.\n\nThe reinvigorated Jarrus and his fellow rebels continued to fight various adversaries including [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and Maul, who sought to corrupt Bridger and destroy [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], the key to destroying the [[Sith]]. Regaining his confidence, Jarrus also taught the [[Mandalorian]] rebel [[Sabine Wren]] how to wield the [[Darksaber]] and helped her to rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause. As the Rebel Alliance escalated its [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|struggle]] with the Empire, Kanan and his fellow rebels returned to free [[Lothal]], a [[Planet|world]] which they had a special connection with.\n\nJarrus eventually met his death  on Lothal around [[0 BBY|the year]]<ref name=\"Death year\" /> of the [[Battle of Yavin]], during the [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue]] of Hera Syndulla after [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] ordered her [[walker]] to fire on the fuel pod they were on, sacrificing himself to allow his fellow rebels to escape. Following Jarrus' death, he became a part of the [[Cosmic Force]], manifesting as a huge [[loth-wolf]] named [[Dume (Loth-wolf)|Dume]], which appeared to Ezra several times. Later, Hera gave birth to their [[Parent|son]], whom she named [[Jacen Syndulla|Jacen]].\n\n[[35 ABY|Over three and a half decades after]] his death, the voices of Jarrus and many other great Jedi, including his friend [[Ahsoka Tano]], were heard by and encouraged the last living Jedi, the young aspirant [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], to use their power to destroy [[Darth Sidious]], the returned [[Emperor]] and her grandfather, during the [[Battle of Exegol]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I might be young for a Padawan, but I passed my trials, same as you two.

As he and Billaba familiarized themselves with the new battalion, they were to do a simple reconnaissance mission to refute or confirm reports of a Separatist presence on the planet. The morning after their arrival, Billaba split the battalion into five [[squad]]s to reconnoiter five canyons, with Dume accompanying Billaba. During the walk, Dume befriended [[CT-1157]], who had not yet received a nickname. Unbeknownst to them, they were observed by a [[Separatist probe droid|probe droid]] and promptly ambushed by the [[Separatist Droid Army]], which destroyed their trail, leaving them no option but to resist before reinforcements arrived.<ref name=\"Kanan 9\" />\n\nAs their signal was jammed (leaving them unable to contact the other squads), Billaba left Dume and other troopers to keep the Separatist forces occupied, while she located the Separatist's [[Starship|ship]]. However, during the [[Skirmish on Kardoa|skirmish]], Dume got too far out front and disobeyed a [[Clone trooper|trooper's]] order that he pull back, and received two shots from the enemy [[droid]]s. Left vulnerable to three B1 battle droids, CT-1157 went to his rescue and destroyed the three droids, for which he would earn the name \"Stance.\" Fortunately for the two, General [[Coburn Sear]] ordered his troops to pull back to secure their ship, and Billaba managed to make them depart Kardoa. Their first battle being a success, Dume underwent [[bacta]] treatment for his injuries, and before long, the battalion received its next assignment: [[Mygeeto]].<ref name=\"Kanan 9\" />\n\n====Mygeeto====\n{{Quote|My master, Depa Billaba, and I were pinned down, trapped by droids.

Dume, Billaba, Grey, and Stance were able to hold off the battle droids until [[Skull Squadron]] helped them. Dume and the others then returned to their base camp. They were then confronted by Confederate forces under General Grievous and Colonel Coburn Sear. There he watched as Sear killed Stance.<ref name=\"Kanan 10\">[[Kanan 10|''Kanan'' 10]]</ref>\n\nDume then fought Sear to avenge Stance. During their fight, Dume was able to destroy Sear's [[electro sword]] and cut the fuel to his [[flamethrower]]. Dume gave him the chance to surrender, but Sear refused. Dume then watched as Sear burned himself alive and continue trying to kill until he moved away. Dume watched as Sear leapt to his death, acknowledge Sear as his first kill. Dume, Grey and Styles then rushed to find rescue Billaba from Grievous. They saved Billaba, but Grievous and his forces retreated.

Though the meeting with [[Gamut Key]] and other [[Kalleran]]s and was marked by the discussion of Dume, Grey and Styles with [[Janus Kasmir]] who expressed little gratitude to the Jedi General, the three were silenced by Billaba, who moved her troops to rest in the field under the stars.<ref name=\"Kanan 1\" />\n\n[[File:Caleb_Dume_Depa_Billaba_training.png|thumb|right|301x301px|Dume training under his master, Billaba, on Kaller.]]\nWhile the two were alone, Billaba told Dume she had been neglecting his training and the two went onto practicing Form III until nighttime. She also asked Dume how he felt, and Dume told her that his heart was at peace, having found his place in the galaxy. Billaba told him, however, that he mustn't grow too attached to life as it was then, and though valuable, he had to learn to rule his emotions. Afterwards, he shared a moment of rapport with his master, Grey and Styles (with whom Dume had developed a sense of camaraderie) at a bonfire. Though they teased him about his inquisitive nature, Billaba gave him a [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|holocron]] so that he could \"study the role of questions\" and \"peaceful dissent\" in the Order.<ref name=\"Kanan 1\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Battle of Coruscant]], General Grievous ordered the remaining Separatist forces to launch an offensive across several star systems, leading to Kaller again being besieged. Dume was sent by Billaba to find reinforcements during a battle against a group of Separatist forces in a snowy region of the planet away from the capital. He found the [[clone commando]]s of [[Clone Force 99]] and rejoined his master. Together they watched the commandos take the battle droids and their AATs.

As he reluctantly fled, he ran into Clone Force 99, and told them to stay away from him, unaware that they were not being affected by Order 66, and ran off to the forest. He was chased by Clone Force 99 members [[Hunter]] and [[CT-9904|Crosshair]], who learned that Order 66 was meant to assassinate all Jedi. Hunter tried to help Dume, while Crosshair tried to eliminate him, claiming that he was \"following orders.\" Dume hid in a tree as the two clones searched for him, with Crosshair eventually discovering him and firing on him again. Hunter tried to talk it out with Dume, but Dume fled until he was trapped by a gorge. Hunter arrived and put down his weapon and advancing slowly towards him. Dume yelled for him to stay back, but Hunter kept advancing. Then, Dume leapt over the gorge, with Hunter letting him go and instead lying, telling Crosshair that he had killed the Jedi.<ref name=\"TBB\" /> Having regained his cloak, Dume evaded the clones all night, and by sunrise he reached an outlying public transport station with a [[transport]] going into [[Plateau City]]. When he got there, Dume spotted a clone using a [[Hologram|holoimage]] of him and giving the order to kill on sight. So, for several days, Dume evaded clone patrols, not sleeping out of fear of being caught in one spot too long, and due to not having any [[credit]]s, was forced to search dumpsters for food.<ref name=\"Kanan 2\" />\n\n====Partner to Kasmir====\n{{Quote|You lie.

Kasmir gave in and allowed him to borrow the spare bunk in his ship, the ''[[Kasmiri]]''. After a bath, Dume slept for a full planetary rotation, and Kasmir gave Dume some clothes so that he would not be running around in Jedi robes.

Kasmir then brought Dume back to the ''Kasmiri'', where he chastised him for ruining the negotiations to hire them for a job. So he had Dume take their place and told him to abandon his Jedi apparel. Thus, Dume severed his [[Padawan braid]], destroyed his Jedi comlink after uploading Kenobi's message into the holocron, and hid it and his lightsaber away. He put on different clothes and took a blaster, and realized from Kasmir that he needed a new name before accompanying Kasmir to steal [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM droids]] to sell on the [[black market]]. However, the pair were caught by the guards, and Kasmir betrayed Dume in exchange for the IG-RM droids.<ref name=\"Kanan 3\" /> Imprisoned in a cell and awaiting his execution, Dume heard as Key contacted Grey and Styles to inform him of Dume's capture.

All the while they were tracked down to be [[Great Jedi Purge|eliminated]] by Grey and Styles,<ref name=\"Kanan 4\" /> faithful [[soldier]]s of the recently established [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Eventually, they would go to [[Lahn]], where during a job, Dume would meet Kasmir's trading partner, Jondo\u2014actually, the former Separatist general, Kleeve. At first, Dume threatened to kill him, but stood down when he accepted that the Clone Wars were truly over and went to meet up with Kasmir, who had been arrested by Styles and Grey. Instead of helping him, Dume abandoned Kasmir and met with Kleeve, whom he convinced to let him take it. Kleeve agreed and took him to the ''[[Escape]]'', where the pair were captured by clone troopers.<ref name=\"Kanan 4\" />\n\nGrey and Styles placed the unconscious Dume aboard their [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] to return to Kaller, deciding what to do before they executed him. Despite Dume telling them that it was really Palpatine who had betrayed the Galactic Republic and not him and the Jedi Order, the clones were unconvinced. Pushing the two clones away, Dume then and put his trust in the Force one last time opened the [[airlock]]. Sucked into space, he was [[Rescue of Caleb Dume|rescued]] by Kasmir and Kleeve (aboard the ''Kasmiri'' and the ''Escape'', respectively), whose ships were unable to hold the Imperial for long. At the same time, Grey realized the mistake he had made earlier during the execution of Order 66 and destroyed their ship's controls, taking down its [[Deflector shield|shields]]. In turn, Dume, Kasmir and Kleeve fired at the ship, destroying it and killing Grey, Styles and other troopers in the process. Afterwards, they landed on Kaller, where he suggested to Kasmir that he and Kleeve work together, while he would go away. Kasmir, however, knew he was protecting himself from suffering another loss, but Dume hit him to get his point across. Taking his lightsaber and holocron with him aboard the ''Escape'', Kasmir bid Dume farewell, as the former Padawan departed for [[Moraga]], where he started to call himself Kanan Jarrus.<ref name=\"Kanan 5\">[[Kanan 5|''Kanan'' 5]]</ref>\n\nForced to hide his [[Force-sensitive|Force-sensitivity]], Jarrus kept his lightsaber locked away and forsook the Jedi ways for a long time,<ref name=\"AND\" /> disguising himself as a freighter [[pilot]], a [[bounty hunter]], and a frontier [[ranger]].<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> Drinking away his problems and attempting to woo university girls, Kanan drifted from planet to planet in order to avoid the watchful eye of the Empire, never staying too long in any one place, and never distinguishing himself from others.<ref name=\"AND\" /> Over time, he also found and collected spare lightsaber parts.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref> Eventually, Jarrus emigrated to [[Gorse]], where he met [[Okadiah Garson]] at his bar, [[The Asteroid Belt]], when he broke up a brawl there.

He returned to The Asteroid Belt, where he met [[Zaluna Myder]], and Jarrus took part of her secret reunion with Syndulla until Skelly's interruption, when the [[Twi'lek]] revealed she was investigating Count Vidian, hoping to know what he was doing on Gorse.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nOn Syndulla's insistence, Jarrus agreed to take her to Moonglow in the next work shift, where he met [[Imperial Navy]] Captain [[Rae Sloane]] face to face during her search for the dissident miner Skelly, who had tried to convince Vidian to halt mining operations on Cynda. However, the Imperial soon departed to their [[spaceport]] after another of Skelly's bombings. Their borrowing of Garson's bus, however, prompted Jarrus to chase after them. After recovering the bus, escaping with Syndulla and Skelly and finding Myder trapped in the restroom, they discarded the now-useless vessel in a junkyard.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nAfter some rest, Jarrus agreed to guide them through town only, unwilling to attract Imperial attention and wanting to leave the system once and for all. Nevertheless, the Imperial-provoked explosion on Cynda prompted him to take ''Expedient'' and ask Syndulla to retrieve Garson's team, who were on a work shift at the time\u2014only to discover their demise. Willing to stop Vidian's machinations, Jarrus, Syndulla, Skelly and Myder headed to [[Calcoraan Depot]], where the former Padawan had the idea to intercept Vidian's report to the Emperor. They infiltrated the [[cyborg]]'s private room, and later confronted him; the Count's [[cybernetics]] allowed them to uncover most of his plans. On Jarrus' suggestion, they also warned Sloane about Vidian's plans, with Jarrus claiming to Sloane that he himself was a deep-undercover agent for the Emperor.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\n[[File:JustDance.png|thumb|right|243x243px|Jarrus saves Syndulla on Gorse.]]\nThen, they headed back to the [[Gorse system]], where they tried to delay Cynda's destruction by targeting the [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] escorting baradium haulers, and later infiltrating Vidian's ''[[Forager]]'' so that Myder could tap into its [[Transcept Media Solutions|Transcept systems]] and send a warning to Gorse. Once inside, Jarrus and Myder faced Count Vidian in his chamber, a few minutes before Sloane issued his arrest. Vidian's determination forced Sloane to order the destruction of ''Forager''{{'s}} transmission tower.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nDuring the ''[[Ultimatum]]''{{'s}} attack, Jarrus saved Syndulla, making use of [[the Force]] and revealing his true nature to her. They, along with Myder, escaped the ship's destruction in one of its life pods. Landing on Gorse, it allowed Jarrus time to leave a trail placing him on Gorse during [[Gorse conflict|the conflict]]. After they parted, Jarrus bade farewell to Myder in her new home, and Syndulla accepted his proposal to become a crew member of her ship, the ''[[Ghost]]''.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\n====Rescuing Graysom====\n{{Quote|The holocron's empty.

After that incident, Kanan and Hera returned to the ''Ghost'' and found Graysom's escape pod. When they found Graysom, he claimed that the ''Hoopaloo Nest'' was haunted.<ref name=\"Haunting of the Ghost\" />\n\nKanan and Hera did not believe Graysom's claims until the light went out and they heard laughter. Kanan then saw an electrical discharge aimed at Hera. The ''Ghost''{{'s}} bay doors opened, and Kanan was about to be sucked into space. He was saved by Chopper. Kanan watched Graysom and took him to his cabin. However, the voice sealed Graysom and Kanan in his quarters without his lightsaber. Kanan used the Force to levitate his lightsaber and cut through his cabin's door.

After the attack disabled both the ''Ghost''{{'s}} shields and internal comm system, Jarrus and Syndulla began giving Chopper conflicting orders over which system to fix first. It was Chopper who ultimately destroyed the final TIE, and his efforts were recognized by the two organics before the ship blasted into hyperspace.<ref name=\"The Machine in the Ghost\" />\n\nOn another occasion, Jarrus was supposed to rendezvous with Orrelios. The Lasat had shown up at the wrong alleyway and, against Jarrus' protestations via [[comlink]], picked a fight with several [[stormtrooper]]s, which culminated in the destruction of a TIE fighter.

Forced to pursue him, Jarrus finally recovered the crate by offering the boy a chance to escape in the ''Ghost''. Jarrus witnessed Bridger as he unknowingly used the Force to leap into the hovering ship with his crate. With Bridger safely on board, the ''Ghost'' left the planet and jumped into hyperspace, losing the TIE fighters pursuing them. Jarrus and Syndulla received their payment from [[Cikatro Vizago]] and information about a group of [[Wookiee]]s enslaved by the Empire. Alerted by Chopper, Jarrus went into his quarters only to spot Bridger with his lightsaber in hand. He demanded that he hand over it, but knowingly allowed the boy to steal his holocron as a secret test.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\">{{Rebels|Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion|Spark of Rebellion}}</ref>\n\nDetermined to save the Wookiees, Jarrus, Wren, Orrelios and Chopper entered a ''Gozanti''-class cruiser, but were soon driven off the ship by the arrival of [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] on the ''[[Lawbringer]]''.<ref name=\"The Rebellion Begins\">''[[The Rebellion Begins]]''</ref> Bridger's resulting capture, however, led the crew to argue about whether to rescue the boy. Left as the deciding vote, Jarrus chose to mount a rescue\u2014only to find Bridger waiting near the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer's]] docking bay. Once inside the ''Ghost'', Bridger revealed to them that he had learned of the Wookiees' location in the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of [[Kessel]]. Soon enough, they reached the planet and fought stormtroopers so that Bridger could release the Wookiees from captivity. Cornered by Kallus and his men, Jarrus ignited his lightsaber and publicly revealed himself to be a Jedi, giving everyone time to escape. After being picked up via cargo container, Jarrus and the ''Ghost'' arrived in time to save Bridger and [[Kitwarr]] from Kallus and escaped from Kessel.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\nSoon after the Wookiees' departure, Bridger stole Jarrus' lightsaber from his belt, and kept it until they returned to Lothal. During his farewell, however, the boy returned the holocron to the former Jedi. Jarrus, aware of his Force-sensitivity, met up with Bridger at [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|his tower]] and gave the boy two choices\u2014to keep the lightsaber as a useless relic and remain on Lothal, or return to the ship and become Jarrus' Padawan, and a member of the crew. Awaiting for his answer on the ''Ghost'', Jarrus opened the holocron and played Obi-Wan Kenobi's full message. As it ended, Bridger returned the Jedi's lightsaber, and Jarrus ended up taking the boy under his wing to teach him how to control his [[Force power|powers]].<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\n====Garel====\n[[File:Cikatro_Vizago_Weapons.png|thumb|right|306x306px|Jarrus trying to sell E-11 blaster rifles to Cikatro Vizago.]]\nAfter taking on Ezra as his apprentice, Jarrus took part in a [[mission to steal Imperial weapons]] from the planet [[Garel]]. The rebels were short of funds and planned to sell them to the crime lord Vizago. During the mission, Jarrus along with Wren, Bridger, Chopper, and Orrelios boarded the same [[Star Commuter 2000|star commuter shuttle]] carrying [[Amda Wabo]], [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]], and the droids [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to Garel. During the journey, Jarrus, Bridger, and Chopper staged an argument which got Chopper along with R2-D2 and C-3PO sent to the storage compartment. This enabled Sabine to offer her services as an [[Aqualish (language)|Aqualish]] translator for Wabo and Tua.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>\n\nWren discovered that the weapons were located in Bay 7. After arranging with Syndulla to rendezvous with them, the rebels stole the weapons and fought off Tua's stormtroopers. During the confusion, R2-D2 and C-3PO stowed aboard the ''Ghost''; unknown to the rebels, the two droids were on a secret mission to prevent the Imperials from taking the weapons. Returning to Lothal, the rebels attempted to sell the [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s to Vizago, but before they could complete the transaction, the rebels were interrupted by the arrival of [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] Agent Kallus, who brought two [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walkers]] and several stormtroopers. During the skirmish, Jarrus stopped a [[walker]] with a disruptor rifle. Orrelios was defeated by Agent Kallus but Bridger used the Force to save the Lasat before Kallus could deliver the finishing blow. Meanwhile, R2-D2 helped Wren and the other rebels to destroy the remaining disruptors. After defeating the Imperials, Jarrus personally returned the droids to their rightful owner, [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]]. The [[Senator]] never revealed his identity, but paid Jarrus generously before he left on the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nLater on Lothal, Bridger and Orrelios got into a fight aboard the ''Ghost''. As punishment, Syndulla sent them to buy some groceries including a [[meiloorun fruit]]. However, the two rebels ran into trouble and [[Attack on Imperial Troop Transports|stole]] a [[Rebels TIE fighter|TIE fighter]]. After learning of their predicament, Jarrus ordered the two to destroy the vessel.<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref> Despite this, Bridger and Orrelios refused, but kept it a secret so as to preserve it.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\n====Fool's Run====\n{{Quote|If you flew a little bit better we wouldn't have gotten damaged in the first place.\"<br />\"Really?

Hoping to obtain the parts from long-time \"associate\" [[Galus Vez]]'s black-market operation, Jarrus and his team then met with the [[Besalisk]]. However, as the Empire had been doubling their inspections since their last visit, he refused to the transaction and challenged Syndulla to a race in [[Fool's Run]], which, much to Jarrus' dismay, Syndulla accepted. During the race, when Vez started to play unfair, Jarrus and Bridger noticed it and helped Syndulla. By concentrating, they used the Force and pushed two [[asteroid]]s to impede Vez's passage and help Syndulla win the race. When Vez was angered, he tried to retaliate by handing them over to the Empire, but Jarrus, Bridger and Syndulla resisted, and threatened to destroy Vez's cargo ships. Forced to cooperate, Vez gave them the parts, and the ''Ghost'' departed.<ref name=\"Ring Race\">{{SWRMCite|1|Ring Race}}</ref>\n\n====Stygeon Prime====\n{{Quote|There've always been rumors she survived the Clone Wars, but they never came with a specific location before.

On one occasion, Jarrus was forced to rescue Bridger during a training lesson above Lothal's [[atmosphere]]. Later, Jarrus learnt from one of [[Gall Trayvis]]'s broadcasts that Jedi Master Luminara Unduli was still alive but imprisoned in the [[Stygeon system]]. Jarrus immediately resolved to rescue her, hoping to deliver Bridger to a full-fledged Master for training. Together with the whole crew, Jarrus devised a plan to enter the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]] and rescue Unduli.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" />\n\nWhile Chopper waited aboard the ''Ghost'', Jarrus and the other rebels descended to the Spire in the ''[[Phantom]]''. After landing on the prison's landing platform, Jarrus along with Bridger, Wren, and Orrelios entered the prison complex. While latter two guarded the [[turbolift]] terminal, Jarrus and Bridger took a lift to reach the prisoner's cell. After using the Force to play [[mind trick]]s on the stormtroopers guarding her cell, the pair entered Unduli's cell only to discover her corpse, just before being cornered by [[the Grand Inquisitor]], who revealed that he had used Unduli's remains to lure Jedi survivors to their deaths. Confronted by the Jedi hunter, Jarrus was forced to engage in a [[lightsaber duel]], which continued into the Spire's corridors. The [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] proved more than a match for Jarrus and taunted him for being a \"poor student.\" Jarrus and Bridger fled the Inquisitor and were rejoined by Wren and Orrelios to escape into a sealed [[hangar]] bay.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" />\n\nWith the Inquisitor temporarily held back, Jarrus convinced his apprentice to use the Force to unlock the outer hangar doors only to be surrounded by more stormtroopers. Fortunately for the rebels, Syndulla arrived in the ''Phantom'' accompanied by a large swarm of [[tibidee]]s, which proceeded to harass the Imperials, and Jarrus's team took advantage of the chaos to flee. Following their adventure on [[Stygeon Prime]], Bridger told Jarrus he didn't need to continue training him if he didn't want to, but Jarrus explained that he only wanted the best teacher for Bridger, and recalled Master Yoda's words and vowed to continue training Ezra with a newfound resolve. He explained to Bridger that he would stop ''trying'' to train him and would actually train him properly, and Bridger agreed to continue training under him.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" />\n\n====Further missions====\nDuring one of Bridger's lesson on telekinesis, his Padawan was frustrated with his slow learning, but Jarrus tried to teach him that patience was one of the most valuable skills a Jedi had to learn. The next day, he and Orrelios took the ''Phantom'' to destroy an Imperial transmission center, during which the rest of the ''Ghost'' crew engaged Imperials in a [[skirmish near an ion storm]].<ref name=\"Learning Patience\">{{SWRMCite|2|Learning Patience}}</ref>\n\nDuring a [[Mission to destroy a kyber crystal|mission]] to destroy a massive kyber crystal in possession of the Empire, Jarrus sent Bridger into the [[Academy for Young Imperials]] on Lothal to steal a [[decoder]] containing information about their target. When Bridger, with the assistance of fellow [[Imperial cadet]] [[Zare Leonis]], stole the decoder and got Wren to transmit the information to Jarrus and Syndulla, he also opted to prolong his stay at the academy to rescue a Force-sensitive [[cadet]] named [[Jai Kell]] from being abducted by the Inquisitor. Despite his misgivings about Bridger's safety, Jarrus and Syndulla continued their mission and intercepted the Imperial convoy carrying the kyber crystal; using the Force, Jarrus located the crystal in the middle ''Gozanti''-class cruiser. While Jarrus piloted the ''Phantom'' and distracted the escorting TIE fighters, Syndulla attacked the middle [[cruiser]] and successfully destroyed the crystal. The pair narrowly escaped a great explosion, which wiped out the rest of the convoy. They then returned to Lothal to rendezvous with Bridger and the other Spectres.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\">{{Rebels|Breaking Ranks}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kanan_cheetah_people.png|thumb|right|258x258px|Kanan with Vyndal's natives.]]\nDuring a solo mission on the ''Phantom'', he was fleeing from the Inquisitor's forces when he was attacked by TIE fighters. The [[VCX-series auxiliary starfighter]] was severely damaged while Jarrus was injured. Though he managed to land the craft mostly intact on [[Vyndal]], he passed out and was rescued by [[Unidentified alien woman (Vyndal)|a native]] and [[Unidentified alien boy (Vyndal)|her son]]. The two brought to their home to protect him from the [[Tree|forest's]] night creatures, and when he awoke, the woman took him to see [[Unidentified village (Vyndal)|their village]] leader, [[Yeleb]] \"the Protector.\" Jarrus realized almost immediately Yeleb's deception (posing as a Jedi and in possession of a lightsaber) and asked for a private audience. After some initial animosity, Yeleb revealed how he had come to obtain the weapon, only for the Grand Inquisitor and his men to arrive at the village. Refusing to let the Imperials raze the village, both Jarrus and Yeleb fought the Inquisitor; during the [[Skirmish on Vyndal|skirmish]], Yeleb was mortally wounded, and Jarrus was forced to trick the Inquisitor into believing he had left the planet aboard one of their own ships. With the Imperials driven off, Jarrus returned and recognized Yeleb's courage before he died, and encouraged the villagers that they could defend themselves as they had done during the skirmish before leaving the planet.<ref name=\"Fake Jedi\">{{SWRMCite|3|The fake Jedi}}</ref>\n\nOn another mission, Jarrus piloted the ''Ghost'' to rescue Syndulla and Wren from [[Fort Anaxes]], an abandoned Republic base on the asteroid [[PM-1203]] that was infested with [[fyrnock]]s. Syndulla and Wren's predicament had arisen when Bridger, Orrelios, and Chopper neglected to check a fuel leak on the ''Phantom''. Unable to escape, the two women contacted the ''Ghost'' for help. Jarrus was [[Meditation|meditating]] in his chambers when he heard Bridger and Orrelios panicking outside. After reprimanding the two, Jarrus flew the ''Ghost'' to Fort Anaxes and rescued Syndulla and Wren.<ref name=\"Out of Darkness\">{{Rebels|Out of Darkness}}</ref>\n\n====Return to Kaller====\n{{Quote|What's the matter, luv?

Furthermore, the provincial [[governor]], Gamut Key, and his constabularies arrived at the scene, for they had received a tip that smugglers were using the area as a drop point and demanded that they let him search the ship. With nothing to hide, Syndulla allowed them; before long, Key and his men left them to their devices. Instead of leaving, much to Jarrus' reluctance, the team decided to track the ship themselves.<ref name=\"Kanan 6\" />\n\nOnce they reached Plateau City, Jarrus decided to split the team up to cover more ground, and refused to let Syndulla accompany him, saying he would go with Chopper. Eventually, he followed the intel he thought led to his old former friend and ex-partner, Janus Kasmir, but instead, he found T\u00e1pusk. Almost giving away his identity, he said that the supplies belonged to his operation, but T\u00e1pusk refused to give them back, for which Jarrus started a confrontation with them, taking out all of T\u00e1pusk's men single-handedly and unarmed. Once he was finished, Jarrus contacted the team to tell them he had recovered the supplies. Then, although Chopper tried to alert him of T\u00e1pusk, Jarrus' senses were clouded by his memories of Kaller, and the Kalleran stabbed him in the back.<ref name=\"Kanan 6\" />\n\nInjured, Jarrus immediately knocked him out, and Gamut Key appeared to thank Jarrus for taking down T\u00e1pusk's operations and tell him that perhaps, the rebellion could use his help as an old politician on occasion, before leaving him alone. Not too long afterward, Jarrus passed out from [[blood]] loss.<ref name=\"Kanan 6\" /> The team arrived then and took him to a [[medcenter]], where he was placed in a bacta tank, under the careful eye of his teammates,<ref name=\"Kanan 7\" /> who were told he needed to be in there for a few weeks or until he regained consciousness. However, Imperial forces surrounded the building to capture them.<ref name=\"Kanan 8\" /> Kanan then awoke and used the Force to break the bacta tank, taking the stormtroopers by surprise. He then grabbed his lightsaber and killed the troopers.<ref name=\"Kanan 11\" />\n\nJarrus and Bridger stayed behind on Kaller because of a coded message he received from his old friend, [[Morfizo]] of Moraga. Jarrus and Bridger then went with Governor Key to Moraga to speak with Morfizo's wife [[Morfizia]] and her children. There, Jarrus was told that Morfizo had been taken to Lahn by the Empire for joining a rebel cell. After sending Mofizia and her family to Kaller with Key, Jarrus and Bridger then took the ''Escape'' to Lahn. Once there, they went to the Imperial outpost at [[Illmek Island Spaceport]]. While Bridger distracted the two guards outside, Jarrus made his way to the roof. There, he cut into the ceiling with his lightsaber and then got a drop on the guards. Jarrus then met with Morfizo.<ref name=\"Kanan 12\">[[Kanan 12|''Kanan'' 12]]</ref>\n\nHowever, the officer in charge shot at Jarrus. The officer, [[Vice Admiral]] Sloane, ordered Jarrus to drop his blaster. Jarrus was told by Sloane that after their encounter with each other on Gorse,<ref name=\"AND\" /> she knew he was more than just a \u201cmouthy pilot.\u201d In her spare time, Sloane looked up Jarrus's history that led her to Moraga and Morfizo. She learned that \"Kanan Jarrus\" never existed before he went to Moraga. Jarrus then asked if Morfizo was imprisoned just to capture him. Sloane told Jarrus that when she discovered Morfizo was a rebel, she hoped that his arrest would lead Jarrus back to her. Jarrus then Force-pushed her into the force field, knocking her out.<ref name=\"Kanan 12\" />\n\nJarrus then took his blaster back and then freed Morfizo. Together, they made their way back to the ''Escape'' to meet up with Bridger. They returned to Kaller, where Jarrus and Bridger reunited Morfizo with his family.<ref name=\"Kanan 12\" />\n\n====Empire Day====\n{{Quote|I am ready. Wait.

Following Senator Trayvis's broadcast, the Spectres ruined the Imperial parade by detonating a bomb in the recently-unveiled [[TIE Advanced v1]]. During their escape, Bridger guided Jarrus and Wren into [[Bridger household|his old residence]], where they met Tseebo and found about Bridger's painful past.<ref name=\"Empire Day\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref>\n\nConsidering the valuable information the Rodian possessed, the three rebels decided to [[Rescue of Tseebo|smuggle him out of Lothal]] in a stolen [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]]. Despite Kallus's intervention, Jarrus managed to board the ''Ghost'' along with the rest of the crew. However, they were soon followed by the Inquisitor, who managed to place a [[XX-23 S-thread tracker]] in the ''Phantom''. Aware of this, Jarrus devised a plan to lure the Inquisitor to Fort Anaxes by detaching the [[shuttle]] while the ''Ghost'' was still on hyperspace.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\n[[File:Gathering_Forces_06.jpg|thumb|right|220x220px|Kanan faces the Grand Inquisitor on PM-1203.]]\nOnce there, he removed the tracking device off the ''Phantom'' and prompted Bridger to let go of his fear, so that he could connect with the fyrnocks. Both master and apprentice, then, awaited for the Inquisitor's coming, and Jarrus engaged in combat with the [[Pau'an]] once again. However, the Inquisitor managed to knock him out with a powerful [[Force push]]. He only regained consciousness just as Bridger tapped into the [[dark side of the Force]] and controlled an enormous fyrnock to attack the Inquisitor, who was also wielding Jarrus's lightsaber at the time. The creature kept the Inquisitor busy enough that Jarrus was able to bring the now-unconscious Bridger to the ''Phantom'', recover his lightsaber and destroy the [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Imperial shuttle]]. As they returned to the ''Ghost'', Jarrus told Bridger that he had made a dangerous connection to the Force, and apologized for not teaching him what he needed to know.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref>\n\nDuring a mission to swipe the Lothal Imperial Academy's new recruits, Wren [[Mission to free MaDall's slaves|let herself be captured]] and taken to the [[Zygerrian]] [[Slavery|slaver]] [[MaDall]], prompting Jarrus and the rest of the team to look for clues of her whereabouts. When they found one of her [[graffiti]] stencils leading them to the planet [[Oon]], Jarrus and his team followed the clue and, upon their encounter, Jarrus chastised her for not warning them beforehand. Not wanting to bring themselves to her level, they let MaDall free and returned, with Wren, to the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Return of the Slavers\">{{SWRMCite|5|Return of the Slavers}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bridger left to practice his Jedi training alone and was captured by the bounty hunters [[Gowski]] and [[Fissol]], Jarrus felt something was amiss and rode his personal [[Joben T-85 speeder bike]] to their encounter. To rescue his Padawan, Jarrus defeated the two bounty hunters and freed Bridger, and at the prospect of letting Gowski and Fissol with the knowledge of their existence, Jarrus did a mind trick on them so that they thought there were no Jedi on Lothal and duo left Lothal.<ref name=\"Eyes on the Prize\">{{SWRMCite|6|Eyes on the Prize}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening_the_Temple_Entrance.png|thumb|left|292x292px|Master and apprentice opening a passage to the Jedi temple on Lothal.]]\nA few days later, Jarrus decided to put Bridger through a test to determine if the boy was meant to be a Jedi or not. Consulting the [[star map]]s in his holocron, he located a [[Lothal Jedi Temple|temple]] on Lothal, but prompted his apprentice to locate the temple by himself. Once he did, they landed the ''Phantom'' and entered the temple. Inside, Jarrus remained behind, waiting for Bridger to come back to the entryway, his life depending on his apprentice's return. Though initially surprised, Jarrus conferred with Yoda about his insecurities as a master. Nevertheless, Bridger returned with a kyber crystal in hand, and Jarrus explained that they were used to construct lightsabers.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\" />\n\nOver the course of several weeks, he helped&mdash;along with the rest of the crew&mdash;Bridger to build [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|his own lightsaber]]. Jarrus provided his Padawan with some of the spare lightsaber parts he had found during his years in hiding. With all of the rebels assembled, the boy presented the weapon to Jarrus, who thought the design fit his apprentice, and returned it so that Bridger could ignite his lightsaber for the first time.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\" />\n\n====Other missions====\nDuring a relief mission for Tarkintown, the ''Ghost'' delivered several crates of [[foodstuff]] to the settlers; unbeknownst to them, the food had been [[poison]]ed by Kallus, prompting those who had eaten to become ill, amongst them [[Mindiz]], for whom Orrelios had a soft spot. Although they were planning to obtain the medicine from Capital City, Orrelios (thinking he had made a mistake) left on his own and prompted the others to go to his help at a medical facility. As they found Orrelios at Kallus' mercy, they intervened (after obtaining an [[antidote]] for the Tarkintown settlers) and engaged in a firefight with Kallus' men. When Kallus tried to attack the weakened Orrelios, Jarrus Force-pushed him and helped Orrelios board the ''Ghost''. Afterwards, they distributed the medicine to the sick and saved them, including Mindiz.<ref name=\"Sabotaged Supplies\">{{SWRMCite|7|Sabotaged Supplies}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, Jarrus accompanied Orrelios and Chopper to Old Jho's Pit Stop, where the Lasat engaged [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] in a game of [[sabacc]]. Believing Orrelios would win, Jarrus allowed him to bet the droid, only to see Calrissian win the game. Because of it, Jarrus made a [[Mission to Lando Calrissian's farm|deal]] with Calrissian to smuggle some cargo past the Imperial [[blockade]] of Lothal. Along with Syndulla, he escorted Calrissian to make a deal with [[Azmorigan]] aboard the ''[[Merchant One]]'', where he reluctantly agreed with Syndulla's decision to stay on Azmorigan's ship. Once she returned, but unable to get past the [[puffer pig]] blocking her way to the [[cockpit]], Jarrus had to pilot the ''Ghost'' through the Imperial blockade and land in [[Lando Calrissian's farm|Calrissian's estate]]. Following a confrontation with Azmorigan's forces, they bid farewell to Calrissian, who had returned Chopper to them.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vision_of_Hope_thumb.png|thumb|right|220px|Jarrus, Bridger, and Syndulla protecting Gall Trayvis.]]\nJarrus later instructed Bridger in an exercise when the boy had a [[Force vision|vision]] revolving around Senator Trayvis. Warning Bridger not to blindly trust his vision, he accompanied the rest of the crew to see the senator's transmission. Though Jarrus suspected something was amiss, he agreed to accompany the crew to the [[Lothal City Capitol Building]] to meet with the senator. They were soon ambushed, however, and had to retreat to the sewers, where they split up&mdash;Jarrus going with Orrelios and Wren, while Bridger, Syndulla and Trayvis went another way. Once they met up, Jarrus used the Force to stop the fan blocking their exit, and the rebels escaped from the Imperials as Trayvis (revealed to be an Imperial spy) regained consciousness. Once the rebels returned to the ''Ghost'', Jarrus explained that Bridger interpreted his vision wrong by allowing his emotions to cloud it.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bridger had a vision of himself attacking Orrelios with his lightsaber three times, he came for advice to Jarrus, but he told him that he did not dwell too much on the vision. Then, Orrelios returned from a meeting with a contact to exchange information, and had learned that the Empire had put a [[bounty]] on their heads. However, Bridger soon discovered that a [[Clawdite]] had infiltrated the ship, prompting a small firefight against the intruder until being stunned by Bridger. In the end, they dropped off the Clawdite on a moon and left.<ref name=\"Ezra's Vision\">{{SWRMCite|8|Ezra's Vision}}</ref>\n\n====Tarkin Arrives====\n{{Quote|Whatever you want from me, you won't get it.|Kanan Jarrus, to Wilhuff Tarkin|Call to Action}}\nAfter a [[Raid near Jalath|raid]] near [[Jalath]], Jarrus, Wren, and Bridger returned to the ''Ghost'' while Syndulla watched as Trayvis publicly proclaimed his loyalty to the Empire on the HoloNet. This, however, gave Jarrus the idea of broadcasting messages through Lothal's [[Imperial Communications Center]]. On their reconnaissance mission to the tower, Jarrus devised a plan with Wren's help, but unbeknownst to them, a [[dwarf probe droid]] warned the recently-arrived [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] of their presence.<ref name=\"Call to Action\">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gunships_fire_on_comm_tower.png|thumb|left|230px|Jarrus watching as Tarkin's orders to destroy the tower are carried out.]]\nThough Bridger voiced his concerns, Jarrus told him he now understood what Billaba had once tried to teach him about sacrifice, and continued with their self-imposed operation. As the crew infiltrated the tower, Jarrus realized the reinforcements were already closing in and made contact with Syndulla to meet them at the top. Despite Bridger's initial refusal to follow Jarrus's orders, he complied when Jarrus told him he would be right behind him, and locked the tower's door once both Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor appeared. At the prospect of losing his crew, Jarrus destroyed the entrance controls with his lightsaber and engaged in a duel with the Pau'an. Unable to reach the ''Phantom'', he ordered Syndulla to leave without him, leading to [[Raid on the communications tower|his capture]] by Imperial forces. At sunrise, during his crew's broadcast, he met Tarkin and witnessed as the Empire destroyed the tower to end the rebels' message.<ref name=\"Call to Action\" />\n\nJarrus was then taken to the ''[[Sovereign]]'', where he was tortured by the Inquisitor,<ref name=\"Rebel Resolve\">{{Rebels|Rebel Resolve}}</ref><ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" /> who wanted to know the location of other Rebel cells and the real identity of \"[[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]],\" but Jarrus revealed nothing before his crew [[Action at Mustafar|rescued]] him. During the interrogation, the Inquisitor taunted Jarrus by asking him how he survived Order 66, and saying that Billaba had given her life for his. When he asked him what his Master's last word was, Jarrus replied that she had told him to run. The Inquisitor then ignited Jarrus' lightsaber and told him that he had the right to be afraid, and that he would be unable to save his crew just as he couldn't save Billaba.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\n====Defeating the Grand Inquisitor====\n{{Quote|That was a mistake.''\"<br />\"''Why?

A fierce duel ensued, then, between Jarrus\u2014who wielded Bridger's lightsaber\u2014and the darksider. During one of their clashes, Bridger pulled Jarrus' lightsaber from the Inquisitor's belt and attempted to help, but his skill was no match for the Inquisitor's level. The Pau'an knocked the young apprentice off the platform, who then dropped his master's lightsaber.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\nInitially shocked and dismayed, Jarrus quickly recovered and dueled the Inquisitor with renewed focus as he remembered his Jedi training and confronted his fear, using both his and Bridger's lightsaber. He managed to destroy [[the Grand Inquisitor's lightsaber]], forcing him to hang on the ledge of the platform, while the pieces of the broken lightsaber fell into the reactor and irreparably damaged it. The darksider then warned Jarrus of things worse than death, before letting go and falling to the ship's exploding reactor. Relieved to discover that Bridger was still alive, the master-Padawan pair left ''Sovereign'' on board [[The Inquisitor's TIE Advanced|the Inquisitor's TIE fighter]], which Jarrus used to shoot the Rebels' TIE-fighter pursuers.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\nIn the ensuing space battle, the rebels had to wait for Chopper to appear with the ''Ghost'' and, to their surprise, a small fleet. Docking the TIE fighters with [[Evac One|Chopper's transport]], Jarrus and the others made the jump to hyperspace, escaping the [[Mustafar system]] and the Imperial fleet. Once inside the transport, Jarrus embraced Syndulla, and together with the rest of the crew, boarded the ''Ghost''. Syndulla then revealed Bail Organa's identity and the existence of other Rebel cells, just before \"Fulcrum\" identified herself as Ahsoka Tano, a former Padawan of the Jedi Order, and mentioned a change of protocol thanks to their message.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\n====More adventures====\n[[File:Senator_Tural_leaves.png|thumb|left|250px|Jarrus, Syndulla, and Bridger see as Senator Tural leaves.]]\nAfter stealing food from an Imperial ship, Syndulla responded to a distress call and rescued [[Thrad]] Senator [[Nadea Tural]] and brought her aboard the ''Ghost'' to treat her injuries, much to Jarrus' dismay. Nevertheless, Jarrus did provide some help when Syndulla tried to make the senator see the truth about the [[Imperial Senate]]'s ineffectiveness, but before long, they were attacked by TIE fighters that took out the ''Ghost''{{'s}} shields and [[hyperdrive]]. They were promptly boarded by Commander [[Earll]]'s forces, who intended to retrieve Senator Tural; they stunned Wren and Orrelios, and Earll herself took Bridger hostage. With no other option, Jarrus, Syndulla and Chopper surrendered, and Earll gave the order to execute them. Tural intervened and impeded Earll from executing them, giving Jarrus time to Force push the stormtroopers around them, knocking them out. While Chopper fixed the hyperdrive and Syndulla prepared to make the jump to lightspeed, Jarrus and Bridger cleared the ship from troopers. The ''Ghost'' escaped then and they managed to drop the Senator off at Camson.<ref name=\"Senate Perspective\">{{SWRMCite|9|Senate Perspective}}</ref>\n\n===The rebellion===\n====Siege of Lothal====\n{{Quote|We are fighting a bigger fight, but it's still the right fight.''\"<br />\"''I survived one war.

However, due to his experiences with the Clone Wars and the Jedi Purge, Jarrus remained apprehensive and disdainful about their involvement with military; following a [[Mission to steal Imperial shield generators|mission]], he even allowed Chopper to relay a message to the ''[[Phoenix Home]]'' from the defecting Minister Tua, who offered Imperial secrets in exchange of passage off Lothal. Following some discussion, they agreed to [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|rescue]] Tua. As he left the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]], Syndulla confronted Jarrus about his breach of protocol earlier, but Jarrus expressed his concern with their involvement in a military operation and suggested that the crew leave the rebellion.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the ''Ghost'' crew traveled to Lothal in a Star Commuter 2000 to avoid detection and headed to rescue her before she boarded the ''Sentinel''-class landing craft that would take her to Grand Moff Tarkin. While Chopper and Orrelios stayed with the commuter, which served as their get-away transport, Jarrus accosted a [[Stormtrooper Commander]], stole his [[Stormtrooper armor|armor]] and infiltrated the Imperials, whereas Syndulla, Bridger and Wren hid to provide covering fire from the surroundings rooftops. As planned, Tua arrived in a [[landspeeder]], but the ''Ghost'' crew was forced to a skirmish, during which they succeeded in freeing Minister Tua, who entered the ''Sentinel''-class shuttle. However, as arranged by Kallus, the shuttle exploded, causing Tua's death, to be used against the rebels.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nWith the failure of their mission (and their commuter being disabled by an AT-DP walker), the ''Ghost'' crew was forced to retreat into hiding in Bridger's former residence. When it was attacked by stormtroopers, they decided to go to the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]] where they deduced Imperial forces were stretched thin due to the manhunt. Jarrus and Bridger, using his disguise as Imperials, transported the other four on crates and infiltrated the [[Imperial Armory Complex]]. Before they could make their escape, [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and his forces attacked them, and Jarrus and Bridger were forced to duel him. The [[Sith Lord]] proved to be more than a match for the two Jedi, but the rebels managed to escape the complex by stealing an Imperial shuttle. However, Vader had staged the entire affair, hoping to track the rebels back to their base of operations. To that end, he had ordered a homing beacon to be placed in the shuttle prior to the confrontation, knowing that the Rebels would have no option but to steal it.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n[[File:The_fall_of_Tarkintown.png|thumb|left|220px|Tarkintown destroyed.]]\nUnable to leave Lothal with the shuttle alone, they contacted Calrissian for help, and he agreed to help them in exchange of three of their stolen [[49-v99 Deflector]]s. When they reached his estate so that Calrissian's droid [[W1-LE]] could help them, Bridger and Jarrus visited Tarkintown, which had been burned and its settlers imprisoned on Vader's orders. When they returned, they found that Wren had programmed several [[masking transponder]]s to replicate their stolen shuttle's signal and to pass through the blockade safely (a journey during which the crew decided to support the wider rebellion) and rendezvous with the Phoenix rebel fleet. However, Vader alone [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|attacked]] with his [[TIE Advanced x1]], causing extensive damage to [[Phoenix Squadron]] and the ''Phoenix Home'', forcing Sato to abandon the ship.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nDuring the space battle, Tano&mdash;who accompanied the ''Ghost'' on its attack against Vader&mdash;sensed Vader's strength in the Force and asked Jarrus to help her in probing their opponent, but she passed out when she realized it could be her old master, Anakin Skywalker.

Aboard their ship, they arrived in the [[Seelos system]]. While Syndulla and Chopper stayed behind to repair the freighter, Jarrus and the others flew down on the ''Phantom'' to [[Seelos]], where they spotted an antiquated [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TE walker]] and approached it, from where they were greeted by three veteran clones\u2014[[Rex]], [[Wolffe]] and [[Gregor]]. While Bridger told Rex that they had been sent by Tano, he was reluctant to join the fight against the Empire, but agreed to put together a list of coordinates of bases and facilities for the rebellion. Meanwhile, Gregor convinced the ''Ghost'' team to help in a [[joopa]] hunt. Before they did so, Bridger told him he thought they could trust the clones, but Jarrus told him of Order 66; however, Rex intervened and countered he and his fellow clones had removed their [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] and disobeyed the order.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, even though they captured \"Big Bongo\" as a team effort, Jarrus was still uncomfortable and contacted Syndulla to discuss his concerns; she encouraged him to give the clones a second chance, pointing out that they had saved millions of lives, including her own. However, Wren discovered that Wolffe had secretly alerted the Empire to their presence and hidden Tano's messages; when confronted, Wolffe admitted his wrongdoing and asserted that he had wanted to protect his fellow clones from the Empire. With the Imperials approaching, Jarrus ordered Wren to contact Syndulla to scan for incoming Imperial vessels. An Imperial [[probe droid]] also damaged the ''Phantom'' before being destroyed by Rex.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\n[[File:Kanan_directs_the_AT-TE.png|thumb|left|250px|Jarrus directs the clones through a sandstorm with the Force.]]\nAfter Wren repaired the ''Phantom'', and they had destroyed a TIE fighter during the Imperial [[Assault on Seelos|assault]], Jarrus and the others made preparations to leave, as Rex had supplied Bridger with the [[datachip]] he had promised them. However, three Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport]]s led by Kallus threatened to shoot them down if the ''Phantom'' took flight and so, Rex directed their AT-TE into the approaching [[sandstorm]]\u2014believing a Jedi would still be able to see through it with the Force. Guided by Jarrus, the clones outmaneuvered the Imperial walkers, while Bridger managed to destroy one of them by shooting at his weak point, the neck, giving them an opening to escape Kallus and the sandstorm. Jarrus and his team then escaped, but Bridger convinced Jarrus to help the clones against the Imperials.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\nWhile Wren handled the controls of the ''Phantom'', Jarrus, Bridger, and Orrelios hijacked one of the AT-AT walkers and used it to immobilize Kallus's walker before it could deliver a final blow against the crippled AT-TE walker. After Kallus and the surviving Imperials fled, the three clones saluted the Jedi for saving them, whereas Rex agreed to join the rebellion and to accompany the rebels back to the Phoenix fleet (while Wolffe and Gregor stayed on Seelos and made the [[Joopa Base|AT-AT their new home]]).<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\" />\n\n====Phoenix fleet====\nDuring a mission to steal intel on [[Sienar Fleet Systems]]' new bombs and updates to their most recent [[TIE line|TIE prototypes]], Jarrus and Orrelios traveled to the planet [[Absanz]] and infiltrated one of the company's [[Sienar Fleet Systems factory|factories]]. In the dark, they made their way through a hangar when [[Dron Ryall]] appeared and told them that security would arrive shortly, but Jarrus and Orrelios forced Ryall to accompany them. However, despite Syndulla's disagreement, they attempted to continue with the kidnapping. As they were attacked, Ryall attempted to escape, prompting Orrelios to grab him once again, while Jarrus cleared the path to an Imperial shuttle. Manning the controls, he took off, with Orrelios and Ryall barely making it to the boarding ramp, until a ''Gozanti'' cruiser attacked. In the ensuing attack, Orrelios was forced to let go of Ryall and had to return to the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Secrets of Sienar\">{{SWRMCite|13|Secrets of Sienar}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Rex's presence would be the cause of many arguments between him and Jarrus, eventually becoming so frequent that the others would try to avoid the two when they happened. One such was when Jarrus attempted to give Bridger a lesson on how to levitate objects by using Chopper, but the astromech and Wren had decided to play a prank on Bridger by locking Chopper's feet to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} metallic floor. The prank prompted the two to argue about discipline\u2014for which Bridger sneaked with Wren, Chopper, and Orrelios on a [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|mission]]\u2014and to play a game of [[dejarik]] that Jarrus won just before they arrived and informed him about the two new Inquisitors sent to hunt them: the [[Seventh Sister]] and the [[Fifth Brother]].<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>\n\nOn another occasion, Jarrus got into another argument with Captain Rex after Bridger had skipped a Jedi lesson to attend one of the Rex's blaster practice. When Jarrus and Rex began to argue about Bridger being a soldier or a Jedi, an exasperated Bridger then responded that he might not wish to be either, much to Jarrus' surprise. Before they could continue the conversation, Jarrus and the rest of the crew (except for Bridger and Chopper) participated in a mission to obtain fuel cells for the people of [[Rinn]], who were experiencing an energy crisis. Later on, Jarrus met [[Hondo Ohnaka]], after he had an [[Skirmish in Nixus Hub 218|adventure]] with Bridger, who told him he wasn't like Ohnaka anymore.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>\n\n====Ibaar====\n{{Quote|We can't beat that blockade, not without a better ship, with better firepower, and the best pilot at the controls.|Kanan Jarrus, to Hera Syndulla|Wings of the Master}}\n[[File:Jun_Sato_and_Quarrie.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jarrus and his comrades with Quarrie following the blockade run on Ibaar.]]\nWhen a mission to bring relief supplies to [[Ibaar]], [[Blockade of Ibaar|blockaded]] by an Imperial fleet commanded by Kallus, ended up on loss of a [[CR90 corvette]] and [[Phoenix Leader (Ibaar)|Phoenix Leader]], Rex suggested that they contact with an [[Mon Calamari]] [[engineer]], [[Quarrie]], who lived on [[Shantipole]] and had developed a prototype blockade buster. During the conference, Jarrus volunteered Syndulla against her will for the mission.

Using the Blade Wing's [[composite-beam laser]], Syndulla destroyed an [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]]. This enabled Jarrus to pilot the ''Ghost'' through the opening in the Imperial blockade and drop the supplies down to the Ibaarians.

Aboard the stolen [[Shuttle S257]], Rex used emergency protocols (much to Jarrus' annoyance) to trick the Interdictor's crew into letting their shuttle board, whereas Jarrus used a mind trick to let them further into the ship. When Chopper learned that Bridger was being transferred to a secure cell, Jarrus and Rex raced to his encounter.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>\n\nWhen they arrived, Bridger mistook them for stormtroopers and shot at them with his lightsaber, [[stun]]ning Jarrus and Rex. When the two recovered, they broke into an argument over how to proceed with their mission, and an exasperated Bridger departed with Chopper to sabotage the ship's [[gravity well projector]]s. Jarrus and Rex, in turn, made it to the detention cell where Commander Sato and his crew were being held. While Rex held off their pursuers, Jarrus entered the cell and freed their comrades, and made their way to Sato's CR90 corvette [[Liberator (CR90 corvette)|''Liberator'']]. However, they were cornered by more stormtroopers. Despite Jarrus's opposition, Rex decided to hold back the Imperials while Jarrus and the other rebels escaped, and Rex was taken prisoner.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\nSensing Rex's distress, Jarrus realized he thought of the clone as a friend and instructed Bridger and Chopper to head back to the corvette while he went back and rescued Rex. Using his disguise, Jarrus infiltrated the Interdictor's command bridge and intervened in Rex's torture by [[Admiral]] [[Brom Titus]]. As Titus escaped, Jarrus and Rex fled the Interdictor aboard an [[escape pod]] and linked it to Sato's corvette. Before long, the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors began to malfunction due to Chopper's sabotage and began pull everything towards itself, including its two escort [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruisers]]. When the Imperial Interdictor and its escorts were destroyed in the ensuing explosion, the rebels managed to escape, and as a result of their joint mission, Jarrus had a newfound respect for Rex, who thanked the Jedi for rescuing him.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\n====Takobo====\n{{Quote|They're Force sensitive.

The three, plus Chopper, traveled on the ''Phantom'' to [[Takobo]]; there, their coordinates led them to a housing unit in the settlement of [[Hammertown]]. While Orrelios and Chopper scanned the spaceport for any sign of the Inquisitors, the master and Padawan traveled to the housing unit, where they an an [[Ithorian]] mother named [[Oora]], whose home had been ransacked by the Inquisitors.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>\n\nJarrus and Bridger promised Oora, who had sent her infant son [[Pypey]] away with a decoy droid, that they would find Pypey before the Inquisitors; he also informed Orrelios of their discovery, and Jarrus was in turn told of the other baby, Alora, and that they had discovered and sabotaged the Inquisitors' TIEs. Then, Jarrus instructed Orrelios to pick Pypey up while Chopper took care of Alora. When the Lasat found Pypey and was cornered by the Inquisitors, Jarrus and Bridger traveled to the apartment complex where Orrelios was hiding and met with him. However, Pypey began to cry after sensing Bridger's fear, and the Inquisitors quickly located them and stabbed their [[Double-bladed spinning lightsaber|lightsabers]] through their room's floor and door. Eluding the Inquisitors, the rebels decided to split up\u2014while Bridger would head into a ventilation shaft with Pypey, Jarrus and Orrelios would hold off the two Inquisitors. When they detected and almost killed Bridger, Jarrus and Orrelios intervened and took on the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother respectively, but were quickly bested by them.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\nLeft with no other choice, they escaped by jumping out of a window and landing on a [[speeder]] by chance, but were promptly followed by the inquisitors who commandeered another speeder. During the chase, Jarrus disabled their ship, but their too was taken down by the Brother's lightsaber. Forced to flee on foot, Jarrus and Orrelios met with Bridger outside the spaceport and, unable to open the gates, they had to face the Inquisitors once again. The Jedi hunters quickly overpowered them, but before they could take the baby, Tano appeared and [[Duel in Hammertown|dueled]] them; under her orders, Jarrus and the other fled aboard the ''Phantom'' with Pypey. Tano managed to defeat them, but she was forced to flee when Imperial reinforcements arrived at the airport. While in hyperspace, they reunited Pypey with his mother, Oora. Tano also revealed to Jarrus that a [[Mission to Mustafar (Skywalker and Tano)|a similar attempt]] to abduct Force-sensitive children had occurred during the Clone Wars.

Seeing his apprehension, the two disclosed what Tseebo had shared about the fate of the Bridgers: they had been imprisoned within a network of Imperial prisons scattered throughout the galaxy, but the rebels were unable to determine which one. Thanks to Commander Sato, they received word that there had been a mass breakout from an Imperial prison on Lothal, and provided a list of prisoners. Jarrus instructed Bridger to locate the truth on the list, and Bridger let the Force single out \"Prisoner X-10.\" Jarrus then offered to accompany him to Lothal.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nShortly thereafter, Imperial forces [[Battle of Garel|launched an attack]] on the Phoenix rebel presence on Garel, prompting Jarrus and Bridger to help Orrelios and Chopper escape a squad of stormtroopers under Kallus' command.

Jarrus then advised Bridger to follow the Force, for which they encountered a white loth-cat that led them to the wilderness. Eventually, they found the loth-cat and a speeder bike, as well as a hooded figure that fired at them. After Bridger managed to placate the stranger by revealing that he was the son of Ephraim and Mira, \"Prisoner X-10\" identified himself as [[Ryder Azadi]]. He explained that the Bridgers had been killed during the [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|escape attempt]] and Bridger told him that he had another vision of his parents, Jarrus taught his Padawan that the Jedi believed that life did not end with death but merely changed form. To comfort Bridger, he told him that his parents would always be with him.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nGiving Bridger some time off, Jarrus contacted Syndulla and told her what had happened; in turn, she informed him that Bail Organa had sent reinforcements: three [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvettes]] for the [[fleet]]. Before leaving, Jarrus tried to convince Azadi to fight the Empire, but when Azadi refused, Jarrus continued with their assignment. They left Chopper behind with the ''Phantom'' to meet with the [[Alderaanian]] delegation at the [[Lothal Depot|depot]] near Jalath. Upon the cruisers' landing, Jarrus and Bridger (disguised again as a stormtrooper and cadet, respectively) received Organa's delegate and daughter, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], whom they escorted and who intended for the Spectres to steal her ships.<ref name=\"Princess on Lothal\">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>\n\nAs Organa spoke to [[Lieutenant]] [[Yogar Lyste]], and saw that [[gravity lock]] were clamped to the relief cruisers to prevent the robbery by Rebel forces, Organa, Jarrus and Bridger used Lyste's shuttle to leave the depot. Chopper then informed that stormtroopers had found him and Azadi, for which Jarrus decided to intervene and save Azadi from execution. So did the ''Ghost'', prompting Jarrus to make it look as if the rebels were taking the princess, himself and the cadet prisoners. When they escaped aboard the ''Ghost'', Jarrus advised Organa (who found herself in a similar position of responsibility as Bridger) to talk with him. Afterwards, when they formulated a plan to [[Mission on Lothal|recover]] the cruisers, Jarrus and Bridger escorted Organa to the depot to distract Lyste while Azadi, Wren and Chopper unlocked the gravity locks and took control of [[P1]], and Syndulla provided air support.<ref name=\"Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nHowever, when the walkers proved resilient to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} armament, Jarrus ordered Bridger to secure [[P2]] while he handled the walker. Jarrus then charged at the tank, ignited his lightsaber and leapt, slicing the walker's left legs. As it fell, he took off in the second cruiser, [[P3]], while Azadi escaped in P2 and Bridger boarded P1 (piloted by Wren). With the ships secure, they met with the Phoenix fleet.<ref name=\"Princess on Lothal\" />\n\n====Trouble at Concord Dawn====\n[[File:Fenn_Rau_captured.png|thumb|right|250px|Kanan captures Fenn Rau and takes him back to the Rebellion.]]\nWith the Empire continuing to hunt down the fledgling rebellion in the Outer Rim, Kanan and several other rebels including Hera, Sabine, Rex, and Commander Sato attended a meeting to discuss opening a new hyperspace route to the [[Lothal sector]]. During the meeting, Sabine suggested the [[Concord Dawn system]], which was home to a Mandalorian colony known as the [[Mandalorian Protectors]]. While Commander Sato advocated sending a military force to deal with the Mandalorians, Kanan and Hera suggested negotiating for safe passage with the Protectors. Despite his reservations, Sato consented to Hera's diplomatic approach.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\">{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Hera's diplomatic mission to the Protectors [[Dogfight over Concord Dawn|failed]] since their leader [[Fenn Rau]] had aligned his warriors with the Empire. Several [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]]s were destroyed during a dogfight above [[Concord Dawn]]. Hera survived but was seriously wounded during the dogfight. Kanan comforted Sabine who blamed herself for Hera's injuries. At a later briefing, Kanan and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' including Ezra, Zeb, and Chopper were present when Sabine recommended a retaliatory military action against the Protectors. Sabine had managed to track down the Protectors' [[Fang-class|Fang fighters]] to a [[Protectors Camp|base]] on the [[third moon of Concord Dawn]]. Kanan suggested infiltrating the base and destroying the starfighters. While Commander Sato approved the mission, Kanan insisted on going solo since he did not want to risk the lives of his crew. Instead, he asked Chopper to come along.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nKanan and Chopper traveled to the Concord Dawn system in the ''Phantom'', the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary ship. Upon arriving, the two discovered that Sabine had stowed aboard, intent on revenge against Fenn Rau. As they approached the third moon, Kanan informed Sabine that he still wanted to negotiate with the Protectors. Upon approaching the moon, Chopper dropped them off near the Protectors camp before flying the ''Phantom'' away from the base. While performing reconnaissance on the outskirts of the camp, Jarrus and Wren discovered that the base housed eight fighters in total, including the ones that attacked Phoenix Squadron. Kanan allowed Sabine to plant explosives on each of them but ordered her to only activate them if diplomacy failed.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nLater, Kanan and Sabine witnessed the arrival of an Imperial landing ship carrying supplies for the Protectors. The two rebels also saw Rau conversing with an Imperial officer and informing him of his encounter with the rebels. Having realized that the Protectors were working for the Empire, Sabine expressed doubts about the success of Kanan's plans. Nonetheless, they proceeded with Kanan's plan to seek diplomacy and only use hostilities as a last resort. While Sabine began planting her explosives, Kanan made his way into Rau's personal quarters and introduced himself to the Protectors' leader.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nIn an attempt to win the Clone Wars veteran over, Kanan introduced himself as a Jedi and explained that he too had fought in the Third Battle of Mygeeto, where he and his master, Depa Billaba, were saved by Rau and Skull Squadron from a Separatist attack. While Rau recalled the battle, he still demanded to know why Kanan was infiltrating his base. Kanan then asked the Mandalorian warrior to join the rebellion but Rau was unwilling to fight against the Empire. In Rau's view, the rebellion had no chance of victory and thus he saw no reason to join a losing side. Despite Kanan's arguments, Rau refused to commit to fighting what he regarded as another losing war with the Jedi.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nKanan's conversation with Rau was interrupted when several Protectors entered the room, reporting that they had captured Sabine and that she had invoked the [[Mandalorian code]] to seek justice through combat. Rau accepted Sabine's challenge since her [[Clan Wren|clan]] was part of [[Clan Vizsla|House Vizsla]], which had sided with the [[Death Watch]], the adversaries of the Protectors during the Clone Wars. Kanan disagreed with Sabine's plan and tried unsuccessfully to convince her to stand down. Sabine responded by telling the Jedi to trust her. During the duel, Sabine shot Rau's [[blaster pistol]] out of his hand and triggered her explosives, destroying seven of the eight Fang fighters.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nHowever, Rau's fighter remained intact and he took it into space to attack the rebel fleet. Using his Force powers, Kanan jumped onto the Fang fighter and managed to hang on to it despite Rau's best efforts to shake him off. Using his lightsaber, Kanan was able to damaged Rau's starfighter and breach the Mandalorian warrior's cockpit. After knocking Rau out, he grabbed the Mandalorian and jumped into the rear entrance of the ''Phantom'', where he was joined by Chopper and Sabine. Having completed their mission to destroy the Protectors' starfighters, the three rebels traveled back on the ''Phantom'' to rejoin the Phoenix fleet.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\nWhile traveling back to the rebel fleet, Rau stirred. Kanan then ordered his captive to contact the Protectors and order them to stand down and to keep his capture a secret from the Empire. Rau also granted the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system. The rebels returned to the fleet with Rau in tow where he was taken into custody. Following their [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]], Kanan and Sabine visited Hera, who was pleased with its outcome.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\n====Journey to Lira San====\n[[File:Fight_in_Nixus_Hub_218.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan and Hera fighting Imperial forces at Nixus Hub 218.]]\nKanan and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' accompanied Ezra to [[Nixus Hub 218]]. Ezra had received a tip about two refugees from his former \"business partner\" Hondo Ohnaka. After arriving in the spaceport, they discovered that the two refugees were Lasat. Imperial troops had also been alerted to their arrival and arrested the refugees. Kanan and his rebel companions quickly intervened to save the Lasat prisoners. During the ensuing melee, Kanan shot one stormtrooper and then held pointed his blaster at the [[Imperial officer|commanding officer]]. Ezra then knocked out the officer by stunning him with his lightsaber.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>\n\nThe rebels discovered that the two Lasat refugees were the former [[Lasan High Honor Guard]]sman [[Gron]] and the mystic [[Chava|Chava the Wise]], who had survived the [[Siege of Lasan|Fall of Lasan]]. Both of them recognized Zeb as a former Captain in the Lasan Honor Guard, something which he had withheld from the other rebels. They were searching for the legendary world of [[Lira San]], which was purported to be a safe refuge for the Lasat. After freeing Gron and Chava, Kanan and his companions made their way back to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} hangar bay but were pursued by stormtrooper reinforcements. During the ensuing blaster battle, Kanan and Hera exchanged fire with the stormtroopers. The rebels managed to make their way back to the ''Ghost'' with the help of Hondo, who sealed several exits which prevented the stormtroopers from apprehending them.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nThe ''Ghost'' then escaped [[Nixus]] and fled into hyperspace. While traveling through space, Chava and Gron began a Lasat ritual designed to reveal Lira San's location since the planet was considered uncharted. Chava believed that Lira San would only be revealed after the \"child of Lasan\" had saved the \"warrior\" and the \"fool.\" Kanan and Chopper watched as the ceremony unfolded while Ezra took part. Disbelieving the [[Prophecy of the Three|prophecy]] and feeling guilt about his failure to stop the Fall of Lasan, Zeb temporarily withdrew but was persuaded to return by Ezra, who convinced him that he had a second chance to save his people.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nAfter Zeb and Ezra returned, Kanan and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' including Hera and Sabine watched the ceremony's proceedings. While Chopper activated a holographic map of [[the galaxy]], Zeb activated his [[bo-rifle]] while Chava ignited her staff. This created an electrical reaction that pointed Lira San's location to a set of coordinates in [[Wild Space]], a region beyond the Outer Rim Territories. The rebels then traveled to Lira San's coordinates but discovered their path blocked by an imploded [[star cluster]]. Their problems were further compounded when Agent Kallus' Imperial light cruiser caught up with them. Kallus issued an ultimatum that the rebels had one minute to surrender before he destroyed the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nFulfilling the ancient Lasat prophecy, Zeb used his bo-rifle to guide the ''Ghost'' through the maelstrom into the star cluster, a feat that was considered suicidal and dangerous. The Imperial light cruiser attempted to follow the rebels but was forced back by the gravitational pull of the star cluster. Believing that the rebels were doomed, Kallus ordered a full retreat. Kanan and Ezra supported Zeb by holding their hands on his back and arms as he guided the ''Ghost'' through the maelstrom. Shortly the ship's hyperdrive kicked in, and the ''Ghost'' jumped to hyperspace. Kanan and the other rebels were knocked out by the bright blast of the star cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nUpon awakening, Kanan and his companions found themselves in unknown space and sighted Lira San in the horizon. Kanan and the other rebels stayed aboard the ''Ghost'' while Zeb, Gron, and Chava traveled down to Lira San in the ''Phantom''. When Zeb returned, Kanan and the other rebels learned that Lira San was the original homeworld of the Lasat species and that it was already home to millions of Lasat. While Gron and Chava had decided to settle on their new homeworld, Zeb returned to his rebel comrades and vowed to bring more Lasat to Lira San. Having discovered a safe route through the star cluster, the crew of the ''Ghost'' then returned into the known galaxy.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\n====Raid on the Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery====\n[[File:Asteroid_Belt_Gas_Refinery.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kanan, the crew and a group of purrgil prepare to attack the Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery.]]\nLater, Kanan and his fellow rebels took part in a [[Heist at the Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery|raid]] on a [[Mining Guild]] [[Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery]] to obtain [[fuel]] supplies for the ''Ghost'' and the Phoenix rebels. On the way, the ''Ghost'' ran into a herd of [[purrgil]]. While Hera wanted to fire on the purrgil, Kanan urged caution while Ezra counselled them to fly the ship in the direction that the purrgil were traveling in. This had the effect of calming the purrgil. Later, Kanan and his fellow rebels came to the aid of the purrgil when two [[TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter]]s strafed the herd. Kanan managed to shoot down the first fighter while his apprentice Ezra shot down the second.<ref name=\"The Call\">{{Rebels|The Call}}</ref>\n\nAs the ''Ghost'' approached the gas refinery, Kanan and his fellow rebels realized that the purrgil were traveling to the same destination. They landed on an asteroid overlooking the Mining Guild refinery. Kanan attended a cockpit briefing where Hera and Sabine outlined their plans to steal several [[Clouzon-36]] canisters from the refinery and destroy the facility in order to deny the Empire access to it. As part of the raid, Kanan along with Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper would jump from the ''Ghost'' into the facility. Prior to the jump, Kanan and the other sentients donned helmets. For this mission, Kanan wore a stormtrooper helmet which had been painted over by Sabine.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nWhile Kanan and the other rebels successfully landed on the bridge, Ezra miscalculated his jump and plummeted into the gassy atmosphere in the [[Unidentified planetoid (Mining Guild)|planetoid]] below. However, Kanan used the Force to lift Ezra out. Shortly thereafter, they were attacked by several Rodian Mining Guild guards. Under Kanan's orders, Sabine activated the detonators, but Ezra convinced her not to do it because the purrgil depended on the gas to survive. Changing their plans, Kanan ordered Ezra to man one of the gun emplacements while the other rebels secured the landing zone for the ''Ghost'' to land.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nAfter the ''Ghost'' landed on the landing zone, Kanan and his companions did their best to hold back the Mining Guild [[Boss]] [[Yushyn]] and his security forces. While the other rebels loaded the fuel canisters onto the ''Ghost'', Kanan leapt on top of the ship and used his lightsaber to deflect laser blasts. A short time later, Ezra was knocked into the abyss below by laser fire. By that stage, Yushyn had managed to surround the rebels with cannons and more guards. Kanan himself was cornered by two more Mining Guild TIE fighters. Yushyn then demanded that the rebels, whom he denounced as thieves, surrender.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nFortunately for Kanan and his companions, they were relieved by Ezra and the purrgil herd. Ezra had managed to make contact with the [[Purrgil King]] and convinced them to work together to defeat the Mining Guild. The purrgil quickly overwhelmed the Mining Guild forces, allowing Kanan and his rebel companions to finish refueling the ''Ghost'' and to flee offworld with the stolen canisters. Before leaving, the ''Ghost'' destroyed the gas refinery, causing it to collapse into the planetoid below. Later in space, Kanan and the other rebels reunited with Ezra, who revealed that the purrgil depended on the gas as nourishment and to travel through hyperspace. The rebels then followed the purrgil on their journey through hyperspace.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\n====Mission to Ryloth====\n[[File:The_crew_of_the_Ghost.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan (third from the right) and his fellow rebels bid farewell to their new Twi'lek allies.]]\nFollowing a raid that ended with the death of the [[starfighter]] pilot [[Phoenix Two]], Kanan and Hera contacted Commander Jun Sato. With the rebels losing starfighters and pilots to the Empire at a faster rate than they could replace, Sato advised the rebels to steal an [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|Imperial fighter carrier]] seen orbiting above [[Ryloth]]. Realizing that they needed help, Hera contacted [[Cham Syndulla]], Syndulla's estranged father and the leader of the [[Free Ryloth Movement|Ryloth rebels]]. Cham agreed to help the Spectres and rendezvoused with the ''Ghost'' in deep space.<ref name=\"Homecoming\">{{Rebels|Homecoming}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the meeting, Kanan was tense about meeting his lover's father and took it out on Ezra. When Cham and his companions [[Numa]] and [[Gobi Glie]] entered the ''Ghost'', Kanan introduced his rebel companions except Chopper. Cham was impressed by the crew of the ''Ghost'', whom he described as a \"fine band\" of rebels. Kanan was present when Hera briefed the two rebel cells about her plan to use a stolen [[TIE/sa bomber]] to infiltrate and hijack the Imperial fighter carrier. However, Cham disagreed with her plan and advocated destroying the ship to demonstrate the Ryloth rebels' strength. In response, Kanan backed up Hera by telling Cham that they needed to put aside their differences and work together to achieve a win-win situation for all.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nCham reluctantly agreed to the plan and the two rebel cells departed on Cham's [[Nu-class attack shuttle|''Nu''-class attack shuttle]]. During the journey, Cham regaled Kanan and his fellow rebels with stories about his exploits during the Clone Wars and the [[Battle of Ryloth|Battle of Lessu]]. Cham's companions Numa and Gobie also befriended the rebels and Kanan seemed taken in by Cham. However, Hera warned him that her father could not be fully trusted. Upon exiting hyperspace, the rebels put their plans into action and departed on their stolen TIE bomber for the fighter-carrier. To get aboard the ship, Hera arranged for two rebel A-wing starfighters to attack their bomber. This fooled the Imperial crew into believing that they were Imperials who had come under attack from rebel forces.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nKanan and the rebels managed to land in one of the fighter carrier's hangar bay. However, Cham and his companions then turned on the Spectres and stunned them. After knocking out Kanan and his companions, the three Ryloth rebels proceeded with their original plan to blow up the fighter-carrier with [[detonator]]s. When Kanan and his fellow rebels awoke, they realized that Cham had betrayed them. Kanan commented that he had been foolish to be taken in by Hera's father. While Zeb and Sabine made their way to the munitions racket to stop Numa and Gobi, Kanan and the other three rebels made their way to the command bridge.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAfter fighting through stormtroopers and dodging blast doors, the four rebels entered the command bridge. There, Ezra used a Jedi mind trick to force the Imperial commander to order a general evacuation of his ship. Soon Kanan and his comrades encountered Cham, who had already sabotaged the ship's hyperdrive. However, Zeb and Sabine had managed to knock out and capture his companions Numa and Gobi. Following a lengthy argument, Hera won over her father and convinced Cham to help them steal the fighter carrier. Putting aside their differences, the two rebel cells rebuffed an attempt by Imperial reinforcements to retake the fighter carrier.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAfter Chopper repaired the hyperdrive and the rebels managed to destroy an Imperial light cruiser, Kanan and the other rebels were able to escape with the stolen fighter carrier into hyperspace. Later, Kanan was present with the other crew when they bid farewell to Cham and his companions. By that time, Hera and Cham had reconciled and come to respect each other.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n====Mission to Geonosis====\n[[File:Kanan_stands_his_ground.png|thumb|250px|right|Kanan holds off a group of stormtroopers aboard the station while Chopper reopens the blast door.]]\nAfter rebel intelligence discovered that the Empire was building [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|something]] above the planet [[Geonosis]], Kanan and his fellow rebels undertook a mission to acquire any information they could find aboard an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]]. While Hera, Rex, and Chopper stayed aboard the ''Ghost'', Kanan along with Ezra, Zeb, and Sabine ventured into the structure. Shortly, they discovered that they had stumbled into a trap set by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the Spectres. Following a struggle, Kanan and his rebel comrades with the exception of Zeb managed to flee aboard the ''Ghost'' into space.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Zeb and his pursuer Kallus ended up in an escape pod which landed on the icy moon of [[Bahryn]]. There, the two nominal adversaries struck an unlikely friendship in order to survive the cold and several [[bonzami]] predators. Back in space, Kanan and his fellow rebels were pursued by several TIE fighters. In an attempt to shake off the Imperials, Hera flew the ''Ghost'' through an Imperial construction module. Kanan then used one of the ship's [[turret]] cannons to shoot down a TIE fighter, causing it to collide with an AT-DP walker.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\nAfter failing to locate Zeb's trajectory, Kanan and Ezra took the ''Phantom'' for a sweep of the planet Geonosis but were unable to pick up Zeb's [[Escape pod transponder|transponder]]. The following day, Zeb managed to repair his transponder and the crew of the ''Ghost'' were able to home in on his location on Bahryn. Kanan and his fellow rebels greeted the Lasat on the ''Ghost'' gangplank before returning to space.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal's temple====\n{{Quote|By the right of the Council, by the will of the Force, Kanan Jarrus, you may rise.\"<br />\"Wait, what does this mean?\"<br />\"You are what I once was: a Knight of the Jedi Order.|Kanan Jarrus and The Sentinel|Shroud of Darkness}}\n[[File:Kanan_vs_the_Sentinel.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan fights a Sentinel in his vision at the Lothal Jedi Temple.]]\nWhile searching for a suitable planet to house the rebellion's base, Kanan and Ezra had another encounter with the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother. After a brief duel, Kanan and Ezra escaped on a tibidee that Ezra was controlling through the Force and once the pair boarded the ''Phantom'', they escaped into space with Chopper. Once in hyperspace, Kanan instructed Hera to rendezvous with them in deep space to avoid exposing the fleet to the Inquisitors. Upon returning to the ''Ghost'', Kanan and Ezra decided to return to the temple on Lothal in order to seek out Master Yoda and find a way to defeat the Empire, due to their previous encounter with the Grand Master in the same location. The two Jedi arrived on Lothal in the ''Phantom'' accompanied by Ahsoka Tano, who was conducting her own investigation into the Sith Lord [[Darth]] Vader.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>\n\nWhile meditating in the temple, Kanan entered a vision in which he saw a [[Jedi Temple Guard]] known as the Sentinel within a dojo. The Sentinel warned Jarrus that Bridger would fall to the dark side of the Force and that the boy had to be eliminated. Grabbing another lightsaber off the wall, Jarrus refused and engaged him in a lightsaber duel, holding off the Sentinel and two other guards. By the end of the duel, Jarrus refused to fight any further and admitted that while he may not be able to protect Bridger forever, he would continue to do his best to train him. The Sentinel looked as if he was about to strike Jarrus down, but instead [[Knighting ceremony|knighted]] him and removed his mask to reveal the face of the Grand Inquisitor.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n[[File:Knighthood_AoN.png|thumb|250px|right|The Sentinel knights Kanan a Jedi Knight before revealing himself to be the Grand Inquisitor.]]\nJarrus asked what everything that had happened meant, and the Sentinel said that it meant Jarrus was now a Jedi Knight, as he himself used to be. As the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother entered the temple, the Sentinel told Jarrus to flee and said he would hold off the enemy. Jarrus, Bridger, and Tano managed to escape the temple and return to the ''Phantom''. Safe for the moment, Ezra revealed he had spoken to Yoda and that he had been told to find [[Malachor]]. Ahsoka explained that Malachor was not a person, as Ezra assumed, but a place.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n====Heist at Horizon Base====\nWith the Phoenix Squadron's former Imperial fighter carrier lacking sufficient fuel supplies to travel to the [[Yost system]] to set up a base, Kanan and his companions instead took part in a [[Heist at Horizon Base|mission]] to steal fuel from the Imperial fuel depot at [[Horizon Base]]. Upon landing, Kanan and his fellow rebels headed to the fuel depot while Chopper stayed behind to guard the ''Ghost''. As they approached the depot, the rebels found it heavily guarded. Kanan told his rebel companions to get the fuel \"quietly with no complications.\" Despite Kanan's warning, the rebel heist attracted the attention of Imperial forces, who chased them back to the ''Ghost''. Despite making it back safely, they were forced to leave Chopper behind since the droid had become distracted by an [[Ambulatory strut|droid leg]] on sale at a nearby stall.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>\n\nKanan and his fellow rebels traveled back to the fleet only to find it under attack from Imperial forces under Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]], who gave orders that the ''Ghost'' not be allowed to reach the fighter carrier. Fortunately for Kanan and his team, Sabine's friend [[Ketsu Onyo]] used her starship ''[[Shadow Caster]]'' to shield the rebels from enemy fire. This allowed the rebels to unload refuel the fighter carrier. The rebels aborted their trip to the Yost system after receiving information from Chopper and the former Imperial [[inventory droid]] that the Empire had set a trap there. Instead, AP-5 and Chopper relayed the coordinates for [[Atollon]], a world lacking an Imperial presence. Kanan and the rest of the rebel fleet managed to flee there.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nAfter arriving above Atollon, Kanan and Hera checked the coordinates and found that the world was indeed devoid of any Imperial presence. The rebels were also rejoined by Chopper and AP-5, who had stolen an [[Class four container transport|Imperial cargo ship]]. Kanan and the other rebels were present when Sabine repaired AP-5, who had been shot by an [[Unidentified Imperial cargo ship captain|Imperial officer]] during the heist of the fighter carrier. Chopper sacrificed his stolen droid leg to provide Sabine with the necessary parts to repair AP-5. Kanan and the other rebels watched in shock and bemusement when AP-5 chided Chopper for the \"illogical act\" of sacrificing his stolen droid leg. When Chopper responded with a string of expletives, AP-5 replied in turn.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\n====Preparing for the journey====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_lightsaber_practice.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan and Ezra sparring with their lightsabers on a low-power setting.]]\nFollowing the discovery of Atollon, the Phoenix rebels established a base on the planet called [[Chopper Base]]. The crew of the ''Ghost'' assisted with the establishment of the base by ferrying supplies. During one such supply run, Kanan took the opportunity to have a lightsaber training session with Ezra. The lightsaber session ended in a draw with Ezra pointing his blade at Kanan's neck and Kanan pointing his blade at Ezra's chest. When Ezra remarked that they won by killing Inquisitors, Kanan replied that they won by surviving. Shortly, Hera and Sabine arrived from the cockpit to watch the session. After a brief chat, the two Jedi continued their sparring.<ref name=\"Mystery\">{{Rebels|The Mystery of Chopper Base}}</ref>\n\nAfter landing at Chopper Base, Kanan tried to make conversation with Hera, but she was still upset about his and Ezra's plans to depart with Ahsoka for the planet Malachor. Later that day, Kanan managed to talk with Hera. While she was still uneasy about their travel plans, Kanan stressed that the Jedi had to visit Malachor in order for the rebellion to succeed. Kanan and the other Spectres subsequently responded to a distress call from Sabine and Rex, who had come under attack from several spider-like predators called [[krykna]]. Earlier, Sabine and Rex had visited the northern perimeter to search for Lieutenant [[Dicer]], who had disappeared while planting a [[sensor beacon]] there.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nThe rebels managed to save Sabine from the krykna, but Rex was taken captive by the creatures. Kanan and his fellow rebels entered the krykna's underground lair to rescue their rebel comrade. Under Hera's orders, Kanan and Ezra split up from the main group and searched a different part of the tunnels. Hera wanted the other rebels to get used to working without their Jedi comrades. Shortly, Kanan and Ezra encountered a krykna. After Ezra failed to establish a Force connection with the creature, Kanan slew the spidery creature with his lightsaber. When Ezra protested, Kanan chided his apprentice for his lack of common sense.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\n[[File:Kanan_and_Hera_farewell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kanan sees Hera for the last time, as he bids her farewell before the journey to Malachor.]]\nKanan and Ezra subsequently managed to reunite with their rebel comrades, who had freed Rex. Following a skirmish with the krykna, they managed to flee back to the ''Ghost''. The rebels attempted to flee on the ''Ghost'' but the krykna spun a large web around the starship, preventing their escape. When the krykna tried to storm the ship, Kanan along with Ezra and Zeb used the ship's laser cannons to blaste the intruders. Kanan and Ezra later assisted Sabine's escape plan which involved recovering the sensor marker and slashing through the krykna's web. As part of the plan, Kanan and Ezra used their Force powers to hurl Sabine towards the sensor marker. While Sabine distracted the krykna with the sensor marker, Kanan and Ezra managed to free the ship from the krykna's web with their lightsabers.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nAfter escaping the krykna, Kanan supported Hera's call to maintain the rebel base on Atollon and came up with a plan to hold the krykna at bay by constructing a fence consisting of several sensor markers. The following day, Sabine told Kanan that Hera wanted to speak to him. She explained that Hera was supportive of their mission to Malachor but feared that she would never see him or Ezra again. When Kanan tried to reassured Hera, she told him that she preferred that they face their challenges together. Before leaving for Malachor, Kanan promised Hera that they would see each other again before hugging her.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\n====Mission to Malachor====\n[[File:The_temple.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan, Ezra, and Ahsoka find a Sith Temple in the depths of Malachor.]]\nArriving on Malachor, Kanan, Ezra and Ahsoka explored the ruins surrounding a [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] beneath the planet's surface when they were attacked by the [[Eighth Brother]]. The fight caused Ezra to fall to another level of the ruins, and he told the others to pursue the Inquisitor, claiming he would find them. Kanan and Ahsoka pursued the Eighth Brother to his TIE fighter when Chopper, defying orders to stay at the ''Phantom'', appeared and commandeered the vehicle, forcing him to surrender. The temple soon began to light up, and Kanan, deducing Ezra was responsible, escorted the handcuffed Inquisitor to the temple's entrance.<ref name=\"Twilight\">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>\n\nThere, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother attacked Kanan and freed their comrade. During the duel, Ezra emerged from the temple with none other than [[Maul]], the one whom the Eighth Brother had been hunting. Maul activated his [[Maul's lightsaber|double-bladed lightsaber]] and demonstrated his prowess against the Inquisitors, forcing them to retreat. Revealing they had recovered a [[Sith holocron]], Ezra convinced Kanan and Ahsoka to trust Maul, who was no longer a Sith Lord and had a mutual enemy in the Empire. As they climbed the temple, Maul advised they split up to divide the Inquisitors' attention, and Kanan reluctantly agreed Ezra go with Maul to help him ascend the pyramid.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nKanan and Ahsoka fought the Fifth and Eighth Brothers, while Maul and Ezra engaged and killed the Seventh Sister. Maul descended and killed the Fifth Brother, while Kanan damaged the Eighth Brother's lightsaber, causing him to be killed when he attempted to use its rotor function to flee. Kanan asked where Ezra was, which prompted Maul to reply by burning out the Jedi's eyes with his lightsaber. As he dueled Ahsoka, Maul revealed he had sent Ezra up to activate the temple, which was actually a [[battle station]] that he would strike with at all his enemies. As Ezra unwittingly used the holocron to activate the temple's [[Malachor superweapon|superweapon]], Kanan found his dropped lightsaber and donned an ancient Jedi Temple Guard helmet, and ordered Ahsoka to leave and find Ezra. Relying on the Force and his other senses, the blind Jedi grabbed Maul's arm and, coupled with the surrounding statues, threw him off the pyramid.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n[[File:InfuseTheForce-CM.png|thumb|right|220px|Together, Ezra and Kanan remove the holocron from the obelisk.]]\nChopper came and helped Kanan reach the top of the pyramid, where Ahsoka was engaged in combat with Vader. He and Ezra used the Force to remove the holocron, causing the pyramid to seal itself. Vader tried to pull Ezra towards him, but Ahsoka struck at his helmet and pushed Kanan's apprentice into the ''Phantom''. As Chopper flew the shuttle out, the temple's pyramid sealed itself and the [[superweapon]] overloaded and exploded. Kanan embraced Ezra, who mourned the loss of Ahsoka. When they returned to Atollon, Hera examined Kanan's eyes, now concealed by a white wrap, and hugged him.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n====Rescuing the Argora====\n{{Quote|The Force is known by many names across the galaxy. Some people are more attuned to the Force than others. Why not some animals, too?|Kanan Jarrus|Endangered, Part 2}}\nKanan and the Spectres took the ''Phantom'' and boarded a [[Class four container transport|Class ''four'' Imperial transport]] bound for the [[Emperor's personal zoo]]. Their mission was to retrieve the [[Argora]] and return it to [[Xendek]]. Kanan and the others were able to board the transport and fought the stormtroopers. Kanan found out that they got their information from Hondo. Kanan told Hondo that the bird was leaving with the Spectres, not Hondo. Unfortunately, Hondo released the other creatures aboard the transport.<ref name=\"Endangered\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=7|story=[[Endangered, Part 1]]}}</ref>\n\nKanan and the Spectres were confronted by the creatures. After evading the creatures, Kanan, Sabine and Zeb fought more stormtroopers as they pursued Hondo and the Argora. Kanan protected both the other Spectres and the creatures from Captain [[Zarda]] and Dr. [[Hazlekk]]'s stormtroopers blaster fire. After defeating the troopers, Kanan was able to use the Force to calm the creatures. Kanan had the creatures attack Zarda, Hazlekk and their remaining stormtroopers. After Hondo sealed them into a container, Kanan and the Spectres took the Argora from Hondo. Kanan, and the Spectres returned the Argora to Xendek.<ref name=\"Endangered 2\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=8|story=[[Endangered, Part 2]]}}</ref>\n\n====Encountering Bendu====\n[[File:Bendu_and_the_blind_man.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan meets [[Bendu]].]]\nWhile his apprentice Ezra and the other rebels attended a briefing on the upcoming [[Mission to Reklam Station|mission]] to [[Reklam Station]], Kanan went to meditate at the outskirts of Chopper Base. He then heard a voice crying out to him from the wilderness. Hera then came up from behind and told Kanan that she had expected to see him at the briefing. When Hera told Kanan that Ezra blamed himself for the events of the previous mission to Malachor, Kanan reassured her that he held no ill will towards Ezra. Later, Kanan entered Ezra's room aboard the ''Ghost'' and caught his apprentice dabbling with the Sith holocron he had obtained on Malachor. An argument broke out with Kanan chastising his apprentice for dabbling with the dark side. When Ezra insisted that he was using the Sith holocron for good, Kanan responded that acting out of anger led to the dark side. After Kanan confiscated the holocron, Ezra stormed out the room but not before telling him that he did not need him or the holocron.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nAfter Ezra and his team had left, Kanan was led into the wilderness by the voice. He soon discovered that the voice belonged to a mysterious Force wielder called [[Bendu]], who characterized himself as standing in the middle of the Ashla and the Bogan, the light side and the dark side. After identifying himself as a Jedi Knight, Kanan confided his fears that his apprentice was turning to the dark side. After Kanan showed him the Sith holocron, Bendu explained that an object could be used for both good and evil but that the person had the power to choose for themselves. Bendu then took an interest in Kanan's sensor beacon and destroyed the machine. When Kanan protested, Bendu explained that he would never regain his sight but that he could teach him to use his other senses.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nBendu then instructed Kanan to empty his mind and to turn around and walk forwards. Kanan was soon surrounded by two krykna, who did not attack him. When Kanan confided that his first encounter with the creatures had been influenced by their smell, the Bendu counseled him that he was not looking at the krykna for what they were. Kanan began making peace with the krykna but he then sensed that Ezra was in danger and ignited his lightsaber, startling the creatures. At that point, Kanan realized that the krykna had been hostile because they had been feeding of his fears and anxieties. When Kanan concluded that he had isolated himself from everyone and the Force, Bendu told him that he had regained his connection to the Force. Before leaving, Kanan left the Sith holocron with Bendu as a gift.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nKanan later joined Hera in the ''Ghost''. Together, they traveled to Reklam Station, where they rescued Ezra from falling into the depths of the gassy planet of [[Yarma]]. After evacuating the rest of the team and the stolen [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wings]], Kanan and the Spectres returned to Chopper Base. Following the debriefing, Ezra apologized to his master for using the Sith holocron. When Ezra asked Kanan what he did with it, the older Jedi told him that it was in safe hands but did not mention the Bendu. When Ezra thanked his master for saving him, Kanan replied that he would always come back and the two reconciled.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n====The two holocrons====\n[[File:Kanan_Jarrus_sucked_into_space.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kanan being sucked out through the airlock.]]\nWhile traveling with Ezra on a Phoenix rebel corvette, Kanan and his apprentice debated the merit she of using the Sith holocron and the recent events on Malachor. Upon exiting hyperspace, the rebels discovered one of their Hammerhead corvettes. After receiving no response, Ezra and Kanan boarded the ship. They quickly discovered that the ship had been attacked by a red blade, which they initially assumed belonged to another Inquisitor. One of the surviving crew informed the Jedi that the ''Ghost'' was in danger.<ref name=\"Holocrons\">{{Rebels|The Holocrons of Fate}}</ref>\n\nKanan and Ezra made contact with the ''Ghost'' only to discover that Hera, Chopper, Zeb, and Sabine had been taken prisoner by Maul and his repurposed [[RIC-1200|tour-guide droids]]. Maul demanded that the two Jedi hand over the Sith holocron and Kanan's Jedi holocron. If they refused, he threatened to kill their friends. Kanan expressed annoyance that his apprentice had told Maul about his Jedi holocron during his earlier encounter on Malachor. When Ezra asked him about the Jedi holocron, Kanan explained that the holocron was safe but that retrieving it would not be straight forward.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nKanan and Ezra returned to Atollon and traveled on a [[Kanan's Joben T-85 speeder bike|speeder bike]] to the lair of Bendu. The two did not find Bendu but found themselves surrounded by several krykna. Despite Kanan's attempts to calm Ezra, the apprentice ignited [[Ezra's second lightsaber|his green lightsaber]]. Before further trouble could arise, Bendu intervened and startled the krykna. When Bendu asked why they had come, Kanan apologized that they could not stay long and nudged Ezra to tell Bendu the purpose of their meeting. Ezra explained their predicament with Maul and the Sith holocron while Kanan added that the former Sith also wanted his Jedi holocron.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nBendu warned that the [[Holocron fusion|convergence]] of the holocrons would provide clarity but could also lead to chaos. After some discussion, he allowed Ezra to recover the holocron but told the apprentice that he needed to travel into a cave full of krykna to retrieve it. Knowing Ezra's dislike of the creatures, Kanan instructed Ezra to leave behind his lightsaber and to keep in touch by comlink. When Bendu asked Kanan why, the Jedi Knight explained that Ezra needed to learn how to resolve problems without resorting to violence.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nKanan used the comlink to guide Ezra but lost contact with him. The master entered the cave to help his apprentice. Kanan managed to use the Force to reason with the krykna and convince them that he and his apprentice were not threats. After reuniting with Ezra, the two reconciled with Kanan reassuring Ezra that he was not to blame for the recent events. He also counselled Ezra to forgive himself and the two embraced. Under Kanan's guidance, Ezra used the Force to levitate the Sith holocron from a chamber full of krykna. After returning, Bendu commended the master and apprentice for restoring balance to their relationship. However, he warned them that Maul would force one of them to open the Jedi holocron.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nTogether, Kanan and Ezra traveled on an A-wing starfighter to their prearranged rendezvous point, the Mandalorian asteroid Station [[Vizsla Keep 09]]. During the journey, Kanan told his apprentice that they would let the Force guide their rescue mission. Upon arriving, the two were greeted by Maul. Satisfied that the Jedi had met his terms, he sent two tour droids to guide Ezra to the command center. Maul then led Kanan to the airlock. On the way, Maul apologized to Kanan for blinding him before making a second attempt on his life. Maul pushed Kanan into the airlock but the Jedi managed to use the Force to leap back into the station's hangar bay.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nKanan then made his way into the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo hold and destroyed Maul's tour guide droids before they could execute Hera, Chopper, Zeb, and Sabine. Together, they made their way to the command center where Maul and Ezra had combined the two holocrons. Despite the room being bathed in a bright pink glow of light, Kanan managed to sense Ezra and convince his apprentice to end the ritual. The holocrons quickly separated with an explosion and deactivated. Maul took advantage of the chaos to escape into hyperspace. Kanan attended to his unconscious apprentice. When Ezra awoke, Kanan reassured Ezra that together they would discover the secrets of the holocrons.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\n====Rescuing defectors====\n[[File:FulcrumContact-TAA.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan attending a briefing following the loss of a rebel convoy.]]\nAfter Imperial forces [[Massacre near Teralov|attacked]] a rebel convoy near Teralov, Kanan and his fellow rebels attended a briefing chaired by Commander Sato. During the meeting, the rebels learnt that a rebel agent known as Fulcrum had information of Imperial cadets from the elite [[Skystrike Academy]] who wanted to defect to the rebellion. Hera assigned Sabine on an [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|undercover mission]] to extricate the cadets. Kanan along with his apprentice Ezra and Chopper were assigned to a CR90 corvette that was tasked with rescuing Sabine and her team.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\">{{Rebels|The Antilles Extraction}}</ref>\n\nWhen they received confirmation that Sabine had managed to infiltrate the Academy, Kanan assured Ezra that Sabine was capable of looking after herself. When Sabine and the defecting cadets [[Wedge Antilles]], [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]], and [[Rake Gahree]] tried to escape, Kanan and Ezra attempted to rendezvous with them. However, Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] deactivated the TIE fighters' [[solar collector]]s and sent [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptors]] to attack the rebel corvette. Despite Ezra's protests, Kanan ordered Chopper to evacuate the ship into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nDespite Sabine's orders to evacuate, Ezra and Kanan kept their ship nearby in the event that Sabine and the other cadets managed to escape. The rebels' corvette managed to evacuate the cadets' stolen TIE bomber. Kanan was present on the bridge when Sabine, Wedge, and Hobbie came aboard. They then fled into hyperspace. Kanan was later present at Chopper Base when Commander Sato formally welcomed Wedge and Hobbie into the rebellion.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n====Return to Ryloth====\n[[File:Rebels_and_Rex_part_as_friends_with_Kalani.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The rebels part as friends with Kalani.]]\nLater, Kanan and the other Spectres returned to Ryloth to deliver supplies to Cham, the leader of the Free Ryloth movement. After rescuing Cham and another rebel Numa from an Imperial patrol, Kanan attended a briefing where Cham outlined the military advances made by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] in the [[Tann Province]]. Kanan and all of the other rebels also volunteered to help Hera recover a valuable family heirloom, the [[Kalikori]], from Imperial forces who had set up base at the [[Syndulla residence]].<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>\n\nWhile Hera, Ezra, and Chopper infiltrated the Syndulla residence, Ezra, Cham, and the other rebels staged a diversionary attack on Imperial forces in the [[Tulara Ravine]]. The rebels managed to destroy an Imperial Troop Transport and an AT-DP walker. The rebels then retreated but were pursued by a second AT-DP walker. The rebels were forced to dig in as a gun battle unfolded. A ceasefire occurred when Thrawn's second in command Captain [[Slavin]] contacted Cham via a hologram projector and informed the rebels they had captured Hera and Ezra. He demanded that Cham surrender himself in return for the safe return of his daughter and Ezra.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nAt dawn, the Spectres and Cham's team arrived on the ''Ghost'' at the Syndulla residence to facilitate the exchange. Kanan accompanied Cham down the forward ramp of the ship. Before the exchange could take place, Hera ordered Chopper, who had evaded capture, to detonate several explosives which devastated the Syndulla home. With the Imperials momentarily distracted, the rebels made their escape. While fleeing, Kanan used his lightsaber to deflect a rocket back at an AT-DP walker, toppling it to the ground. After escaping into the wilderness, Kanan and Hera had a private chat with Cham where Hera emphasized her love for Kanan, her father, and her crew. She emphasized that she did not need the Kalikori when she still had a family.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n====Relics of the Clone Wars====\nAfter the events on Ryloth, Kanan joined Ezra, Zeb, Chopper and Rex on a [[Mission to Agamar (2 BBY)|mission]] to salvage [[proton bomb]]s from a wrecked [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship]] on the planet [[Agamar]]. After Hera and Sabine departed, Kanan accompanied the other rebels and Rex as they explored the wreckage. When Rex snapped at Ezra for making light of the danger of the B1 battle droids, Kanan reassured his apprentice that Rex was still deeply affected by the Clone Wars. The rebels apart from Chopper quickly stumbled upon a munitions depot stacked with proton bombs. However, they were captured in a Separatist [[ray shield]] by several battle droids led by [[B1-268]], who received orders to stun the prisoners.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kanan awoke, he had to reassure Rex that he was not in the Clone Wars. Kanan and his fellow rebels then found themselves prisoners of the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] [[Kalani]], who had countermanded the shut-down order that accompanied Order 66. He still had scores to settle with the clones and Jedi and forced Kanan, Rex, and Ezra to participate in a simulated war match. Rex and Kanan objected but Ezra convinced his comrades to participate in the match in order to free Zeb, who had been designated a hostage, and to obtain the proton bombs. Kalani agreed to Ezra's terms and made preparations for the battle. Kanan and the other rebels were instructed to advance towards the command bridge in order to rescue Zeb.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nDuring the combat match, Kanan and Ezra allowed Rex to take charge. Kanan and his apprentice Ezra used the Sword and Shield maneuver to shatter the advancing battle droids and to force their way to the hangar. Inside the hangar, they were ambushed by several [[droideka]]s. While Kanan and Rex provided covering fire, Ezra advanced forwards to collapse the catwalk on the droids. Ezra was delayed by a chance encounter with Chopper, who had sent a distress transmission and discovered a [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|Neimoidian escort shuttle]]. While exchanging fire with battle droids, Rex was hit and Kanan attended to his comrade. Fortunately, Rex survived due to his protective armor. After collapsing the catwalk with the Force, Ezra rejoined Kanan and Rex. When Rex chastised Ezra for the delay, Kanan reassured his apprentice that Rex was determined to end the battle.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nAfter knocking out another droideka, Kanan and his fellow rebels forced their way into Kalani's command center. However, Kalani refused to accept defeat on technical grounds and threatened to execute Zeb. Before further hostilities could break out, Ezra managed to convince Kalani and Rex that trying to win the battle was futile since their true enemy was the Galactic Empire. Ezra reasoned that the Empire was the enemy of the Separatists since it was the successor to the Republic. Kalani saw reason after Imperial forces landed and attacked a battle droid patrol led by B1-268. The rebels and Kalani then joined forces to escape Agamar. Under Kalani's direction, Kanan and Ezra deflected blaster bolts fired by his battle droids at several proton bombs, which had been rolled towards the advancing [[All Terrain Armored Transport (original)|AT-AT]] and AT-DP walkers. The blasts ignited several of the bombs which succeeded in taking out one of the AT-ATs.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nThe rebels and droids then took their chance to escape aboard three Neimoidian escort shuttles. While one of the shuttles was shot down, the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles managed to escape into space. Once in space, Kanan listened as Rex and Kalani praised Ezra for ending the Clone Wars. Believing that the rebels had a poor chance of success against the Empire, Kalani and his remaining droids elected to depart into space. Later, Kanan and his crew were contacted by Hera, who asked them about the progress of their salvage mission. Despite failing to obtain the proton bombs, the rebels managed to obtain a [[Phantom II|new transport]] for the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\n====Trouble on Concord Dawn====\nKanan Jarrus later attended a briefing in the war room of a rebel CR90 corvette. Hera Syndulla and Commander Sato had convened the briefing to discuss the rebels losing contact with the Protectors of Concord Dawn. Earlier, Fenn Rau had given the rebels permission to travel through the Concord Dawn system in order to avoid Imperial sector patrols. Hera summoned Fenn Rau and Sabine to inquire into the matter. When Zeb asked whether Rau was their prisoner, Kanan clarified that he was a \"grumpy house guest.\" Hera dispatched Rau, Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper on a [[Second mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]] to the third moon of Concord Dawn to investigate. There, they discovered that the Imperial [[Viceroy]] [[Gar Saxon]] had attacked and wiped out the Protectors. As a result, Fenn decided to join the rebellion once and for all.<ref name=\"ISC\">{{Rebels|Imperial Supercommandos}}</ref>\n\n====Evacuation of Mykapo====\nKanan and his fellow Spectres later assisted the Phoenix Squadron in the [[Skirmish over Mykapo|evacuation]] of rebel sympathizers from the planet [[Mykapo]]. While Hera attempted to convince members of a local rebel cell called the [[Iron Squadron]] to leave the system before Imperial reinforcements arrived, Kanan and Zeb assisted with Rex's evacuation efforts in the shuttle ''Phantom II''. After evacuating, the rebels rendezvoused with the fleet while Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper tried to reason with Iron Squadron. Ezra and his team managed to convince the Squadron members [[Gooti Terez]], [[Jonner Jin]], and [[R3-A3]] to evacuate but were forced to leave the captain [[Mart Mattin]] behind after he tried to attack Imperial forces under Admiral Konstantine.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>\n\nKanan was present during a hologram briefing in which Hera and the other rebels resolved to rescue Mart. During the rescue mission, Kanan manned the ''Ghost'' top turret cannons and destroyed several TIE fighters. After rescuing Mart and his ship ''[[Sato's Hammer]]'', the rebels escaped with the help of Commander Sato. Kanan was later present at Chopper Base when Commander Sato reunited with his nephew Mart and Mart embraced his crew.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n====Mission to Wynkahthu====\nLater, Kanan and his fellow rebels reluctantly agreed to help the pirate Hondo and his business partner Azmorigan retrieve cargo from a stricken Imperial cargo ship in the stormy upper atmosphere of the planet [[Wynkahthu]]. While Kanan and Hera distrusted Hondo, they agreed to help after learning that the ship contained proton bombs, a commodity desired by the rebellion. When Hera appointed Zeb in charge of the mission, Kanan agreed with Hera's assessment that Hondo could not be trusted but still opined that his apprentice Ezra needed to experience it for himself.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>\n\nFor the duration of the [[Mission to loot an Imperial cargo ship|mission]], Kanan stayed with Hera aboard the ''Ghost''{{'s}} bridge. He was alarmed when [[AP-5]] had a 38.5% chance of success due to the windy and stormy conditions on Wynkahthu. Kanan and Hera kept in touch with the rebels and their confederates via comlink. Despite the windy conditions, the salvage team led by Zeb managed to enter the cargo ship and open its outer doors to allow the ''Ghost'' to reach the ship. The salvage team then used grappling guns to transfer the proton bombs and treasure aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nDespite encountering opposition from several [[DT-series sentry droid]]s, Zeb's salvage team managed to accomplish their mission. Using the Force to guide him, Kanan also helped pull Zeb and Ezra aboard the ship after the cable snapped. The rebels then departed on the ''Ghost'' as the cargo ship was ripped apart by the vortex. Once aboard, Kanan was present when the other rebels examined their loot. He was also present when Hondo discovered that his surviving [[Ugnaught]] crew member [[Melch]] had stowed aboard one of the crates.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\n====Undercover on Lothal====\n=====Infiltrating the Imperial armory=====\nAfter the Phoenix Squadron received intelligence that the Empire was developing a new weapon at the Imperial Armory Complex, the Squadron dispatched Kanan, his apprentice Ezra, and Chopper to solicit the help of Azadi's [[Lothal resistance group|rebel cell]] in taking out the factory. Kanan and his team landed in Capital City and rendezvoused with Ryder. Fleeing on his landspeeder, Kanan and Ezra managed to use their lightsabers to topple an AT-DP walker. They then managed to outrun two defective [[614-AvA speeder bike]], which overheated and exploded.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\">{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}</ref>\n\nAt Ryder's hideout, Kanan and Ezra learnt that Ryder's cell was sabotaging vehicles produced at the Lothal Imperial factory. After discussing their plans, Morad agreed to help Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|infiltrate]] the factory. Kanan and Ezra donned factory uniforms while Chopper was disguised as an [[R4 courier droid|Imperial courier droid]]. At the factory, the workers were summoned for an assembly where Grand Admiral Thrawn berated the workers for their shoddy workmanship. As a deterrent, he forced Morad to ride a defective 614-AvA speeder bike, which exploded and killed Sumar.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nWhen Thrawn ordered his subordinates to question the workers, Kanan and his apprentice slipped away with the help of Chopper, who staged a distraction. However, Kanan lost contact with Ryder since the Imperials were jamming their signals. Master and apprentice then managed to knock out and steal the uniforms of a stormtrooper and scout trooper. The three rebels then made their way to Section A2, where Morad believed that the secret plans were stored. Since Thrawn had stationed sentries outside the chamber which only admitted individuals carrying clearance codes, Kanan stopped a courier droid. Chopper then electrocuted the droid and stole its clearance code.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nWhile Kanan and Ezra waited for Chopper to return, they were confronted by a stormtrooper corporal and his men, who noted that the two were outside of their territory. At that point, Chopper exited the chamber Despite Ezra's efforts to bluff the corporal by claiming they were in the wrong section, the corporal did not believe them and the rebels were forced to flee into a turbolift. There, they encountered their perennial adversary Agent Kallus, who recognized the two rebels and their droids.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n=====The unlikeliest ally=====\nBelieving Kallus to be a foe, Kanan and Ezra engaged in a fist fight with the ISB agent. However, Kallus managed to convince them that he was Fulcrum by repeating the code phrase \"by the light of Lothal's moons.\" While Chopper trusted Kallus, Ezra was suspicious. Seeking to test Kallus, Kanan tasked the ISB agent with helping them gain access to a com station. Using their lightsabers and blasters, Ezra and Kanan managed to knock out the stormtroopers guarding the station. Kallus then helped Kanan to upload his comlinks from this port.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nKanan managed to contact Ryder, who informed him that his team was ready to attack the east gate. Kallus then advised the rebels to steal an AT-DP walker and escape through the east gate. When Ezra flung Kallus through a glass monitor to convince the Empire that he had put up a fight, Kanan chided his apprentice for beating him to the game. However, Ezra replied that Kanan would get another chance. The three rebels managed to escape in an AT-DP walker through the east gate just as Ryder attacked the factory. However, the Empire deployed two AT-AT walkers against Ryder's forces.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nThrawn then realized that Kanan's team had hijacked an AT-DP walker and ordered his AT-ATs to destroy the rebel walker. During the firefight, Kanan vouched for Kallus when Ezra expressed his suspicion that their new ally had set them up. When one of the AT-ATs proceeded to crush their AT-DP walker under its heavy body, Kanan and Ezra used their lightsabers to cut their way into the enemy walker. Once aboard, the three rebels accosted the pilots and escaped through the hatch. Their escape coincided with Morad's wife [[Marida Sumar]] firing a rocket that took out the fore leg of their hijacked walker.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nKanan and his team then escaped with Ryder on their landspeeders. Back at Ryder's base, Kanan, Ezra, and Ryder debriefed Hera, Sabine, and Zeb about their mission. After downloading the information that Chopper had stolen, the rebels discovered that Thrawn was developing a [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|new Imperial starfighter]]. Kanan and Hera expressed their fears that this new weapon would lead to the loss of pilots and threaten the rebellion. Kanan and Ezra also informed their comrades about the assistance they received from Kallus. Hera advised them to exercise caution in their interactions with Kallus.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n====The spectre of Maul====\n[[File:Ezra_tormented_by_Maul.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan stopping Ezra from killing a member of Phoenix Squadron while blinded by Maul's illusions.]]\nUsing the information that Kanan and his team had obtained, Hera planned a strike on the Lothal Imperial factory. Kanan, the other Spectres, Rex, and members of Phoenix Squadron attended the briefing. Hera decided to deploy only a fraction of Phoenix Squadron and assigned Ezra a recon mission to gather intelligence on Imperial military positions. Kanan sensed Ezra's unease when his apprentice experienced a vision of Maul among them. Kanan and Zeb tended to Ezra when he fainted after seeing an apparition of Maul behind him. When Hera asked Kanan what was wrong, he admitted he did not know.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\">{{Rebels|Visions and Voices}}</ref>\n\nLater, Kanan and the other rebels tended to Ezra when he awoke in his cabin aboard the ''Ghost''. When Ezra claimed that he was fine and insisted on continuing with the mission, Kanan thought that the problem was not over yet and that Ezra was affected by his last encounter with Maul and the holocrons. Kanan's concerns were validated after Ezra almost killed a rebel trooper he had mistaken for Maul. Kanan managed to use the Force to restrain his apprentice and told Ezra not to be blinded by the vision. After Ezra came to his senses, he was relieved of his duties.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nWhile Hera wanted to stay behind, Kanan convinced her to proceed with the mission and told her that he had a plan to tackle Ezra's problems. Kanan placed a tracking device on Ezra's [[wrist comm]] and got Sabine to track his movements. He and Ezra then ventured into the wilderness to commune with Bendu. After Ezra related his predicament, the Bendu surmised that the incomplete holocron vision was the source of the problem. When Ezra asked what to do, Bendu told him and Kanan not to turn around. Despite his warnings, the two turned and found Maul standing on top of a dune watching them.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nKanan asked Bendu what to do next only to discover he had vanished. When Kanan and Ezra brandished their lightsabers, Maul then announced that he had come to talk. He told that he had come to seek fragments of the incomplete holocron vision that resided in Ezra's mind. When Maul offered to keep Chopper Base a secret, Kanan refused to deal with him and threatened to strike him down. However, Maul revealed that he had planted a [[homing beacon]] nearby and threatened to ignite it if he was slain. With little choice, Kanan reluctantly allowed Ezra to follow Maul on his ship [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|''Nightbrother'']] to [[Dathomir]].<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nUsing the tracking device, Kanan and Sabine followed Maul and Ezra on the ''Phantom II'' to Dathomir. They landed at the [[Nightsister lair]] and ventured inside a cave. There, Kanan and Sabine discovered that Maul and Ezra had completed a ritual which involved summoning the spirits of fallen [[Nightsisters]]. Seeking their payment in flesh and blood, the spirits possessed Kanan and Sabine. The possessed Kanan and Sabine then attacked Maul and Ezra with the former engaging the darksider in a brief lightsaber duel. Since the spirits were unable to leave the cave due to the altar being their source of power, Ezra and Maul were able to escape outside.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nUnwilling to abandon his master and friend, Ezra returned alone into the cave. After exercising Sabine, he found the possessed Kanan kneeling on top of the altar, which was bathed in a green light and covered with spirits. Ezra offered his own flesh and blood as payment if the spirit left Kanan. The spirit agreed provided he bested Kanan in combat. Following a brief fight, Ezra managed to beat Kanan and the Nightsister spirit left his body. Ezra then told Kanan to leave while he parlayed with the spirits. Using his lightsaber and an ancient Mandalorian weapon called the [[Darksaber]], Ezra destroyed the altar and vanished the spirits.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nWhen Kanan returned, he asked Ezra whether their [[Skirmish on Dathomir|adventure]] was worth it and vowed never to work with Maul again. After Sabine returned to the cave, Ezra informed them that the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi held the key to destroying the Sith and that he resided on a [[Tatooine|planet]] with [[Tatoo I|twin]] [[Tatoo II|suns]]. The three resolved to get to Kenobi before Maul did and to learn the key to destroying the Sith.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\n====Mission on Geonosis====\nAt the request of Senator Bail Organa, the Spectres and Rex undertook a mission to find [[Saw Gerrera]], who was investigating the apparent disappearance of the [[Geonosian]] species. After accepting the mission, Kanan asked Rex if they should be worried about what Saw found. Rex replied that they should instead be worried about what he did not find. The rebels landed their ship ''Ghost'' near a Geonosian structure where Saw had lost contact with [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]]. Kanan accompanied Rex, Ezra, and Chopper on the search for Saw which took them into an underground labyrinth.<ref name=\"Ghosts\">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>\n\nAfter discovering discarded helmets and sealed-up tunnels, Kanan sensed danger and advocated returning to the ''Ghost''. However, Ezra and Rex insisted on pressing on with the mission due to the latter's friendship with Saw. The rebels eventually reached a dead-end and found themselves under attack from several battle droids and a droideka. Saw came to their aid and destroyed the battle droids. This allowed Kanan and his apprentice to destroy the droideka with their lightsabers.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, Saw recounted how his team had been attacked and killed by a Geonosian, who was operating battle droids. Believing that the Geonosian held the key to discovering what the Empire was building on Geonosis, Saw convinced Kanan and his team to help them capture the Geonosian. After reaching a large air shaft, Kanan contacted Hera with his comlink to warn her about the presence of operational battle droids.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nShortly, Kanan and his team discovered a lone Geonosian on the other side of the air shaft. Using the Force, Kanan helped propel his apprentice Ezra onto the other side so that he could pursue the fugitive. After Chopper joined Ezra, Kanan used the Force to suspend a stone bridge and used it help Saw and Rex cross to the other side, before joining them by [[Force jump|jumping]] across the shaft. Following a protracted pursuit, Kanan and his fellow rebels managed to capture the Geonosian, whom Ezra later nicknamed [[Klik-Klak]].<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nKanan was concerned with Saw's harsh interrogation methods and told him to let Ezra question Klik-Klak. The rebels subsequently discovered [[Klik-Klak's nest]] and found a working [[transmitter]], which Kanan used to contact Hera and arrange for a pick-up in the air shaft. Following an argument between Ezra and Saw, Kanan brokered a compromise which allowed Saw to take Klik-Klak to Chopper Base for interrogation on the condition that he was safely returned to Geonosis. Saw accepted Kanan's terms.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nKanan and his team reunited with the ''Ghost'' just as Captain [[Brunson]]'s [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] entered Geonosis. Once aboard, Hera took Kanan aside to warn him about Saw's harsh methods. Kanan and Hera were forced to intervene when Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and attempted to forcibly take Klik-Klak aboard the ''Phantom II''. When Kanan reiterated that they would question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base, Saw accused the Jedi of being soft. Following a scuffle with Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to shoot Klik-Klak's egg in an attempt to force the rebels to accede to his demands.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nThe Spectres and Saw put aside their differences to repel a boarding party of [[Jumptrooper]]s, which Brunson had dispatched. Following a brief skirmish, the ''Ghost'' descended into the depths of Geonosis. Reaching the bottom, the rebels discovered Imperial poison canisters which proved that the Empire had perpetrated [[Sterilization of Geonosis|genocide]] against the Geonosians. As a result, Saw experienced a change of heart and freed Klik-Klak and the Geonosian queen egg. The rebels then managed to escape Brunson's light cruiser by blasting it with [[rocket bomb]]s.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nAfter escaping into space, Kanan, Hera, Ezra, and Saw briefed Senator Organa and Commander Sato about the events on Geonosis. Organa believed that news of the Geonosian genocide would sway more worlds to the rebellion. Commander Sato also congratulated the rebels for rescuing Saw and obtaining a new [[deflector core]]. When Saw expressed dissatisfaction that they had not yet uncovered what the Empire was building on Geonosis, Kanan reassured him that they would eventually find out. After Saw had left, Kanan counselled Ezra that not all their allies shared their values. Hera then added that they should be content that Saw was not the Empire.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\n====Training exercise====\nKanan along with Hera, Ezra, Sabine, Wedge Antilles, Hobbie, and most of the Phoenix rebels took part in a training exercise. Prior to departure, he tried to reassure a despondent Zeb that they would be back. Zeb was despondent that he had been assigned as [[Chief of Security]] for Chopper Base. In Kanan's absence, Zeb along with Chopper and the inventory droid AP-5 neutralized the [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]] [[EXD-9]] and turned him into an improvised bomb which destroyed a Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"Warhead\">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>\n\nAfter Zeb reported an incident, Kanan and the other Spectres returned to investigate. When Chopper remarked that he had nothing to do with what happened, Kanan asked the droid to clarify his statement. Later, Kanan and the other rebels listened to a recorded message from Fulrum thanking the rebels for neutralizing the threat of the infiltrator droid. Before AP-5 could recount the full story, Zeb playfully muzzled him to the bemusement of Kanan and the other Spectres.<ref name=\"Warhead\" />\n\n====Sabine's trials====\n{{Quote|You've come a long way in a very short time. Where you go from here is up to you. But know this family will stand by you no matter what you choose.|Kanan Jarrus, to Sabine Wren|Trials of the Darksaber}}\n[[File:Trials_of_the_Darksaber.jpg|thumb|right|220x220px|Kanan training Sabine to wield the Darksaber.]]\nFollowing the events on Dathomir, Sabine Wren left the Darksaber in the care of Kanan. Realizing the weapon's history and significance, Kanan requested a meeting with Fenn Rau, the former leader of the Protectors who had since joined the rebellion. Rau recognized the weapon and related its history to Kanan. Fenn believed that Sabine could use the Darksaber to unify the Mandalorian people and to bring them over to the rebellion. Kanan told Fenn that Sabine did not want to go down that path. However, the two decided that they had to convince Sabine to change her mind for the sake of the rebellion.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nLater, Kanan helped Hera and Rau officiate a meeting with Sabine and the other Spectres. During the meeting, Kanan told Sabine that he believed that it was no coincidence that she came across the Darksaber. While Kanan acknowledged that Sabine was no Jedi, he believed that she could learn how to become proficient with the weapon. Sabine was reluctant to wield the Darksaber since the wielder also assumed leadership of the Mandalorians. Sabine believed that she was an unsuitable leader due to her estranged relationship with her family.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nWhile Kanan believed that she could change, Sabine refused to accept the challenge until Hera explained that the rebels needed the Mandalorians to help attack Lothal. After some consideration, Sabine reluctantly agreed to train with the Darksaber under the tutelage of Kanan and Ezra. When Sabine lashed out and threatened Ezra after he told her \"don't try, just learn,\" Kanan cautioned her to restrain herself. To avoid the distractions of Chopper Base, Kanan and Ezra took Sabine into the wilderness to train.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nAfter setting up camp, Kanan parried with Sabine using [[Lightsaber training staff|training sabers]] that he and Zeb has fashioned out of sticks. He thought that the Darksaber was still too dangerous for Sabine and wanted to test her fighting skills. Despite being blind, Kanan managed to use his Force powers to knock Sabine to the ground. Unimpressed with her combat skills, Kanan instructed Sabine to learn lightsaber strokes under Ezra's tutelage using sticks. After two days, Kanan chatted with Hera via hologram, who disagreed with Kanan's decision to hold back Sabine's training. Kanan rationalized that Sabine had not opened her mind to the Force. However, he agreed to accept provisions from the camp.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nLater, Fenn Rau arrived with the supplies and outfitted Sabine with [[Mandalorian vambrace]]s. Using the vambraces, Sabine managed to gain the upper hand over Ezra. Annoyed by her use of the vambraces, Kanan asked her if it was a game to her. In response, Sabine claimed she was outsmarting her opponent and challenged Kanan to \"take a shot\" and attacked him with her grappling line. Though temporarily immobilized, Kanan quickly broke free with his lightsaber and retorted that the Jedi had won the war with [[Mandalore]] and took the opportunity to lecture that while those \"tricks\" would amount to something and maybe save her from time to time, only training and discipline would keep her alive in the long run. Frustrated with Kanan's training methods, Sabine stormed off to regain her composure.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nThat evening, Kanan chatted with Hera. Hera criticized Kanan's decision to hold back Sabine's training. In order to motivate her, Hera convinced Kanan to let her wield the Darksaber so that she could claim ownership the weapon. Hera also explained that Sabine was troubled by her rejection by her own family. After Sabine returned, Kanan apologized for holding back her training. Sabine in return apologized for her sullen attitude. Kanan and Sabine then parried with their blades.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nKanan took the opportunity to drill Sabine with lightsaber strokes. As they parried, Sabine was able to strengthen her connection to the Darksaber. As part of the training session, Kanan goaded Sabine about her past decisions to abandon the Empire and leave her family. As they sparred, Sabine revealed that she had spoken out against the Empire for using her to build weapons used to enslave Mandalore. Her family had cast her out and chosen the Empire over her. Overcome with emotion, Sabine managed to gain the upper hand over Kanan but quickly terminated the duel and broke down weeping.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nPleased with Sabine's progress, Kanan comforted Sabine by telling her that the Empire ruled through fear and that her family were in a prison of their own making. He reassured Sabine that she could free her family and vowed to help her. Fenn and Ezra then joined in pledging to help Sabine to win over both her family and her people to the rebel cause.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\n====Mission to Krownest====\nAfter training Sabine, Kanan along with Ezra, Chopper, and Fenn Rau traveled on the ''Phantom II'' to the planet [[Krownest]], the seat of Clan Wren. Upon arriving, their ship was attacked by a group of Mandalorian warriors led by Sabine's brother [[Tristan Wren]]. After landing the ship in the snow, Kanan advised Fenn and Chopper to stay aboard the ship while he and the other Spectres dealt with Sabine's family. Despite a brief skirmish, Sabine managed to reunite with Tristan, who agreed to let his sister and her rebel comrades enter the [[Wren Stronghold]].<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\">{{Rebels|Legacy of Mandalore}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a cold reception, Sabine's mother Countess [[Ursa Wren]] allowed the Jedi and Sabine to enter her ancestral home provided they surrendered their weapons including the Darksaber. Kanan agreed to surrender his lightsaber if it helped them win the war. Once inside, Kanan and Ezra listened as Sabine and her mother Ursa engaged in a tense discussion about the Empire, the Protectors, and Viceroy Gar Saxon. While Sabine and Ursa left to talk privately, Kanan told Ezra to be careful with his Mandalorian hosts. He then told Tristan that he wanted to speak with the Countess.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nUrsa agreed to grant an audience to Kanan and Ezra. Unbeknownst to them, she had made a secret deal with Gar Saxon to trade the Jedi and the Darksaber in return for showing clemency to her daughter Sabine. During the meeting, Ursa chastised the Jedi for not \"knowing\" her daughter. Kanan responded that Ursa was underestimating the woman her daughter had become. When Ezra vouched for Sabine, Ursa apologized that she had \"to do something unfortunate.\" Shortly thereafter, Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos arrived and took Ezra and Kanan into custody along with the Darksaber.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nSaxon broke his earlier deal with Ursa and ordered his Super Commandos to destroy Clan Wren. At that point, Fenn Rau entered the throne room and handed Kanan and Ezra back their lightsabers. The Jedi then helped the Wrens and Fenn Rau defeat Saxon's Super Commando contingent. Kanan and the others then watched as Sabine fought Saxon in a single duel. Following a fierce skirmish, Sabine defeated Saxon and reclaimed the Darksaber. She chose to spare Saxon but the Viceroy refused to accept defeat and tried to kill her. Ursa then intervened and killed Saxon, overthrowing the [[Emperor's Hand]] on Mandalore.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nFollowing the skirmish, Sabine decided to stay behind with her family to help them reunify the Mandalorian people. Fenn Rau also elected to stay behind. Kanan and Ezra then departed with Chopper on the repaired ''Phantom II''. Before parting company with Sabine, Kanan told her that he would miss her and the two embraced. Sabine also thanked Ezra and Kanan for helping her to become a stronger person and to repair her relationship with her family.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\n====Rescuing Kallus====\nAfter the rebels discovered that Grand Admiral Thrawn was monitoring Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions, Kanan and Rex took part in a mission to rescue the rogue ISB agent and rebel informant. While Ezra, Chopper, and AP-5 stole a shuttle and allowed themselves to be captured by an Imperial light cruiser where Kallus was stationed, Kanan and Rex flew the ''Sentinel''-class landing craft [[TY997]] to rendezvous with the cruiser. The rebels had obtained a set of clearance codes which would allow them to land on the Imperial light cruiser, which was commanded by Lieutenant Lyste. For the mission, Kanan and Rex wore stormtrooper armor.<ref name=\"TIE\">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref>\n\nHowever, an unexpected change of plans occurred when Grand Admiral Thrawn ordered Agent Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste to come aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera]]'' for a meeting. Eager to trumpet his success, Lyste brought Ezra aboard. After boarding the ''Chimaera'', Chopper and AP-5 managed to update Kanan and Rex. Kanan then tasked Chopper with obtaining a new set of clearance codes that would allow them to land on Thrawn's Star Destroyer. With the help of Kallus and Ezra, Chopper succeeded in transmitting the codes to Kanan.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nAfter exiting hyperspace above the planet Lothal, Kanan and Rex discovered Thrawn's [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] in orbit. When Kanan asked how many ships, Rex told him not to worry and to transmit the clearance codes. The Imperials accepted their code and Kanan and Rex were able to dock in the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} hangar. However, Thrawn had learned that rebel infiltrators were aboard TY997 and sent Governor Pryce to arrest them. Despite their stormtrooper armor, Pryce knew that Kanan and Rex were infiltrators and ordered them to surrender.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nWhen Kanan protested, Pryce stunned him. A fight broke out between Rex, Pryce, and the Governor's stormtroopers. Pryce eventually gained the upper hand over the disguised Rex and turned to face Kanan. However, Lieutenant Lyste, mistaking her for the rebel agent Fulcrum, stunned her. Kallus then tackled Lyste to the ground while Ezra, AP-5, and Chopper fled aboard the shuttle with Kanan and Rex. Kallus then elected to stay behind in order to continue helping the rebellion and framed Lyste as Fulcrum.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\n====Supply run====\nWhile the other Spectres undertook a [[Operation Handoff|dangerous mission]] to deliver the former Imperial Senator [[Mon Mothma]] through the [[Archeon pass]], Kanan volunteered for a supply run.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref>\n\n===Alliance to Restore the Republic===\n====Maul's last stand====\nAfter Ezra Bridger received messages through Kanan's Jedi holocron and the Malachor Sith holocron indicating that Obi-Wan Kenobi was in danger from Maul, Kanan found a troubled Ezra in his quarters where the holocrons were kept. Kanan, the other Spectres, Rex, and Commander Sato met at Chopper Base's command center to discuss the situation. Kanan was unsure what the holocrons were trying to say while Rex thought that Kenobi had died. Since the Phoenix Squadron was planning to attack Lothal, Hera urged Ezra to focus on the mission ahead and to set aside his anxieties about Master Kenobi.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nDespite Hera's advice, Ezra and Chopper stole an [[RZ-1T trainer]] and traveled to Tatooine. After enduring an attack by [[Tusken Raider]]s and the scorching heat, the two rebels encountered Master Kenobi, who revealed that Maul had used the holocrons to lure Ezra to Tatooine. While Ezra and Chopper returned to Atollon on Maul's ship ''Nightbrother'', Kenobi dealt with Maul and slew the darksider. Kanan, Hera, and Zeb met Ezra and Chopper when they returned to Chopper Base. Ezra apologized for leaving and stressed that his fellow Spectres were his family.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\n====Battle of Atollon====\nAs the rebels mustered for their attack on Lothal, Kanan complimented his apprentice Ezra for his contributions to the rebellion. While Kanan expressed doubts that he was a good teacher, Ezra reassured his master that he had taught him about life. Kanan along with Ezra and Hera then attended a hologram briefing with Commander Sato and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]], who had arrived in the [[Atollon system]] with his [[Massassi Group]]. General Dodonna had come to aid the Phoenix Squadron in their attack on the Imperial TIE Defender factories on Lothal.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\nLater, Kanan and Ezra were present at the command center when the rebel readers received an urgent transmission from Fulcrum warning that Thrawn was aware of the attack. Soon Thrawn's Seventh Fleet entered and blockaded the Atollon system. Kanan was present when Hera outlined her battle plan to launch an attack on the Imperial fleet in order to provide an opening for the rebels to send a ship seeking reinforcements offworld. Hera assigned Kanan and Ezra for the mission, reasoning that the Jedi had a better chance of success. She allocated Maul's former starship ''Nightbrother'' for the mission.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nHowever, Kanan insisted that he had to go into the wilderness and warn a friend about the attack. Despite her reservations, Hera reluctantly allowed Kanan to proceed when he convinced her to trust him. In Kanan's absence, Hera instead assigned Ezra and Chopper the mission. Kanan traveled on his Joben T-85 speeder bike into the krykna nest where Bendu dwelled. The Bendu was furious with Kanan for bringing war to his planet. Kanan tried to plead for Bendu to aid the rebels but Bendu insisted on remaining neutral.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nWhile the battle raged in space, Kanan told Bendu that he could not remain in the middle while innocents died. However, Bendu was ambivalent to the Rebellion. When Bendu argued that all things were predestined to die, Kanan contended that they were not meant to be crushed by \"overwhelming evil.\" Frustrated with Bendu's stubbornness, Kanan accused him of cowardice. This angered Bendu, and the creature responded that perhaps it was the will of the Force for the Jedi to be destroyed before vanishing into thin air.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nKanan rode his speeder bike back to Chopper Base. He contacted Hera via comlink and was told to hurry up. On the way, Thrawn launched his [[orbital bombardment]]. Kanan's bike was destroyed but the Jedi narrowly survived and managed to reunite with Rex and Zeb. As Thrawn's AT-AT walkers and stormtroopers entered the base, Kanan used his lightsaber to topple one of the walkers. After playing cat and mouse with Thrawn's [[death trooper]]s, Kanan reunited with Hera and the remaining rebels. They attempted to flee aboard the ''Ghost'' but were surrounded by Thrawn's troops.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nThe Grand Admiral demanded that Hera surrender and threatened to kill her companions, beginning with the Jedi. In response, Kanan flashed his lightsaber. Meanwhile, storm clouds began forming above Chopper Base. When Thrawn remarked about the fear on Kanan's face, the Jedi responded that the Grand Admiral should be afraid of the storm coming. The Bendu then manifested into a lightning storm and narrowly struck Thrawn. Kanan then warned the other rebels to hold on to something. As Bendu launched his attack on Chopper Base, Kanan and his rebel comrades fled aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nThey and the surviving rebel ships then headed into space as Bendu ordered both the rebels and Imperials to leave his planet. Upon reaching space, Kanan and his comrades discovered that Ezra and Sabine had returned with Mandalorian reinforcements, who had destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser. After picking up Agent Kallus, the rebel convoy fled into hyperspace. The rebel convoy then traveled to [[Yavin 4]]. During the journey, Kanan met Kallus, who thanked the rebels for taking him in. Kanan responded by thanking Kallus for risking everything for them. Kanan then comforted Ezra about the recent defeat and reassured his apprentice that they were alive and would continue fighting for a future where everyone was free.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n====Mandalore====\nKanan, along with Ezra and Chopper, traveled to Mandalore to help Sabine and Clan Wren in [[Mission to Mandalore|rescuing]] her father [[Alrich Wren]] from a Imperial prison. Kanan fought alongside Rau against several jumptroopers. Kanan and Rau were joined by the [[Nite Owls]] of [[Clan Kryze]] under [[Lord|Lady]] [[Bo-Katan Kryze]]. Following the attack, Kanan spoke with Hera, who told them they could stay on Mandalore for long. Kanan was told to return after they freed Sabine's father. Despite being a valuable asset the Alliance, Kanan did not like being seen as an \"asset.\" Hera told Kanan to stay safe regardless.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]''</ref>\n\nKanan, along with Kyze and Rau, later attacked the convoy that had Sabine's father. With Sabine, Kanan fought off several [[scout trooper]]s and took the stormtrooper on one of the ITTs. Despite rescuing Sabine's father, the Mandalorians came under attack by the \"[[Arc Pulse Generator|Duchess]],\" a weapon Sabine had designed. Kanan helped Sabine rescue her mother and brother before the Empire returned. They were able to escape on Kryze's [[Kom'rk-class fighter/transport|gauntlet fighter]]. At [[Kryze command camp|Kryze's camp]], Kyze and Sabine came up with plan to destroy the Duchess; Kanan volunteered himself, Ezra, and Chopper to erase the Duchess's data from the Imperial database.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nAs the Mandalorians fought the stormtroopers aboard Governor [[Tiber Saxon]] [[Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]], Kanan, Ezra and Chopper searched for the databases. They fought several stormtroopers as Chopper erased the Duchess's information from the database. Kanan then let Ezra help Sabine in destroying the Duchess. Kanan and the Mandalorians then left the Destroyer as it was destroyed.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\n====Jalindi and the Tonnis sector====\nKanan, along with Ezra and Sabine then returned to Yavin 4. Kanan then saw Hera make a crash-landing and was happy to have the Spectres back together. As Kanan meditated, Kanan then listened to Gerrera's speech about the Alliance's unwillingness to destroy [[Jalindi Station]]. Kanan also reminded Ezra that it was important choose how to fight, not just what to fight for.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>\n\nKanan and the Spectres then went to [[Jalindi]] to [[Mission to Jalindi|hijack]] the Relay. After the briefing, Kanan talked to Hera about how the Empire continued to hurt and they want to hurt it back. However, Hera told Kanan that it was Gerrera talking, not him and assured him that they would do the right thing. Kanan then had scramble the ''Ghost''{{'s}} signature. However, Zeb told him that an Imperial [[Marauder|light cruiser]] then arrived. When the light cruiser deployed several TIE/D Defenders, Kanan helped Hera pilot the ''Ghost'' through a fog bank. However, the Relay was destroyed, and Gerrera took Ezra and Sabine. Following Gerrera's [[Mission to Faos Station|destruction]] of a Kyber crystal, Kanan was unsettled as to the reason the Empire needed them. After Sabine asked if these crystals could be weaponized, Kanan was unsure.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal====\nWhen Ezra started to have visions about old Jho and Azadi, Kanan told him he was having these visions because of his anxiety of Lothal's situation. Following their landing at Yavin 4's [[Great Temple]], they were summoned by Mothma to a briefing. There, they were shown a message from Azadi about a [[TIE/D Defender Elite|new type of TIE/D Defender]] being tested on Lothal. After Ezra volunteered to return to Lothal, Kanan and the other Spectres decided to go with him.<ref name=\"Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>\n\nKanan and the others then put on civilian disguises after they boarded Vizago's ship the ''[[Broken Horn]]''. After making their landing and escape at [[Jhothal]], Kanan was sure that Vizago would be able to weasel his way out of his predicament with the Empire. Kanan and Zeb then searched for transportation. During this time, Kanan and Hera moved through the streets and likely used this time alone to become intimate enough to conceive [[Jacen Syndulla|their future child]].<ref name=\"Occupation\" />\n\nSometime during this nomadic and hand-to-mouth period, Kanan told Hera that it has been a long time since they've been alone like this and wished he could see her. As she said that he could always see her, they moved to make love, only to be interrupted by a message from Zeb, who had found some speeders they could use. Realizing that they had to move again, Kanan was left extremely disappointed. Following an explosion, they managed to find and pick up Ezra and Sabine. However, they were then confronted by several [[TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tank|assault tanks]].<ref name=\"Occupation\" />\n\nAfter their speeder was destroyed, they were then led by Jai Kell back to Old Jho's Pit Stop where there was an entrance to the sewers. Kanan then sensed that the stormtroopers and their death trooper commander, [[DT-L21]] had deployed several Imperial probes. Kanan and the others then split up. When Chopper found a [[Starbird (symbol)|Starbird]] symbol, Kanan destroyed one of the probe droids and continue through the sewers with Kell and Hera. As they joined up with other Spectres, they found a way out by climbing a ladder. Kanan then severed the ladder as they made their escape. As they left the sewer, they were then picked up by Azadi and Marida Sumar in their [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]].<ref name=\"Occupation\" />\n\n====The TIE/D Defender Elite heist====\nWhile Ezra, Sabine, Zeb, and Ryder Azadi traveled to the [[Lothal Imperial airfield|Imperial testing facility]] where the TIE/D Defender Elite was being tested, Kanan remained at Ezra's old tower with Hera and Chopper. When Hera reported that the Empire was fortifying its anti-aircraft air defenses and installing new fuel tanks at the Imperial factories, Kanan remarked that the Empire was going to start full-scale production of the new fighter on Lothal. After Ezra and Sabine stole the TIE/D Defender Elite, Kanan met Ryder and Zeb when they returned to Ryder's U-wing. When Zeb grumbled about the kids' \"stunt,\" Kanan told him not to worry. He accompanied Hera on a rescue flight, and the two managed to find Ezra and Sabine, who brought the fighter's [[flight data recorder]]. When Ezra related his encounter with a mythical [[loth-wolf]] to Kanan, he responded that \"all paths were coming together\" but they would know what it meant when they finally got there.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Kanan and his rebel comrades waited at the [[Lothal resistance camp]] while Ezra, Zeb, and Kell returned to the crash site to retrieve the hyperdrive. While meditating, he and Hera talked about the Spectres' special connection to Lothal. Kanan also agreed with Hera's observation that they were predestined to meet Ezra.<ref name=\"DragonCon2018\">{{Cite_web|url=https://thewookieegunner.com/2018/09/08/star-wars-animation-panels-highlights-dragon-con/#more-17162|title=Highlights of the 'Star Wars' Animation Panels at Dragon Con 2018|author=Macias, Johnamarie|date=2018-09-08|publisher=thewookieegunner.com|quote=Bria LaVorgna brought up the question of when Jacen Syndulla was conceived. Gilroy described a scene from the episode \u201cKindred,\u201d where Hera finds Kanan meditating out in the fields. He said there was a time-cut or dissolve after that and \u201ca lot of things can happen in a dissolve.\u201d|archivedate=20200214162955}}</ref>\n\nWhile waiting for the hyperdrive to be installed, Kanan asked Hera about her commitment to the Rebellion and the two talked about their future plans following the Empire's defeat. They were alerted by Ryder Azadi to the arrival of an Imperial Troop Transport. Despite preparing for an assault, the rebels were mollified when Zeb exited the transport with the recovered hyperdrive. While Sabine installed the hyperdrive onto Ryder's U-wing, Kanan told her that he was worried about her. Hera responded that she had to do her job and the two kissed passionately. After Hera and Chopper departed with the flight data recorder, Kanan and the other rebels fled into a network of caves. There, they were guided by a pack of loth-wolves into a mountain ledge in Lothal's southern hemisphere. Kanan also interacted with one of the wolves, which called him by his birth-name \"Dume.\" As a result, Kanan realized that the loth-wolves had a special connection to the Force and speculated that the Empire was doing something \"terrible to Lothal.\" He and Ezra pondered on where the Force was leading them to.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\n====Boarding the ore crawler====\nAfter the rebels had set up [[Lothal cliff dwelling|camp]] inside the caves, Kanan and his fellow rebels encountered a Mining Guild [[ore crawler]], [[Crawler 413-24]], as it was harvesting minerals from Lothal's surface. At the urging of Zeb, the Spectres decided to board and hijack the ship. After Sabine took out the sentry droids, Ryder delivered Kanan and his team aboard a speeder before driving away. Heading to the bridge, the rebels encountered the [[Trandoshan]] Mining Guild captain [[Seevor]]. Zeb managed to subdue Seevor but the rebels failed to stop him from sending a distress call to the Mining Guild. While Sabine was repairing their transmitter, they heard a signal emanating from the engine room.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>\n\nKanan and Zeb went below deck to investigate with Kanan exploring the lower deck while Zeb checked the upper deck. In the lower deck, Kanan encountered several indentured prisoners including the crime lord Vizago, who had smuggled them into Lothal. Kanan was then attacked by the Trandoshan foreman [[Proach]], who was armed with an [[electro-whip]]. Kanan fought back with his lightsaber but the Trandoshan wrapped his whip around his arm, causing Kanan to drop his weapon. Zeb then fought Proach on the catwalk outside. The two fell off the guard-raid but Zeb managed to hold on long enough to call Kanan for help. By the time Kanan had arrived, Proach had fallen to his death. Kanan helped Zeb up and the two rejoined their companions.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\nWhen the Empire dispatched a search party, Kanan along with Ezra and Sabine hid in the bridge's cabinet. Zeb posed as an overseer while Vizago posed as the captain. Despite convincing the Imperials that there was no trouble, the rebels encountered a new predicament when Seevor escaped through the ventilators into the engine room. Seevor shut down the reactors and goaded the Spectres. Ezra entered the engine room and killed Seevor following a confrontation. Following Seevor's death, Vizago and the other liberated prisoners joined the Rebel Alliance out of gratitude to their liberators. Kanan and the Spectres then managed to re-establish contact with Hera, who informed them that she had convinced Rebel Command to authorize a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] on the Imperial factories on Lothal. Kanan and his group agreed to serve as the ground support team.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\n====Attack on Lothal====\nAs part of the Rebel Alliance's ground support team on Lothal, Kanan and the Spectres Ezra, Sabine, and Zeb planted explosives on anti-air [[turbolaser]]s outside the Imperial Armory Complex. They finished planting their explosives just as Hera's squadron of [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]]s entered Lothal's orbit and clashed with Grand Admiral Thrawn's Seventh Fleet. The group then departed on speeder bikes to rendezvous with Ryder Azadi's team. However, Thrawn's forces wiped out much of Hera's starfighter force, with a few survivors crash-landing in Capital City, forcing Kanan and the others to retreat.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\nDuring Thrawn's brief departure from the conflict, the Grand Admiral expressed discontent towards being drawn away from the conflict with Jarrus and the other rebels.<ref name=\"Thrawn Alliances\">''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]''</ref>\n\nWhile traveling on the highway, Kanan brought his speeder bike to a stop and told the others that he had to go back to rescue Hera. While Ezra understood and said they would see him back at base, Sabine thought they should accompany Kanan to find Hera. Ezra managed to convince Sabine to let Kanan find Hera on his own. While approaching Capital City, Kanan sensed a Loth-wolf and brought his bike to a halt. The creature then suddenly vanished, causing Kanan to fall off his bike. In exasperation, Kanan told the wolf that he had no time for diversions and to stay out of his way. The wolf then reappeared with two other wolves and spoke Kanan's former name, Dume. Removing his visor, Kanan replied that he knew what he had to do. Kanan later rendezvoused with Chopper and Mart Mattin, two survivors of Hera's ill-fated strike force. After learning of Hera's capture by Imperial forces, Kanan evacuated the two rebels to safety on his speeder bike.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\n====Hera's rescue and death====\n{{Quote|Kanan, I know what to say now. I love you.''\"<br />''\"Must be the truth serum talking.''\"<br />''\"No. It's me. All me.|Hera Syndulla and Kanan Jarrus's last conversation|Jedi Night}}\nThe rebels concocted a plan for Kanan, Ezra and Sabine to [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue]] Hera from Thrawn's clutches, returning to the city at night and infiltrating the Complex by using [[Loth-bat glider]]s that they had built themselves. During the rescue mission, Kanan retrieved Hera's Kalikori from Thrawn's office. Then, he climbed to the top of the tower in which Hera was being kept prisoner and tortured by Governor Pryce for information on the whereabouts of the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]]. Kanan took out the two stormtroopers guarding Hera, and after she remarked that she disliked his new haircut, they climbed to the roof, where they escaped using the gliders they'd fashioned. Stormtroopers flew after them, but Ezra and Sabine came to their rescue and shot down the Imperial pilots. Kanan and Hera landed on top of an Imperial fuel tower, waiting for the other Rebels to pick them up. It was there that Hera finally admitted that she loved him, and they kissed.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\n[[File:Kanan's_final_moments.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan sacrifices himself.]]\nSeeing the Rebels about to escape, Pryce ordered the pilot of the walker they were in to fire upon the fuel tower, causing it to explode. Kanan ran towards the amassing inferno and used the Force to keep the flames from engulfing them. Hera ran towards Kanan but he stopped her with the Force and Force pushed Hera onto the ship, before sending the ship out of the the blast radius. Seconds before letting the blast consume him, his eyes were restored, granting him his wish to see Hera again. Then, Jarrus, consumed by the flames, [[Death|passed away]] and became one with the Force.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n====Savior of the Ghost crew====\n[[File:Spectres_painting.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sabine's mural of Kanan and the other Spectres, flanked by loth-wolves.]]\nHis death allowed the team to escape with their lives,<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" /> and the destruction of the fuel supply momentarily halted the production of Thrawn's TIE Defender project, which the Rebels would later exploit. As Hera grieved for Kanan, Chopper convinced her that Kanan's selfless sacrifice in rescuing her alongside her entire family history on the Kalikori made him worthy of joining her family. Hera thought that was a good idea, and, in Kanan's honor, she added a piece of his Jedi Holocron on the Kalikori, representing him as an official honorary member of the Syndulla family, forever.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\nAlthough his death greatly affected his teammates, it had significant repercussions. In honor of Kanan, his partner Hera vowed to help Ezra stop the Empire from threatening the Lothal Jedi Temple. The Emperor had foreseen that the death of Kanan had created an alteration in the Force that \"altered the fate of Lothal.\" While surveying the [[Excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple|excavation site]] of the Jedi Temple, Hera felt Kanan's ghostly presence comforting her.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref>\n\nShortly after rescuing Tano from the clutches of Vader in the [[World Between Worlds]], Tano explained to Ezra that Kanan, who was now part of the [[Cosmic Force]], was still able to communicate to the living through the Force. Ezra later attempted to use the World Between Worlds to travel to the past and save Kanan from his death, but Tano convinced him to not do so as Kanan placed himself where he was most needed.<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>\n\n====Liberation of Lothal and posthumous fatherhood====\n{{Quote|By that time, there had been a new member added to the crew of the ''Ghost''&mdash;Spectre-7, Jacen Syndulla. Born to fly, just like his mother. And, well, we all know what his father was like.|Sabine Wren|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}\nIn the end through both this experience and the message given by the Loth-wolf [[Dume (Loth-wolf)|Dume]] who was believed to carry on Kanan's will after death, Ezra was able to learn a valuable final lesson from his master which he passed onto the rest of the Spectres, to be able to let go as Kanan had fulfilled his role.<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\" />\n\nThis lesson was significant, as Ezra was capable of resisting the Emperor's seduction at being reunited with his deceased parents through the gateway the Emperor so desired to control. Instead of giving in to his manipulation, Ezra found the fortitude needed to let go of his parents and thwart the Emperor's plans by destroying the remnants of the Jedi temple. Subsequently following Kanan's example to be where he was most needed, Ezra sacrificed himself in order to take Thrawn with himself away from Lothal, enabling the rebels to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate Lothal]] from the Empire.<ref name=\"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\nSometime after the liberation, Hera [[Reproduction|gave birth]] to the child, a boy, that she had conceived with Kanan before his death, naming him [[Jacen Syndulla|Jacen]]. He largely inherited Kanan's looks in spite of being a [[hybrid]] between a human and Hera's species. Additionally, to honor Kanan's memory, Sabine painted a mural of him and the other Spectres flanked by loth-wolves and loth-cats to show that they operated like a family.<ref name=\"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\" />\n\n====The Final Order====\n{{Quote|In the heart of a Jedi lies her strength.|Kanan speaking to Rey|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\nDuring the [[battle of Exegol]] in [[35 ABY]], Kanan Jarrus' voice was one among those of many Jedi of the past who aided [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] with killing the resurrected Darth Sidious, with Jarrus saying that she was not alone and that a Jedi's strength was in their heart. The voice of Luke Skywalker, who was Rey's master when alive, followed that of Kanan, telling her that the Force would always be with her, similar to what Kanan said to an unconscious Ezra, his own apprentice, after his journey in the World Between Worlds.<ref name=\"Episode IX\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I lost my way for a long time, but now I have a chance to change things.|Kanan Jarrus|Path of the Jedi}}\n[[File:Star_Wars_Kanan_12_textless_cover.png|thumb|left|300x330px|Once the Padawan Caleb Dume, the man who became Kanan Jarrus found a new life.]]\nDuring his youth, Kanan Jarrus (or rather, Caleb Dume) had a tendency to ask many questions, hoping to better understand things, which earned him somewhat of a bad reputation among his peers,<ref name=\"AND\" /> but it was that inquisitive nature that motivated Billaba to choose him as her apprentice.

She persuaded him to join her to fight for a lost way of life\u2014to work as a rebel leader, for which he resumed his lost qualities of bravery, honor, and perseverance.<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> The two later developed a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"ComingSoon SWR S2\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/620441-star-wars-rebels-cast-and-crew-talk-season-2-and-clone-wars-connections|title=Star Wars Rebels Cast and Crew Talk Season 2 and Clone Wars Connections|author=Busch, Jenna|date=2015-10-07|publisher=comingsoon.net|archivedate=20170711093531}}</ref>\n\nHaving felt adrift since the destruction of the Jedi way of life, he had developed a cynical and cocky personality,<ref name=\"AND\" /> and couldn't stand \"protocol nonsense.\"<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" /><ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" /> He was also known for humorous banter and for having \"a thousand one-liners ready to go.\"<ref name=\"Rise\">''[[Rise of the Rebels]]''</ref>\n\nNever having made it past the rank of Padawan until years into Ezra's training,<ref name=\"Kanan 2\" /> Jarrus had little confidence in his skills as a Jedi and teacher.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" /><ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\" /> He was self-conscious about his incomplete Jedi training, and thus hesitated to train Ezra Bridger.<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> Furthermore, Depa Billaba's last words haunted him and, as the Inquisitor once commented, the former Jedi was afraid of his own power, afraid to wear his lightsaber out in the open.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" /> However, during a lightsaber duel with the Sentinel, a manifestation of the Grand Inquisitor as a Jedi Temple Guard, Jarrus realized he should feel content with teaching Ezra all he could, and to his surprise, he was Knighted by the Sentinel.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" /> Jarrus's experiences during the Clone Wars left him wary of being involved with military affairs. When the ''Ghost'' crew was faced with the opportunity to join Phoenix Squadron and become full-fledged members of the Rebel fleet, Jarrus was reluctant to go along, citing his distaste for military protocol and the broader consequences of fighting a war, and became apprehensive and disdainful.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n[[File:KananJarrusWantedPoster-SWCT.png|thumb|right|220px|Kanan Jarrus Imperial wanted poster]]\nJarrus also harbored substantial animosity towards clone troopers for the role they had played in killing Billaba and hunting him down. As a result, Jarrus found it difficult to trust the retired clones Rex, Gregor and Wolffe,<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" /> and yet, despite his hard feelings towards them, Kanan decided to rescue them during an Imperial assault on Seelos.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\" /> After Rex joined the Rebellion and befriended his apprentice Ezra, Jarrus argued with the clone on a few occasions about how to train the young Jedi.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" /><ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" /> Despite his issues with clones, Jarrus was able to work with Rex to rescue Ezra and several other Phoenix rebels during a [[Rescue on the Imperial Interdictor|rescue mission]] aboard the Imperial Interdictor.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\nAs a result of attaining Jedi Knighthood during his [[Jedi Trials]] at the Lothal Jedi Temple, Kanan resolved to keep his apprentice Ezra from falling to the dark side. Kanan was willing to die for this cause.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" /> Having grown up during the last years of the Jedi Order, Kanan distrusted the former [[Sith apprentice]] Maul and realized that he wanted to use Ezra for his powers. Kanan's distrust of Maul was confirmed when the darksider blinded him on Malachor.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nKanan's blinding had a great impact on the Jedi Knight's life and worldview. Kanan withdrew from his responsibilities in Hera's rebel cell and the Phoenix Squadron to meditate in the Force. Due to his upbringing, Kanan distrusted anything associated with the Sith and dark side and chastised Ezra for toying with a [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|Sith holocron]] he had found on Malachor. Under the tutelage of the Bendu, Kanan learned to see through the Force, overcome his fears of the spider-like krykna, and repair his strained relationship with Ezra. By repairing his relationship with his rebel friends, Kanan was able to regain his connection to the Force.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n[[File:Honed_Skills_WotF.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan remained skilled with his lightsaber even after being blinded.]]\nKanan was a strict and methodical teacher. Due to Sabine's initial lack of enthusiasm for the Darksaber, Kanan believed that it would be safer for her to begin her training by sparring with melee sticks and learning the basic lightsaber strokes. As a seasoned Jedi, Kanan was knowledgeable of history and familiar with Mandalorian vambraces. His emphasis on skills and discipline clashed with Sabine's free-spirited and improvised style of combat. The two were able to resolve their differences after Sabine overcame her strained memories of her family and Kanan decided to trust Sabine's ability to bond with the Darksaber herself.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nWhile Kanan expressed doubts that he was a good teacher for his apprentice Ezra since he had not completed his own training, Ezra reassured his master that he had taught him about life and how to be a better person. Kanan tried to reason with Bendu to aid the rebellion against Thrawn's Imperial forces but underestimated the creature's stubborn devotion to neutrality and volatile temperament. Kanan later complimented his former adversary Agent Kallus for risking his life to aid the rebellion. Due to his past experiences, Kanan was also able to look past the rebels' crushing defeat at Atollon. He reassured his apprentice that they were fortunate to survive and that this meant they could continue fighting for a free galaxy.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nHe and Hera came to believe that the Spectres had a special connection to Lothal and that they were predestined to cross paths with Ezra.<ref name=\"Kindred\" /> While Kanan loved Hera and was reluctant to abandon her, he heeded the wolf's warning not to go into Capital City and instead evacuated the rebels Chopper and Mart Mattin.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\n===Relationship with Hera Syndulla===\nAfter revealing himself as a Jedi, Kanan agreed to become a member of Syndulla's crew.<ref name=\"AND\" /> Kanan would be deeply concerned when he would about Hera being in trouble.<ref name=\"Out of Darkness\" /> After Kanan was blinded by Maul, he was comforted by Hera.<ref name=\"Twilight\" /> She assured him that despite his blindness, Kanan could still see her.<ref name=\"Occupation\" /> Despite the odds against the rebels, Kanan still thought of a future with his lover Hera.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Lightsaber skills===\n{{Quote|In close-quarter fighting, Billaba's emphasis was always on Form III, which you favor to a ridiculous degree.|The Grand Inquisitor, to Kanan Jarrus|Rise of the Old Masters}}\n[[File:Kanan_FDCR.png|thumb|left|250px|Jarrus was skilled in Form III lightsaber combat.]]\nKanan Jarrus had some skill in Form III due to his training under Depa Billaba,<ref name=\"Kanan 1\" /> who was a master of the style and emphasized its use in close-quarter fighting.
