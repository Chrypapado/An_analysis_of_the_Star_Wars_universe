The apprentice of [[Jedi Master]] [[Nib Assek]], his master learned [[Shyriiwook]] so she could communicate with him.<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" />\n\nBurryaga and his master participated in the rescue effort to save the [[Hetzal system]] during the [[Great Hyperspace Disaster]]. He was the one who discovered that several of the [[hyperspace]] anomalies bearing down on the worlds of the [[Star system|system]] were [[starship]] fragments with people still alive onboard. While Jedi pilots attempted to destroy the starship fragments, Burryaga felt the survivors' terror so deeply that it radiated through the Jedi [[Avar Kriss's network|Force network]]. Facing a [[language]] barrier, the other Jedi believed that they were feeling Burryaga's own emotions and initially attempted to remove him from the network. Burryaga's efforts ultimately made the other Jedi realize that the starship fragments had survivors aboard.<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" />\n\nBurryaga wielded a [[Color|blue]] [[lightsaber]] with a physical crossguard on the hilt.<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" />\n\nBurryaga disliked social gatherings due to the fact that most people could not understand him. However, when he was onboard the [[Galactic Republic]] [[Hospital ship|medical frigate]] ''[[Panacea]]'' with the many patients from the ''[[Legacy Run]]'', he was able to help comfort the [[human]] boy [[Serj Ukkarian]].<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Burryaga_Agaburry_Concept_Art.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Concept art of Burryaga Agaburry]]\nBurryaga Agaburry was created for the ''[[Star Wars: The High Republic]]'' publishing project.
