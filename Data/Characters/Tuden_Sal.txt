When Pavan became involved in [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] officer [[Hath Monchar]]'s plot to sell details of the impending Trade Federation blockade of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] and knew he would not survive the ordeal, he entrusted his droid [[I-5YQ]] to Sal. Sal, who had long coveted the droid, quickly wiped I-Five's memory with the intent of reprogramming it. Before the reprogramming could occur, however, Sal was ruined financially in a hostile takeover backed by then-Senator [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Sal liquidated all of his remaining assets, including I-Five who was sold to a spice smuggler. Sal later met I-5YQ again, when the droid was with [[Jax Pavan]].\n\nIn [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]], following the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] establishment, Sal later joined the [[Whiplash]] as an operative and spawned an ill-fated plot to assassinate [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. He was killed after he shot [[Kalibar Droosh]] until the Imperial officer gave Sal a fatal wound as well.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Coruscant Nights III: Patterns of Force]]''\n*[[The Last Jedi (novel)|''The Last Jedi'']]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|139|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tuden Sal#legends\n|hu=Tuden Sal\n|pl=Tuden Sal\n|ru=\u0422\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0430\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sal, Tuden}}\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sakiyans]]\n[[Category:Whiplash members]]"}}}]}}}}
