The Empire won't stand for this civil war. Not when it jeopardizes what they've hidden here.|Sardoth to [[Erla]]|Rebellion 6}}\n'''Sardoth''' was a [[Gender/Legends|Male]] [[Iktotchi/Legends|Iktotchi]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Allying himself with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Sardoth aided the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]] in hunting down his fellow Jedi as the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was exterminated during the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]]. He would serve as an agent of the criminal named [[Raze (criminal)|Raze]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ahakista/Legends|Ahakista]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Iktotchi/Legends|Iktotchi]], Sardoth was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] during the final decades of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Selected as the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Lycan]], the pair traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] together; during this time Lycan introduced his Padawan to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] as he sank deeper and deeper into the depths of its power. Following his master's capture by the Jedi and his eventual death, Sardoth managed to ascend to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] before succumbing fully to the thrall of the dark side. Coming into contact with agents of the mysterious [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], Sardoth was able to avoid execution during the initial days of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] by aiding the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] hunt down and kill his fellow Jedi.<ref name=\"TAG\" />\n\nUltimately Sardoth learned that betrayal was the way of the Sith. The Empire turned on Sardoth when his usefulness was diminished and he was forced to flee to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ahakista/Legends|Ahakista]] during the early stages of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] and open [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|rebellion]] against the Empire. From Ahakista, Sardoth owned and operated the [[Daystar Casino/Legends|Daystar Casino]] and collected illegal Jedi [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] deemed contraband by the Empire. Aside from his business with the casino, Sardoth was working with the crime lord known as [[Raze (criminal)|Raze]] who ran a [[Raze's organization|black market organization]] in the criminal underground of Ahakista. In his capacity as Raze's majordomo Sardoth continued to monitor the Empire's growing presence on the planet, fearing that the construction of the [[Pyramid One]] would disrupt business and eventually lead to his own execution by an angry populace.<ref name=\"TAG\" />\n\nFollowing the historic [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Sardoth observed the escalation of the [[Ahakistan Civil War|civil war]] brewing on Ahakista. Conversing with his associate [[Erla]] when [[Council]]man [[Derral]] was assassinated, Sardoth hoped to prevent his own death during the oncoming war. He gave criminal agent [[Wyl Tarson]] his orders when the Human arrived on the planet to do a mission for Raze which involved cooperating with the local rebels. Allowing Tarson and [[Laynara]] to use the casino as a base, Sardoth and Raze were secretly planning a special surprise for Tarson when his mission was complete. When Sardoth discovered that [[Darca Nyl]] was traveling with Tarson he instantly recognized the lightsaber of his old master hanging from the man's belt. Believing Nyl to be a Jedi, Sardoth took the man into his private chambers to show off his own collection of lightsabers as a sort of silent threat.<ref name=\"TAG\" />\n\n[[File:Darca-Sardoth.jpg|thumb|left|Sardoth dueling [[Darca Nyl]].]]\n\nAt Raze's command, Sardoth had arranged for Tarson and his companions to encounter Imperial agent [[Rasha Bex]], a secret agent of Raze's also. Additionally the agents were introduced to [[Dunlan]], the leaders of the anti-Imperial rebellion brewing on the planet. When each of Raze's minions were together, Sardoth revealed to them that their mission was to destroy Pyramid One and [[The Hub (computer)|the Hub]] facility. Leading the group through the tunnels under the Imperial facilities, Sardoth trailed behind Nyl, who had broken away from the group to find his own way into the Hub. When they entered the darkness of the tunnels, Sardoth revealed his own Jedi heritage and accused Nyl of killing his old master and taking his lightsaber. Attacking Nyl, Sardoth was evenly matched by the man's skill and would have ended in a stalemate if not for the arrival of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].<ref name=\"TAG\" />\n\nLeaping at the chance to become a Sith Lord himself, Sardoth forgot about his quarrel with Nyl and put all of his efforts into winning the the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] Sith's favor. Dismissing Sardoth's pleas as that of a failure who would have already been chosen if he was worthy, Vader ended Sardoth's life with a swift strike to the neck with his lightsaber.<ref name=\"TAG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: The Ahakista Gambit]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sardoth\n}}\n\n[[Category:Ahakistans]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Iktotchi]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
