The [[Je'daii Ranger]] [[Hawk Ryo]] introduced Kora to his older brother [[Volnos Ryo]], a member of Shikaakwa's [[Clan Ryo]], one of the [[Nine Houses]] of Shikaakwa and the two fell in love and were [[Marriage/Legends|married]] not long afterwards. Volnos lived a life of study and travel, and Kora bore him a daughter named [[Tasha Ryo|Tasha]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 0\" /> However, when Volnos became [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] of Clan Ryo after his [[Volnos Ryo's father|father's]] [[Death/Legends|death]] in [[25,805 BBY]] during the [[Despot War]] between the [[Despot Queen]] [[Hadiya]] and the Je'daii, Kora dissolved their marriage according to Je'daii law and moved back to Tython with her daughter, as she was disgusted by her husband's new role as a [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 7\" /> By the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[25,793 BBY]], Kora Ryo had become the [[Je'daii Temple Master|Temple Master]] of [[Kaleth]], the [[Je'daii Temples|Temple]] of Knowledge.<ref name=\"DOTJ 0\" /> Most nights, Ryo meditated before the setting [[Star/Legends|sun]] [[Tythos]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 7\" />\n\n[[File:Kora_thinking.png|thumb|left|140px|Kora Ryo in Kaleth]]\nWhen an [[Devourer (Rakatan ship)|unknown ship]] crashed on Tython, [[Je'daii Ranger]]s [[Rori Fenn]] and [[Hawk Ryo]] were dispatched with Temple Master [[Quan-Jang]] to investigate the crash, and Master Ryo analyzed their ships's readings as the three scouted the crash site. From the data, Ryo was able to determine that the ship was far larger than any of the [[Tythan]] [[Sleeper ship/Legends|sleeper ships]], and both the crew and the ship were foreign to the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]]. Analyzing reports from the other temples, Ryo also realized that a powerful [[Force storm (weather)|Force Storm]] was growing across Tython.<ref name=\"DOTJ 3\" /> As the storm grew in strength, Temple Master [[Ketu]] summoned the other Temple Masters of the [[Je'daii Council]] in a [[Hologram/Legends|holoconference]] across Tython, where Ryo informed the other Temple Masters that her research showed that the current storm was of the same strength as the one that had occurred on the day of the [[Tho Yor Arrival]] thousands of years earlier.<ref name=\"DotJ4\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]]</ref>\n\nWhen questioned by Master [[Ruhr]], Ryo voiced her belief that the storm had been caused by the crash of the unknown ship. Kora was alarmed to learn that her daughter Tasha was one of three [[Je'daii Journeyer]]s who were pursuing the [[Tau (individual)|lone survivor]] of the crash into the [[Rift]], an enormous ravine on Tython.<ref name=\"DotJ4\" /> Shortly afterward, as the storm continued to grow in strength, Ryo joined with the other Temple Masters through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and aided Quan-Jang in shifting the balance of the Force on Tython, dissipating the storm's fury. After the threat of the storm had passed, the Council convened to judge the case of the survivor, a powerful [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] warrior named Xesh, and they decided to exile him to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Bogan]] so he could regain his balance.<ref name=\"DOTJ 5\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 5]]</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] later, Kora was attempting to meditate at sunset at Kaleth, but her meditations were interrupted by a holocall from Volnos, who demanded that she forsake the Je'daii and return to Shikaakwa with their daughter as she was still his wife by Shikaakwan law. However, Kora refused, countering that she had dissolved their marriage according to Je'daii law, and she reminded Volnos that his status as a crime lord prevented their family from ever being together. Several days later, after the mad Je'daii [[Daegen Lok]] had been recaptured after his escape from Bogan, Ryo and the other Masters met in conference to sentence Lok. The insane Je'daii demanded that the Masters force his friend [[Hawk Ryo]] to confess what he had seen in the [[Chasm]], a rift in Tython's surface that caused nightmarish hallucinations and was the cause of Lok's insanity.<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 5]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Kora_and_Volnos.png|thumb|130px|Kora and Volnos Ryo]]\n{{Quote|You are a crime lord, Ox, and no Je'daii will serve you.
