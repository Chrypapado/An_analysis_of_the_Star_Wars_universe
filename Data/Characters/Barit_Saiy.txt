During the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], he met and befriended [[Ben Skywalker]] in the Corellian part of Coruscant. Barit told Ben that he was planning an attack on Coruscanti civilians. Something that Ben believed he shouldn't say until Barit attempted to fire on a [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] [[Unidentified Coruscant Police officer (Corellian Embassy riot)|police officer]], forcing Ben to tell his cousin and master, [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], resulting in Barit's arrest. Ben later tried to track him down, but learned that Barit had disappeared.\n\nLater, during his mission to assassinate [[Dur Gejjen]], Ben would change his appearance by coloring his hair and taking the name \"Barit Saiy\" as an alias.\n\nSometime before or after Ben's break from Solo, Barit was released from custody by [[Lon Shevu]] and became his informant, even loaning him a shuttle from the [[University of Coruscant/Legends|University of Coruscant]] where he was most likely a student.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Barit Saiy\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saiy, Barit}}\n[[Category:Corellian nationals]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
