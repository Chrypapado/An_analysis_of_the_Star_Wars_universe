In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Tarkov stumbled upon a large [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] invasion [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|army]] while he was [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] with his son, [[Jaccoba]]. Tarkov and his son then reported the Separatist presence to the nearby towns of [[Warralokk/Legends|Warralokk]], [[Grunnrurr/Legends|Grunnrurr]], and [[Rowrakruk/Legends|Rowrakruk]]. Later, when the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] sent a large detachment of [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|their army]] to protect Kashyyyk, Tarkov and Jaccoba fought alongside the Republic's forces to [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|defend]] Kachirho from the Confederacy.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Tarkov_Sees_Sep_Army.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tarkov and Jaccoba see the Confederate army.]]\nTarkov was a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] woodsmith living near the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]], in the [[Wawaatt Archipelago/Legends|Wawaatt Archipelago]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], during the height of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]],<ref name=\"CW22\">{{CW|22}}</ref> Tarkov took his son [[Jaccoba]] on a [[grantaloupe]]&mdash;a four-legged herbivore&mdash;[[Hunting/Legends|hunt]] that would promote Jaccoba to adulthood.<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> During the hunt, a wayward [[Spear/Legends|spear]] thrown by his son hit a large piece of shrubbery, making a metallic echo. When Tarkov inspected the shrubbery, curious as to why a [[Plant/Legends|plant]] would be making a metallic sound, the Wookiee discovered that the plant was actually a Separatist [[C-9979 landing craft/Legends|landing craft]]. Tarkov and Jaccoba moved to a nearby tree for safety, and as they looked down at the landscape, they saw a large Separatist invasion [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|army]].<ref name=\"CW22\" />\n\nRetreating to the city of [[Kahiyuk/Legends|Kahiyuk]], the pair alerted the nearby towns of [[Warralokk/Legends|Warralokk]], [[Grunnrurr/Legends|Grunnrurr]], and [[Rowrakruk/Legends|Rowrakruk]] to the presence of the Separatists. Soon after, the Republic sent a task force of [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|their army]], under the command of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], to reinforce the Wookiees' defense of Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"db\" /> When the Separatists launched an [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|attack]] on Kachirho, Tarkov and Jaccoba joined the local military, and were among the Wookiees who fought alongside the Republic army to repel the Separatist invaders.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTarkov was somewhat inquisitive; after Jaccoba hit the disguised MTT with his spear, Tarkov scrutinized the \"plant\", wanting to know why it was making metallic sounds.<ref name=\"CW22\" /> Tarkov was also a brave warrior, willing to defend Kachirho from the Separatist invasion force.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTarkov made his first appearance in the [[Clone Wars Chapter 22|twenty-second chapter]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' animated television series. The chapter originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on [[March 22]], [[2005]], and was the second episode in the series' [[Clone Wars: Season Three|third season]], and was released on the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume Two|''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' Volume Two]] DVD. Tarkov was later given his own entry in the [[StarWars.com]] [[Databank (original)|Databank]] and ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', which identified his name and expanded on his biography. Tarkov's Databank entry also mistakenly refers to Kashyyyk as a [[Moon/Legends|moon]].\n\nIt was revealed in the [[Ask Lobot|''Ask the Master'']] Q&A section of ''[[Star Wars Insider 90]]'' that Tarkov was named after [[Genndy Tartakovsky]], the director of ''Star Wars: Clone Wars'', while Jaccoba was named after Tartakovsky's son, [[Jacob Tartakovsky|Jacob]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{CW|22}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|90|Ask Lobot|Ask the Master}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|tarkov|Tarkov|archivedate=20100209174725}} {{1stID}}\n*{{FFCite|y=2014|24|KAS3&ndash;4, ''The Wawaatt Archipelago''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Tarkov\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
