Your father was right. ''Your'' people need their leader.|Luke Skywalker, to Finn Galfridian|Invasion 1}}\n'''Finn Galfridian''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Artorias]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]]. He and his sister [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]] came from a royal background, as his father [[Caled Galfridian|Caled]] and stepmother [[Nina Galfridian|Nina]] were the rulers of Artorias. However, their peaceful existence was shattered when the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], an aggressive race of [[extra-galactic]] invaders, attacked the planet. Finn fought in the [[Battle of Artorias|defense]] of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], an effort which ultimately failed, although he was able to evacuate safely from Artorias due to the timely assistance of the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. The rest of his [[Galfridian family|family]] did not fare as well; his sister and mother were captured, while his father chose to remain on Artorias to lead a [[Artorias resistance|guerrilla resistance]]. During the battle, Finn demonstrated that he was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] when he sensed his mother and sister being captured, and later became a member of the [[New Jedi Order]] under Skywalker's tutelage.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early Life===\nFinn Galfridian was born in [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]] to [[Caled Galfridian]] and his [[Caled Galfridian's first wife|Mother]]. Shortly after giving birth to Finn's sister [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]], Finn's mother died. Caled eventually married [[Nina Galfridian|Nina]] who treated Finn and Kaye as her own children.<ref name=\"Inv09\" />\nIn 25 ABY, Finn built a pair of goggles that linked to his droid's, [[Prowl]], vision, as a gift for his father's birthday.<ref name=\"Inv0\">[[Star Wars: Invasion 0|''Star Wars: Invasion'' 0]]</ref>\n\n===Battle of Artorias===\n{{Quote|We're not going to evacuate. We can organize some of your friends from the war-- We're going to fight, right? There's not that many of them.|Finn, to his father during the Invasion of Artorias|Invasion 1}}\n[[File:Finn_Fights_Boredom.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Finn Galfridian fought boredom on Artorias before the invasion.]]\nLife on [[Artorias]] was idyllic prior to the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Battle of Artorias|invasion]] in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]]; the [[Galfridian family|royal family]] could walk unmolested through the marketplace, and the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] did not even possess a defense force. Finn Galfridian, however, chafed under this peaceful existence, and spent his spare time taking physical risks under the supervision of his [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Prowl]] to alleviate his boredom. It was just after one of his exercises when the Yuuzhan Vong, an aggressive race of [[extra-galactic]] invaders, assaulted the planet. The Yuuzhan Vong had recently attacked [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], destroying the planet of [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal]] in the process.<ref name=\"VecPrime\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref> They had already infiltrated Artorias with their [[Spy/Legends|spies]], hampering efforts to warn the planet of the invasion [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]].<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\nFinn and his father Caled, the [[King/Legends|king]] of Artorias, rushed to the marketplace to rescue Finn's stepmother Nina and sister [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]]. In the meantime, Kaye and her mother Nina were captured by the invaders, although Kaye was able to [[Death/Legends|kill]] one of the [[Warrior caste|warriors]] in the process. Caled and Finn were unable to reach their family, and in the face of Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements, the king ordered the populace to evacuate to the [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]]. Although the two Galfridians and the evacuees were able to reach the [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]], the Yuuzhan Vong kept the building under siege. The refugees were unable to escape on the [[Starship/Legends|ships]] in the hangar since they had been sabotaged by a Yuuzhan Vong agent. Caled and Finn prepared themselves for the impending assault, but were rescued by the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who had killed the besiegers.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />[[File:Artorias_Vong_attack.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Finn and his Father during the [[Battle of Artorias]].]]\n\nSkywalker offered to evacuate everyone in the hangar, but Caled personally refused to come along; citing his responsibility to the defense of his kingdom, he organized a strike team to attack the invaders. When Finn demanded to come along with the attack force, his father informed him that he now had to lead the Artorian people. As the refugees piled onto [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[C-3 passenger liner|evacuation ships]], Finn protested to Skywalker that he had no idea how to lead, but Skywalker assured him that if he pretended to know what he was doing, the people would follow him. Finn also demonstrated his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force affinity]] to Skywalker when he sensed his mother and sister being herded toward a Yuuzhan Vong [[slaveship]]. This prompted the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master to ask Finn to come to his [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi academy]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], which Finn accepted. As the ships fled from Artorias, Finn knew there was no going back.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\n===Training on Yavin 4===\n{{Quote|Finn's training will not be rushed.

He must be allowed to reach his full potential.|Luke Skywalker|Invasion 2}}\n[[File:Finn's_Jedi_training.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Finn follows the Jedi path.]]\nWhile on Yavin 4, Finn began his training under the watchful eye of Master Skywalker. After much practice Finn was able to [[Telekinesis/Legends|lift]] a rock using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Master Skywalker congratulated the young Jedi, then placed a large boulder on the rock and told Finn to pick the rock up again. Four Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]]&mdash;[[Lowbacca]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]], [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], and [[Anakin Solo]]&mdash;took pity on him and offered to let him train with them. Despite some initial awkwardness around Jaina, Finn quickly showed his mettle in a practice [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]] with her. Jaina warned Finn of the dangers of hatred and of falling to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] after he expressed his worry and anger at fate of his planet and family. They were interrupted by Anakin Solo, who had heard a large noise issuing from a nearby cave. The Padawans went to investigate, and Finn ordered Prowl to scope out the cave while he monitored the droid's progress through his goggles, which could see through Prowl's photoreceptors.<ref name=\"Inv2\">[[Invasion 2|''Invasion'' 2]]</ref>\n\nA large [[Tuk'ata/Legends|Tuk'ata]] ran out of the cave toward the frozen Finn. Jacen was able to comfort the maddened animal by treating a wound it had sustained, and the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] hound returned to its cave. Finn admonished himself for freezing in the face of danger, and expressed further anger toward the Yuuzhan Vong, which worried Skywalker. The Jedi Master discussed the situation with fellow Masters [[Kyp Durron]] and [[Lar Le'Ung]]. After receiving news of a Yuuzhan Vong attack on the planet [[Rychel]], Skywalker resolved to take Finn along, especially after Finn appeared before the Masters and showed them that he had lifted Skywalker's boulder.<ref name=\"Inv2\" />\n\n===Battle of Rychel===\n{{Quote|Learn.|Finn Galfridian to [[Tsalok]] after sparing his life.|Invasion 3}}\n[[File:LarFinnRychel.png|thumb|left|250px|Finn Galfridian and Lar Le'Ung during the [[Evacuation of Rychel]].]]\nFinn participated in the [[Evacuation of Rychel|evacuation]] of Rychel's citizens. Finn looked to Master Skywalker and was amazed by his abilities. He and Master Le'Ung attempted to stop the fearsome Siege beasts [[Tu-Scart]] and [[Sgauru]], when they felt the creatures emanating fear. Master Le'Ung began to rally the New Republic troops against the beasts but was struck from behind by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] Commander [[Tsalok]]. Finn then took up Master Le'Ung's fallen [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and continued to rally the troops. While the New Republic forces were retreating Finn noticed a small boy in a building and went to rescue him. After blasting two [[Chazrach]] Finn found the boy along with several others and while leading them out of the building was confronted by Tsalok. Finn attempted to hold off the warrior but during their duel Sgauru fell on the building, destroying it.<ref name=\"Inv3\">[[Invasion 3|''Invasion'' 3]]</ref>[[File:FinnSparesTsalok.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Finn Galfridian spares the life of Tsalok on Rychel.]]\n\nFinn managed to save his life as well as the refugees by using the Force to suspend the debris. Finn guided the refugees to the evacuation ships than went back to Tsalok who was now trapped beneath the debris. Luke watching, expected Finn to kill the warrior but to his surprise Finn cut away the debris and freed the warrior and told him to learn. Finn met up with Master Skywalker on an evacuation ship, and was congratulated by the Jedi Master for his actions.<ref name=\"Inv3\" />\n\n===Mission to Nar Shaddaa===\n{{Quote|You want to put the blaster down.''\"<br />\"''You want to practice your Jedi mind trick.|Finn and Han Solo|Invasion 4}}\n[[File:Finn_Falcon.png|thumb|right|300px|Finn joins the Solos to Nar Shaddaa.]]\nAfter the battle Finn was sent by Master Skywalker to accompany [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Solo]], her children, and Lowbacca to obtain information from a smuggler on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. After exploring the planet Finn went back to the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] to get his droid Prowl. Upon returning to the ''Falcon'' Finn sensed someone entering it. Finn drew his blaster intending to stop the intruder but was stopped by a blaster at his back. Finn attempted to use a Jedi mind trick but it failed against the interloper who turned out to be [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who was their contact.\n\nLeia came back and admonished Han for his treatment of Finn. After Finn left, Han and Leia discussed the mission to buy information about Yuuzhan Vong spies in the galaxy and also about how Han should forgive Anakin for [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca's]] death. Finn came back after this and revealed he had heard everything they said through Prowl. Finn told Han that he should forgive Anakin, and that he believed his father was dead. Han decided that Finn and Prowl would be perfect to find out the information they needed.<ref name=\"Inv4\">[[Invasion 4|''Invasion'' 4]]</ref>\n\nAfter Jacen and Lowbacca discovered that [[Dahal]] knew who was selling the information, Finn and Prowl covertly followed him. While following Dahal, Finn bumped into a [[Dray|strange man]]. The man appeared to be intrigued by Finn's face but before Finn could find out who he was, Prowl warned that Dahal was nearing Finn's position. As the man walked away he called Finn by name, but Finn didn't notice. Because of that delay Dahal was now directly behind Finn so to avoid being caught he jumped off the street and held onto a sign. He then went back to the ''Millennium Falcon'' to tell everyone that he had seen Dahal talking to a [[Vratix/Legends|Vratix]]. They then went to see Dahal and the Vratix [[Spraug]]. After they got a [[Dray's holocron|holocron]] Leia turned it on and Finn immediately recognized the face he saw as [[Dulac]], who had known Finn since he was a small child.<ref name=\"Inv5\">[[Invasion 5|''Invasion'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===Deciphering the holocron===\n{{Quote| ''I said'' it wasn't ''working''.

Finn insisted on going back to Artorias to warn his father of the danger Dulac posed. Jacen and Luke tried to convince him not to go, but Finn remained steadfast. As Finn, followed by Jaina, walked out the room, the holocron faltered and shut down.<ref name=\"Inv6\">[[Invasion: Rescues 1|''Invasion: Rescues'' 1]]</ref>\n\nOutside, on the steps of one of Yavin 4's temples, Jaina asked Finn how he planned on saving his father. Finn told her he hadn't yet thought of a plan and hoped to come up with one along the way. At this point Master Skywalker interrupted their conversation and asked to speak with Finn privately. After Jaina had left, Skywalker asked Finn to take a look at the holocron. As soon as Finn touched the holocron it activated, confirming Luke's suspicion that the holocron was linked to him somehow and that it was meant for him. He asked Finn to see if he could learn more from the holocron.\n\nWhen Master Skywalker left the holocron showed the face of Dray, the strange man Finn had encountered on Nar Shaddaa. Dray had foreseen that he and Finn would meet and had arranged for the holocron to make its way to Finn. He warned Finn of things to come and told him that he must travel to Artorias. When Jaina came back to see how he was doing the image changed back to that of Dulac.<ref name=\"Inv6\" />\n\nThat night, Finn sneaked into the Academy's shipyards, but when he neared a suitable ship, he found Jaina and Jacen already waiting for him, intent on accompanying him to Artorias. Luke Skywalker revealed himself as well and told them he knew he couldn't stop them from leaving, for he too once risked everything to save his own [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|father]]. Master Skywalker warned them to be careful and gave Finn the lightsaber of Master Le'Ung, which he deemed Finn worthy of after the Battle of Rychel.<ref name=\"Inv6\" />\n\n===Race to Artorias===\n{{Quote|That's why we have to crash.

Finn told them of a [[Artorian safe haven|base]] hidden beneath the [[Great Sea of Artorias]]. If they would pretend to crash into the sea, they would be able to make their way to the base and use Prowl to search for Finn's father on Artorias' surface.<ref name=\"Inv7\">[[Invasion: Rescues 2|''Invasion: Rescues'' 2]]</ref>\n\nWhen Jaina brought the ship out of hyperspace, the trio was surprised by the lack of Yuuzhan Vong ship defending Artorias. They were, however, attacked by another type of defense, [[grutchin]]s. The three Jedi quickly donned their [[Enviro-suit|pressure suits]] as the bugs were gnawing through the ship's hull. Jacen manned the guns to fight off the grutchins, but a few had already attached themselves to the hull. Borrowing Jaina's lightsaber, Finn made his way outside with Prowl and fought off the Grutchins until the ship neared Artorias' atmosphere. The ship's power diverters had been heavily damaged and the ship had become steer less, Jaina warned him to get inside the ship quickly or he would burn up in the atmosphere. Finn quickly dispatched of the last grutchins and made his way into the ship.<ref name=\"Inv7\" />\n\nAfter the ship crashed into the sea, Finn piloted the ship towards the base. They were met with blaster fire as the [[Artorias resistance]] didn't know of their coming. The situation was quickly resolved when [[Sparky]] recognized Finn. Finn immediately asked after his father, and Sparky told him he was with Dulac.<ref name=\"Inv7\" />\n\n[[File:Inv08-CaledPoisoned.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Finn holds his wounded father.]]Finn, Jaina, Jacen, and Prowl hurried through the base to find Caled and Dulac. Prowl arrived first, but Dulac had already revealed himself to the King and attacked him. On Finn's command, Prowl shot the Yuuzhan Vong. Dulac had one final ace up his sleeve though, a [[plaeryin bol]]. He fired the venom from the bol at Caled, which burned away at the King's face. Jacen and Jaina quickly dispatched Dulac with their lightsabers, while Finn concerned himself with his heavily wounded father.<ref name=\"Inv8\">[[Invasion: Rescues 3|''Invasion: Rescues'' 3]]</ref>\n\n===A Father's Goodbye===\n{{Quote|You came.

Finn went to see his father who was happy to find out his son was a Jedi apprentice, and wanted to see Finn's lightsaber. Caled admired the weapon and told his son that he knew there was anger in him and told him not to strike out with it. He proceeded to tell Finn the story about how he met Nina. It was shortly after his first wife, the mother of Finn and Kaye, had died and he and a group of soldiers went to remove a slaver named [[Dowron]] from the planet. Dowron had Nina as a slave and after Caled freed her she killed Dowron with her bare hands. He then admitted that at the time he was angry about the loss of his first wife and was looking only to fight the bad of Artorias instead of fostering the good in it, and that only Nina's unconditional love for him and his children quieted his anger.<ref name=\"Inv09\" />\n\nHe then confided in Finn that he and Nina always knew that Kaye would be a leader but that they did not know what Finn would do, however he was proud that Finn was becoming a Jedi. Caled urged Finn to leave Artorias because the attacks of the [[Artorias resistance|Resistance]] were futile. Finn disagreed and responded by telling him about how the Yuuzhan Vong's lack of a Force signature led to the death of Jedi Master Lar Le'Ung during the Evacuation of Rychel and that he could in fact [[Vongsense|sense]] the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Inv09\" /> Finn believed he was a freak because of this ability but his father assured him that he was not, and thought that maybe it was a gift. Finn apologized for not getting there soon enough but Caled responded by saying that he was grateful to see him one last time. Caled then told Finn to leave so he could make a recording with Prowl. After Caled finished the recording Finn returned and placed his hand on his father. The King of Artorias was now dead.<ref name=\"Inv10\">[[Invasion: Rescues 5|''Invasion: Rescues'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===New Journey===\n{{Quote|Every future I see, you are there is something about you...

On the return trip, Dray contacted Finn through the holocron again and told him that his past was now behind him and that he must come to him to learn his purpose. Jacen then entered and voiced his suspicion, that the holocron worked only for Finn, which Finn confirmed. Jacen assured Finn that no matter what his destiny, he and Jaina would always be there to help if he needed it.<ref name=\"Inv11\" />\n[[File:Finn_Vong_chestburster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Finn is subdued by a Yuuzhan Vong creature.]]\nThe Solo's dropped Finn off of at Nar Shaddaa. Before Finn left he told his friends that he would return to the Academy as soon as possible. Just as Finn began to search for Dray he felt something wrong and collapsed as something spasmed in his chest then fell unconscious. Luckily for him Dray found him and Prowl explained what happened. Dray was able to wake Finn and told him of the visions he had about the young Jedi. Dray could sense a loss in Finn and Finn told him about how he lost his father to the Yuuzhan Vong in the holocron. Finn asked how Dray knew of Dulac and Dray told him that he saw it in his visions of Finn. He also saw visions of the future including the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]] as well as the [[Invasion of Yavin 4|destruction of the Jedi Praxeum]]. He foresaw that the Galaxy and the Jedi would survive these atrocities but not a weapon that the Yuuzhan Vong were currently creating, and that Finn was the only one who could stand against this weapon. When Finn suggested to alert Master Skywalker to the threat Dray told him no because he and Skywalker did not see eye to eye. Dray told Finn that if Skywalker pooled all of the Jedi to stand against this threat then there would be no one to stop the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Inv11\" />\n\n===Mission to Coruscant===\n{{Quote|Is it wrong that I'm almost as angry with the New Republic as I am with the Yuuzhan Vong?|Finn to Dray|Invasion: Revelations 1}}\n[[File:FinnGuardMindTrick.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Finn Galfridian uses a [[Mind trick/Legends|Mind trick]] on [[Palace Guard (New Republic)|Palace Guards]].]]Finn began his apprenticeship to Dray, and upgraded the weapons on Prowl. After hearing on the Holonet about Master Skywalker [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|fighting on Dantooine]], Finn became upset at his inaction. Dray told Finn that he was allowed to feel angry and that he would save the Galaxy soon. While comforting Finn, Dray had a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] of [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Borsk Fey'lya]], being attacked by Yuuzhan Vong. Dray told Finn of the vision and that Finn was going to stop it.<ref name=\"Inv12\">[[Invasion: Revelations 1|''Invasion: Revelations'' 1]]</ref>\n\nWhile on the way to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] Finn told Dray that he did not want to kill anyone, but Dray told him that he believed the Yuuzhan Vong were not really alive, so Finn wouldn't really be killing them. After arriving on Coruscant, Finn used Jedi [[Mind trick/Legends|Mind tricks]] on the Palace Guards to enter the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]]. Finn quickly found Fey'lya, who happened to be discussing Finn's home world Artorias. Finn fell from his vantage point and was attacked by Senate Guards, however he used the Force to push them away. Before Finn could confront Fey'lya, he was attacked by the Imperial ambassador, [[Yarmond]]. Before Finn fell unconscious he sensed that Yarmond was the Yuuzhan Vong that Dray had envisioned.<ref name=\"Inv12\" />\n\nFinn regained consciousness in the confines of a prison cell and was interrogated by Chief of State Fey'lya. Finn tried to explain that he was there to protect the Chief of State, but Borsk believed him to be an assassin and left. Not long after Fey'lya left, Finn was broken out by Dray and Prowl. After escaping, Finn told Dray about Yarmond being the Yuuzhan Vong. Dray told Finn that he would find Yarmond while Finn collected his gear. Before they separated Finn asked if Fey'lya was worth saving and Dray responded that the New Republic needed a figurehead, so as not to be destabilized.<ref name=\"Inv13\">[[Invasion: Revelations 2|''Invasion: Revelations'' 2]]</ref>\n\nFinn and Prowl returned to the Imperial palace to retrieve his goggles and lightsaber. To cause a distraction Prowl fired an explosive blast, however the guards found Finn anyway. Finn tried to use a Jedi mind trick on the Guard Captain [[Kopri]], but her will was too strong. Finn realized there was no way to come across innocent so he ordered Prowl to cause a diversion. Prowl fired again and Finn used the distraction to Force break the door open. Before he could enter the palace, Kopri confronted him again. Finn told her that he wasn't an assassin but Kopri shot him and Finn fell off the walkway, but managed to grab onto its bottom. After the guards left to search for Prowl, Finn jumped back up and ran into the palace. Once inside Finn found his gear and eavesdropped on Borsk and [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Bylsma]]. Bylsma was trying to convince Borsk that the Yuuzhan Vong were going to attack [[Shramar]], but Borsk dismissed the Admiral's concern as Yarmond, Shramar's ambassador, told him that the problem was the Artorian refugees Shramar had accepted. Bylsma pleaded to Borsk that thousands of refugees would die but Borsk told the admiral it was a regional concern, and with that Finn ignited his lightsaber.<ref name=\"Inv14\">[[Invasion: Revelations 3|''Invasion: Revelations'' 3]]</ref>\n\nHe confronted Fey'lya and threatened him with his lightsaber. Finn tried to persuade the Chief of State that the Yuuzhan Vong invasion was a serious threat, but Fey'lya dismissed it as a political ploy. His guards, hearing the confrontation, entered the quarters but Finn used the Force to fling a couch at them. He then slashed open a window, and fled on the back of his droid, Prowl. Kopri followed him out the window, using a [[flutter pack]] to fly. She managed to collide with Finn, knock both of them to the ground. The guard drew her blaster and aimed it at Finn, but he was able to convince her that he wasn't an assassin and was actually trying to save Fey'lya from the Yuuzhan Vong assassin, who was disguised as Yarmond. Kopri decided to investigate the Imperial, and Finn accompanied her to the ambassador's quarters. When the entered, they were confronted by Yarmond and [[Zakar (Yuuzhan Vong)|Zakar]]. Before the Yuuzhan Vong could take away their prisoners, Dray arrived and slew Zakar.<ref name=\"SWI15\">[[Invasion: Revelations 4|''Invasion: Revelations'' 4]]</ref>\n\nDray revealed his plan to eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong and take over the galaxy himself. He commanded Finn to kill Yarmond and Kopri. Finn turned his back on Dray and left the room with Kopri. They fled toward a nearby hangar and Kopri called in palace guards to take down Dray. They were no match for Dray and were all killed by [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]. As Finn approached a ship, Prowl saw Dray throw his lightsaber at Finn, and flew into its path, sacrificing himself to save his owner. Once on board, Kopri attempted to take off, but couldn't because the ship was held by Dray with the Force. Finn was able to knock Dray back by using the Force, and the ship fled Coruscant.

However, Finn was very loyal to his family and was willing to put himself in danger to see them to safety, wishing to join his father's strike force but staying on Artorias to rescue his captured mother and sister.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\nWhile training on Yavin 4, Finn developed a crush on his fellow Padawan, Jaina Solo. Although tongue-tied and awkward at first, he warmed up to her and told her of his experiences fighting the Yuuzhan Vong.
