While on Delaya, Dray and [[J'er Nahj]], a Human male, looked after a [[Youngling/Legends|young]] boy [[Shell (Alderaanian)|Shell]], who had been orphaned after the attack. Dray was a member and a leader of a [[Alderaanian faction|group of Alderaanian refugees]] whose members loathed [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], as her actions had caused Alderaan to become involved with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], which in turn led to Alderaan's involvement in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], and later its destruction. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], the group captured Organa as part of a plan to turn the Princess in to the Empire, and to be rewarded with a new planet for Alderaanian refugees. However, the Imperials betrayed Dray's group, which led to her [[Death/Legends|death]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|She's paid nothing&hellip;|Halle Dray, referring to Leia Organa|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Halle Dray lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a major [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] conflict fought between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] by the Galactic Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]] at the order of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] in order to demonstrate the destructive firepower of the battlestation on a world sympathetic to the Rebels, resulting in the complete annihilation of Alderaan and its inhabitants. Dray was off-world when the Destruction of Alderaan occurred, and she afterward fled to the planet [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]] in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]], which had been the sister world of Alderaan before the latter's demise. Dray became one of the leaders of a [[Alderaanian faction|group of Alderaanian refugees]] who loathed [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of the [[House of Organa/Legends|Royal House of Alderaan]], as her actions had gotten Alderaan involved with the Rebellion, which in turn caused Alderaan's involvement in the Galactic Civil War and its subsequent destruction.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\nAfter her homeworld's end, Dray and [[J'er Nahj]], a Human male, looked after a [[Youngling/Legends|young]] boy named [[Shell (Alderaanian)|Shell]], an orphan of the attack. Later,<ref name=\"Hostage\" /> in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]],<ref name=\"TERC\" /> Dray and her followers confronted Organa before the Princess participated in a meeting with Alderaanian survivor groups to entice them to join the Rebel Alliance. Dray accused her of loving war, and the group kidnapped Organa by tossing her into a [[Landspeeder/Legends|speeder truck]]. Dray and her followers hoped to turn Organa in to the Empire in exchange for a new planet for Alderaanian refugees. While in custody, Organa tried to escape, but the faction stopped her. When they arrived at an abandoned building, Dray and her followers contacted the Imperials and turned in Organa for the reward for which they had long hoped. However, the Imperial party&mdash;comprised of four [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]]&mdash;betrayed Dray and her followers, and they [[Death/Legends|killed]] most of the group, including Dray, with [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]].<ref name=\"Hostage\" /> Organa, on the other hand, would be later rescued by Rebel forces.<ref name=\"RFR\">''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|No, he loved the glory of war.|Halle Dray, discussing [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]] with Leia Organa|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\nHalle Dray was a determined woman who wanted peace for herself as well as her fellow Alderaanians. She only felt hate toward the [[House of Organa/Legends|Organa family]], as she believed that they had ruined many of Alderaanians' lives as well as hers. Dray was also one of the leaders of a group of Alderaanian refugees who loathed Princess Leia Organa, as her actions had cost Alderaan its destruction. Dray's leadership in the group contributed to the downfall of the faction, leaving most of the group dead, due to the fact that Dray had not suspected that the Empire would betray them.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHalle Dray first appeared in the novel ''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'', released in [[2008]].
