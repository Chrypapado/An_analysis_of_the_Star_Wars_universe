Serving the Republic during the [[Battle of Malastare Narrows]], he was given an [[admiral]]'s commission in the [[Galactic Republic Navy|Republic Navy]] following the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars]], assigned to [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Yularen overcame an initially-rocky relationship with his [[Jedi]] superior to successfully combat the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in several battles throughout the conflict, including [[Battle of Christophsis|Christophsis]], the [[Battle of the Kaliida Nebula|Kaliida Nebula]], and [[Second Battle of Geonosis|Geonosis]]. Narrowly escaping the [[Battle of Sullust|destruction]] of his [[flagship]], the ''[[Resolute]]'', by [[20 BBY]] he was considered one of the preeminent [[Republic officer|naval officers]] of the time.\n\nWith the Republic's transition into the Galactic Empire, Yularen resigned his commission in favor of becoming a [[colonel]] in the [[Imperial Security Bureau]], and in this capacity rooted out sedition in the [[Imperial Senate]] as well as served as a liason to the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]]. Following the events of the [[Berch Teller campaign]], Yularen was eventually promoted to head the reformed NIA, with the rank of [[Deputy Director]]. However, he continued playing an important role in the ISB, and became an early ally of the [[Chiss]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] as he rose through the ranks of the [[Imperial Navy]], assisting him in his campaigns against the rebel agent [[Nevil Cygni]].\n\nIn response to the growing rebellion, Colonel Yularen assisted now-[[Grand Admiral]] Thrawn in hunting for the rebel mole [[Fulcrum]], who leaked Imperial intelligence to the rebels. Working with Thrawn, Yularen discovered that the rebel mole was his former student [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus]]. Following the [[Battle of Scarif]], Yularen was one of the [[Imperial officer|officers]] assigned to the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]], where he was [[Death|killed]] during the [[Battle of Yavin]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n{{Quote|He tore our ships apart.

He participated in the [[Battle of Malastare Narrows]], a conflict in which a [[fleet]] organized by the [[Corporate Alliance]] blockaded the planet [[Malastare]]. Despite his best efforts, the enemy fleet, led by the brilliant [[Harch]] tactician [[Admiral]] [[Trench]], proved impossible to break, and Yularen lost many of his own forces. Eventually, a dispatched [[Jedi]] task force turned the tide of the battle, defeating the Corporate fleet, vaporizing Trench's [[flagship]], and seemingly [[Death|killing]] him in the process. Despite the victory, Yularen left the battle with a lasting fear of the Admiral's tactical capabilities.<ref name=\"Cat and Mouse\">{{TCW|Cat and Mouse}}</ref> He served in the Republic [[Senate Bureau of Intelligence]] for a time, until he retired.<ref name=\"SWCT\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|Of all the Jedi, why did I have to end up with Skywalker?|Wullf Yularen, on his assignment to Anakin Skywalker's fleet during the Clone Wars|audio=OfAllTheJedi-CoD.ogg|Cargo of Doom}}\nFollowing the [[First Battle of Geonosis|eruption]] of the Clone Wars in [[22 BBY]] and the formation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]],<ref name=\"AotC\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] encouraged Yularen to join the brand new Republic Navy, awarding him the rank of Admiral, making him the youngest member of the naval corps to achieve this rank.<ref name=\"SWCT\" /> Since a war bargain struck between the [[Jedi Order]] and Chancellor ensured that the new [[Jedi General]]s would be paired with veteran naval officers, Admiral Yularen was assigned to [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]].<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Initially in command of a [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]], this [[starship]] heavily damaged in the [[Battle of Teth]], after which he would be posted to the cruiser ''[[Resolute]]'', the flagship of [[General]] [[Skywalker's fleet]].<ref name=\"TCW film\" />\n\n====Christophsis and Teth====\n[[File:Yularenblockade.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Yularen facing the blockade over Christophsis]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Christophsis]], Yularen initially failed to break through the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] blockade of the [[Christophsis|planet]] with supplies for [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa's]] force trapped on the planet. Recognizing his insignia on the Separatist flagship, the [[Providence-class Dreadnought|dreadnought]] ''[[Invincible]]'', Yularen concluded that Trench had survived at [[Malastare]] and was facing him once again. Fearing his capabilities, Yularen regrouped on the far side of [[Leesis]], Christophsis' moon. Reinforced by [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s ''[[Negotiator]]'', Yularen personally participated in a mercy mission aboard a new model of [[IPV-2C Stealth Corvette|stealth ship]] to provide relief to the planet below.<ref name=\"Cat and Mouse\" />\n\nThe ship, fitted with an experimental [[cloaking device]], easily slipped past the blockade. However, Trench, emboldened by the lull in the fighting, ordered a flight of [[Hyena-class Droid Fighter/Bomber|Hyena bombers]] to attack Organa's position on the planet's surface in an attempt to draw out the Republic force and destroy it. Despite Kenobi's preparations, Yularen recognized that any counterattack would result in heavy casualties for their fleet. The Jedi, Skywalker, was able to outmaneuver Trench's attacks and destroy the ''Invincible''. Despite his initial skepticism and friction with the Jedi, the Admiral was impressed with Skywalker's unconventionality, who commented that they made a good team.<ref name=\"Cat and Mouse\" /> Yularen was later forced to withdraw due to a renewed Separatist blockade in [[orbit]], but the destruction of the Separatist [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] and ensuing surrender of General [[Whorm Loathsom]] allowed him to return with Master [[Yoda]]'s reinforcements and secure a Republic victory.<ref name=\"TCW film\" />\n\nYularen then assisted General Kenobi in rescuing what was left of [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]]'s [[Torrent Company|troops]] holed up at [[Teth]]'s [[B'omarr Order Monastery|B'omarr Monastery]]. He tried to allow Skywalker, his [[padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]]'s son, [[Rotta]] to land on his ship but were unable to due to [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]] attacking the ship's hangar.<ref name=\"TCW film\" />\n\n====Hunt for Grievous====\n[[File:Admiral_Yularen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Yularen during the search for the ''Malevolence'']]\nYularen played a pivotal role in the search and destruction of General [[Grievous]]'s secret weapon, the [[Subjugator-class heavy cruiser|warship]] ''[[Malevolence]]''.<ref name=\"Rising Malevolence\" /> After it was revealed Grievous planned to [[Battle of the Kaliida Nebula|attack]] the undefended [[Kaliida Shoals Medical Center]], Yularen briefed the [[Clone trooper pilot|pilots]] of [[Shadow Squadron]], flying [[BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber]]s, for their strike on the ship.

Yularen spoke to the passengers onboard through the comlink and asked [[Trace Martez]] what she was doing in military airspace. He threatened to confiscate her [[starpilot license]], but Ahsoka Tano switched off the comlink and the ship flew off. Yularen then informed General Skywalker that it was some rookie pilot on their first maneuvers. He said that he was about to send a detachment to arrest them until Skywalker sensed Ahsoka's presence and decided to let them fly off.<ref name=\"Deal No Deal\">{{TCW|Deal No Deal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AhsokaTanoAndBoKatan.png|thumb|right|250px|Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze contact the Republic Military for assistance.]]\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Yularen would take an interest in [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and his new right-hand man \"Admiral Enigma,\" who was actually the former Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]]. After receiving intelligence that Dooku and Admiral Enigma had been sighted on a ''Providence''-class dreadnought that was planning to attack [[Taris]], Yularen informed the [[Jedi High Council]], which had been engrossed in a meeting to discuss rescuing Vos. Using Admiral Yularen's information, the Council decided to rescue Vos and agreed to pardon the former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Asajj Ventress]] if she agreed to take part in the [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|rescue mission]]. While the rescue mission was successful, Vos had secretly turned to the [[Dark side of the Force|Dark Side]] and become Dooku's newest [[Sith]] apprentice.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>\n\n===Under the Galactic Empire===\n====Brief Imperial admiral====\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine [[Proclamation of the New Order|transitioned]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]], with himself as [[Galactic Emperor]].<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Yularen continued to serve as an admiral within the [[Imperial Military]], albeit briefly. Although the [[Corporate Sector Authority]] supported the Confederacy during the Clone Wars, the Authority was allowed to to expand to tens of thousands of [[star system]]s by the Emperor, rather than being brought under Imperial control. As such, the Empire maintained a cooperative relationship with the CSA, and shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, Admiral Yularen conducted a [[Campaign in the Corporate Sector|campaign]] in the Corporate Sector against [[pirate]]s that were launching raids.<ref name=\"BMF 18\">{{BuildFalconCite|18|Guide to the Galaxy|Sectors of the Galaxy}}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Security Bureau====\nEventually with this [[New Order]], Yularen resigned his admiral's commission in favor of pursuing a career with the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]]'s [[Imperial Security Bureau]] (ISB) with the rank of [[colonel]]. His first assignment was heading a division whose purpose was to expose instances of [[Treason|sedition]] in the [[Imperial Senate]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nBy [[14 BBY]],<ref name=\"Tarkin date\">{{TarkinDate}}</ref> the fifth [[Standard year|year]] of the Empire's [[Imperial Era|reign]], Yularen had been appointed the head liaison between the ISB and its main rival, the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]], and was responsible for ensuring cooperation between the Empire's different intelligence agencies.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> During this time, he personally reviewed the reports of Naval Intelligence operative [[Commander]] [[Gallius Rax]], bypassing NIA [[Vice Admiral]]s [[Dodd Rancit]] and [[Terrinald Screed]].<ref name=\"LD\" /> Along with his direct superior, [[Harus Ison]], he represented the ISB on Coruscant when [[Moff]] Wilhuff Tarkin arrived to give his report about the [[Attack on Sentinel Base|attack]] on [[Sentinel Base]]. As the [[Berch Teller campaign]] progressed, he continued to play an active role in the Imperial response from Coruscant, conferring with both Tarkin and the [[Joint Chiefs]]. After the death of Vice Admiral Rancit at Carida, the Emperor promoted Yularen to replace his rival's former role as head of the NIA when it was folded under [[Imperial Intelligence]], with the position of [[Deputy Director]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> In this role, he continued to receive Gallius Rax's top-secret intelligence reports, which were marked \"eyes only\" for himself.<ref name=\"LD\" /> By [[4 BBY]], Yularen had returned to the ISB, again with the rank of colonel.<ref name=\"Epic Battles\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''</ref> ISB [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], Yularen's \"star pupil\" from the [[Imperial Academy]],<ref name=\"TIE\" /> was after a crew of insurgents known as the [[Spectres]], and answered to Yularen at this time.<ref name=\"Epic Battles\" />\n\n====Nightswan's campaign====\n=====Visiting the Alisandre Hotel=====\n[[File:Alisandre_Hotel_ballroom.png|thumb|right|250px|Yularen attending the Ascension Week ball at the Alisandre Hotel]]\nFollowing the [[Dromedar hijacking|''Dromedar'' hijacking]], Colonel Yularen accompanied the [[Lothal]] Senator [[Domus Renking]], the [[Chiss]] [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and [[Ensign]] [[Eli N. Vanto|Eli Vanto]] during an [[Ascension Week]] ball at the [[Alisandre Hotel]] on Coruscant. Renking introduced Yularen and his colleagues to one of his aides [[Arihnda Pryce]], who worked at one of Renking's citizen assistance offices. Yularen recounted the story of how Thrawn and Vanto single-handedly captured a pirate ship and most of its crew, and saved a valuable shipment of [[tibanna]] gas. While Thrawn was modest about his achievements, Yularen pointed out that Thrawn and his crew were outnumbered by the pirates. When Yularen asked Vanto if he was stating the case, Vanto replied in the affirmative but remained despondent about his lack of promotion.<ref name=\"Thrawn\">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>\n\nWhile making conversation with Renking and Pryce, Yularen announced that he had to leave to attend to business with \"friends in high places.\" Before leaving, Yularen took care to introduce Thrawn to other Imperial officials and senators. Another ulterior motive of Yularen's social call was to help Thrawn build connections with sympathetic civilian officials in order to counterweight the [[High Command]] in the event they decided to court martial Thrawn for his ingenious but unorthodox tactics on the ''Dromedar''. Thrawn and Yularen then discussed the matter that twelve of the tibanna cylinders recovered aboard the ''Dromear'' had been emptied. Yularen deduced that the insurgent leader [[Nevil Cygni]], who was the insurgent leader Nightswan, had somehow found a way to get the gas out of the cylinders. While Thrawn was upset, Yularen reassured the Chiss that he would be welcome in the Imperial Security Bureau in the event that the Navy did not want him. Fortunately for Thrawn, he was cleared by the court martial panel, and was subsequently promoted to Captain.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n=====Yinchom Dojo and Higher Skies=====\n{{Quote|Don't worry about Higher Skies. Whatever is there, we'll find it.|Colonel Wullf Yularen|Thrawn (novel)}}\n[[File:Brook_Roenton.png|thumb|left|250px|Colonel Yularen with Captain Thrawn and Ensign Vanto investigated the Yinchom Dojo.]]\nContinued their investigation into [[Nightswan's campaign]], Captain Thrawn and Ensign Vanto visited Colonel Yularen's office to seek his help on investigating the wily Nightswan. Yularen shared Thrawn's dismay that Commander [[Alfren Cheno]] had taken the fall to protect Thrawn following the [[Battle over Umbara]]. Yularen informed Thrawn that he had found multiple references to Nightswan in a range of activities including metal smuggling, antique purchases, and the instigation of protests and unrest. However, he was unable to uncover the insurgent leader's identity. Unable to discern Nightswan's motives, Yularen dismissed him as a troublemaker.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn speculated that Nightswan was motivated by the usurpation of some personal or mining interests. Following the [[Circle Bay mayor's office protest]], Yularen convinced Thrawn and Vanto to accompany him and the ISB Officers [[Roenton]] and [[Brook]] on a visit to the dojos that trained bodyguards for Imperial Senators. One of these dojos that Colonel Yularen and his comrades visited was the [[Yinchom Dojo]], which was owned by the [[Togorian]] [[H'sishi]]. Over the past five years, thirty senators had sent their bodyguards to Yinchom Dojo for training. At the dojo, they met Pryce again, whom they had encountered earlier at the Alisandre [[Hotel]]. After losing her job with Senator Renking, Pryce had found work at the [[Higher Skies Advocacy Group]]. One of the martial art instructors [[Juahir Madras]] at the dojo was a friend of [[Driller MarDapp]], the leader of Higher Skies. Madras was also part of Driller's [[Imperial espionage operation|spy ring]], which worked for Nightswan.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhen H'sishi arrived, Yularen introduced himself and his companions. He also asked H'sishi whether she had record on government contracts and bodyguard training. Before H'sishi went to fetch the documents, Thrawn convinced H'sishi to engage in a sparring session with sticks. Following the visit, Thrawn related his observations of the dojo to Yularen. He noted that Instructor Madras had ignored them until H'sishi had ordered her to stop. Thrawn also explained that Pryce had alerted him about the advocacy group Higher Skies and that he had sparred with H'sishi to ascertain if she had any hostile intentions. While Thrawn cleared H'sishi of any malevolent intent, he convinced Yularen to investigate Higher Skies.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Hatching_a_Plan_AtG.png|thumb|right|250px|Colonel Yularen investigated Higher Skies at Thrawn's urging.]]\nFollowing the Yinchom visit, Thrawn secretly met with Pryce, who offered to provide the Imperials with information about Higher Skies' espionage activities in return for immunity. Thrawn agreed to petition Yularen to protect Pryce in return for spying on her colleagues. Acting under Thrawn and Yularen's instructions, Pryce baited Moff [[Ghadi]] by offering to provide him with information that Higher Skies had illegally obtained about [[Grand Moff]] Wilhuff Tarkin. Pryce then double-crossed Ghadi by exposing Higher Skies' activities and Ghadi's attempted profiteering to Tarkin himself. In addition to granting Pryce immunity, Tarkin agreed to promote her to [[Governor]] of Lothal and to promote Thrawn's friend Vanto to [[Lieutenant Commander]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nFollowing Pryce's deal with Tarkin, Colonel Yularen and several ISB agents arrested members of Higher Skies and Yinchom Dojo including Juahir and the group's leader Driller MarDapp. Yularen personally arrested Juahir after one of the martial arts instructors' students, the bodyguard [[Kaniki]], tried to assassinate Senator [[Evidorn]]; after being informed about the \"evils\" of the Empire by Madras. When Juahir pleaded for Pryce's help, Pryce instructed her former friend to cooperate fully with Yularen in return for being spared the death penalty. However, Pryce convinced Yularen to spare H'sishi since there was no evidence of any wrongdoing on her part.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n=====The Batonn insurgency=====\n[[File:Batonn-Commanders.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Colonel Yularen attending the meeting called by Fleet Admiral Donassius]]\nIn 2 BBY, Colonel Yularen along with Admiral Thrawn and Commander Vanto attended a high-level meeting of Imperial admirals and governors chaired by [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Jok Donassius]] to discuss the [[Batonn insurgency]]. Nightswan's insurgents had taken the [[Scrim Island Imperial garrison|Imperial garrison]] on [[Scrim Island]] hostage. Thrawn was assigned to deal with the insurgents but insisted on studying the battle longer. Yularen sided with Thrawn and pointed out that the insurgents had disabled the base's [[cathtron tube]]s. An impatient Fleet Admiral Donassius then reassigned Scrim Island to Admiral Durril.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nFollowing the failure of Admiral Durril, Thrawn's [[Ninety-Sixth Task Force]] successfully defeated the Scrim Island insurgents and forced their surrender. However, several of the insurgents managed to flee to the [[Creekpath Mining and Refining complex]] where they holed themselves up. The [[Siege of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex|siege]] of Creekpath was complicated by the presence of Governor Pryce's parents [[Talmoor Pryce|Talmoor]] and [[Elainye Pryce]], who worked at the mine. Pryce managed to convince Colonel Yularen to allow her to accompany Agent [[Gudry]] on an undercover mission to disable the insurgents' deflector shield generator. Colonel Yularen briefed Thrawn about the plan and the Admiral provided the undercover agents with comms and data collectors.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nTo ensure coordination between the Navy and the ISB, Yularen agreed to correspond with Commander Vanto on frequencies and passcodes. After briefing Vanto, Yularen asked the Commander about the unusual position of Thrawn's [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Chimaera]]'' and the rest of the task force including the disabled [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|light cruisers]]. Despite the vulnerable position of the ships, Vanto urged Yularen to have faith in Thrawn's tactics. Not fully trusting Thrawn's plan, Yularen asked Vanto to keep an eye on his commanding officer and expressed concern that Thrawn had become obsessed with stopping Nightswan.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===== Carnage at Creekpath=====\nIn secret, Thrawn communicated with Nightswan and the two met at an empty field to discuss a peaceful solution to the siege. Despite their philosophical differences, Thrawn offered to provide Nightswan a means to join the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] to safeguard the galaxy against threats from the [[Unknown Regions]]. Unwillingly to abandon his men to the tender mercies of Governor [[Restos]], Nightswan declined Thrawn's offer but convinced the Admiral to do his best to minimize civilian casualties at Creekpath. Following the meeting, Yularen picked up Thrawn in his [[airspeeder]] and asked Thrawn why he should not shoot him as a traitor.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nIn private, Thrawn reassured Yularen that he was only trying to seek a peaceful outcome to the Creekpath siege. After being assured of Thrawn's loyalty, Yularen questioned him about the placement of the four light cruisers. Thrawn explained that he had positioned them at a distance so that they would be out of range of any surface attack. When Yularen expressed concern that the light cruisers' positions left them vulnerable to attack, Thrawn responded that this was to prevent theft. Not understanding Thrawn's tactics, Yularen chided Thrawn for his lack of political savvy. Yularen also expressed concern about not receiving any contact from Pryce and Gudry.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nUnknown to Yularen, Pryce and Gudry had fallen out. With Gundry reneging on his promise to evacuate Pryce's parents, Pryce had killed him following a struggle. Meanwhile, Colonel Yularen dispatched a special squad to retrieve the two, believing they were in danger. Pryce and her family reached the Imperial lines safely, where they took shelter at [[Major]] [[Talmege]]'s headquarters. Despite the presence of Yularen's special squad and many civilians, Pryce used Gudry's stolen remote to detonate Nightswan's cache of explosives. While this ended the threat of Nightswan's insurgents, many civilians were killed. In space, Thrawn successfully used the four light cruisers as a bait to lure the insurgent fleet into a trap.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Yularen_Thrawn6.png|thumb|right|250px|Yularen reports on the devastation of the Creekpath facility]]\nFollowing the breaking of the Creekpath siege, Yularen expressed outrage at the high civilian death toll and likened the incident to the Clone Wars. While official reports theorized that Gudry had detonated the explosives to prevent his capture, Yularen blamed Pryce indirectly for the bombing; unaware that she was directly responsible of the incident. Yularen's forces also found and identified Nightswan's corpse. Yularen and Vanto then departed so that Pryce could talk with Thrawn in private. Pryce convinced Thrawn to take responsibility for the suppression of the Batonn insurgency in return for securing the command of the [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]. Thrawn reluctantly obliged and was promoted to the rank of [[Grand Admiral]] by the Emperor.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Hunt for Fulcrum====\n{{Quote|I would never have suspected one of my best students was capable of this betrayal.''\"<br />\"''And that is why you and so many others have been deceived.|Yularen and Thrawn, discussing Agent Kallus|Through Imperial Eyes}}\nMuch later, Yularen was invited by Thrawn to help identify a rebel [[spy]] who operated under the codename Fulcrum. As part of the screening process, Yularen questioned several Imperial officers on the [[Sector Command (Galactic Empire)|Sector Command]] staff in the [[Lothal sector]] aboard Thrawn's flagship ''Chimaera'' including Captain [[Brunson]], Commander [[Brom Titus]], [[Lieutenant]] [[Yogar Lyste]], and his former student Agent Kallus. Lyste and Kallus boarded Thrawn's Imperial Star Destroyer with a captured [[bounty hunter]], who turned out to be the rebel [[Ezra Bridger]].<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nDuring a meeting with Kallus and Lyste, Yularen urged his comrades to remain vigilant for any sign of rebel activity. Thrawn also informed the attendees that he was close to locating the [[Phoenix Cell]]'s [[Chopper Base]] on the planet [[Atollon]]. After exiting the meeting, Yularen chatted with Kallus about the identity of Fulcrum. Kallus claimed that the rebel spy was definitely an officer since it was a high level intelligence leak and suggested someone in the [[Communications Division]]. However, Yularen believed that was too obvious and suspected that Fulcrum had their own communication system. Kallus also promised to help his former mentor. During a private meeting with Thrawn and Pryce, Thrawn voiced his suspicion that the spy had attended their interviews. When Colonel Yularen reported that a coded message had been beamed off the ''Chimaera'' following the arrival of Lyste and Kallus' prisoner. Yularen then accompanied Thrawn and Pryce to interrogate the prisoner.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\n[[File:Yularen_and_Thrawn_TIE.png|thumb|left|250px|Yularen with Thrawn aboard the ISD ''Chimaera'']]\nUpon arriving in the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} [[Detention Block B7|detention block]], Yularen and his comrades discovered that the prisoner had been freed. After Yularen found that the records had indicated that someone using Yogar Lyste's [[code cylinder]] was the last person to enter the brig, Yularen came to suspect that Lyste was Fulcrum. After Thrawn narrowly survived an assassination attempt in [[Thrawn's Office|his office]], Yularen was contacted by the Grand Admiral who told him to head towards the [[hangar]] with [[stormtrooper]] reinforcements. Yularen arrived too late to apprehend the rebels but accepted Kallus' account that Lyste was the rebel spy Fulcrum. Despite Lyste's protests, Yularen ordered his stormtroopers to lead the Lieutenant away.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nIn public, Yularen regarded Lyste's code cylinder as proof of the officer's guilt. After Kallus and Pryce had exited Thrawn's office, Yularen privately confided his doubts about Lyste's guilt to the Grand Admiral. Thrawn agreed and then presented Yularen with Ezra's helmet, which was inscribed with an image of a [[loth-cat]]. When Yularen asked Thrawn why Kallus had withheld Ezra's identity, Thrawn concluded that Kallus was indeed Fulcrum and had framed Lyste to cover his tracks. Yularen expressed shock that one of his former pupils was a traitor, which prompted Thrawn to remark that Yularen had allowed his fondness for his former pupil to deceive him. With Fulcrum \"officially\" captured, Thrawn decided to allow Kallus to continue operating in order to lure the rebels out of hiding.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\n====Liberation of Lothal====\n{{Quote|This is ISB Colonel Yularen. I am executing override code Base Gamma Zero.''\"<br />\"''Imperial security? I was unaware ISB was involved.''\"<br />\"''That is the point of this exercise.''\"<br />\"''Then, uh, this is a drill?''\"<br />\"''Is it? And do you always question the orders of a superior officer?''\"<br />\"''Proceeding with Protocol 13 immediately.|Ryder Azadi impersonates Yularen|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}\nDuring the [[Liberation of Lothal]], the former Lothalian Governor [[Ryder Azadi]] imitated Colonel Yularen's voice in order to force a skeptical Imperial office to comply with a faux [[Protocol 13]] order. Due to Yularen's prestige within the Empire, this ploy worked. As a result, the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal was trapped aboard the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Dome]], a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. The destruction of the garrison and the disappearance of Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet ended Imperial rule on Lothal.<ref name=\"FRAF\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\n====Galactic Civil War and death====\n{{Quote|The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.

He remained quiet throughout the meeting, even when Grand Moff Tarkin announced that the Emperor had [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate|dissolved]] the Imperial Senate.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nAlong with another intelligence officer, he later passed by makeshift rebels [[Han Solo]], [[Luke Skywalker]], and [[Chewbacca]], the former two disguised as stormtroopers in an attempt to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue]] the imprisoned [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Yularen remained onboard the battle station during the [[Battle of Yavin]], where he perished along with thousands of other Imperials when it was destroyed.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I mean&hellip;think about who we lost.

That their loyalty is up for sale to begin with should tell you all you need to know about this scum.|Wullf Yularen|Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious}}\nEven by the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Wullf Yularen was regarded by his peers as a crisp, efficient veteran naval officer. Despite his disagreements with the brash and reckless General Skywalker, he held a sacred respect for the chain of command, a trait which made him assist his Jedi General in any way he could.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\n[[File:Colonel_Yularen_TCGIE.png|thumb|left|250px|Colonel Yularen was a highly skilled and level-headed investigator.]]\nColonel Yularen respected the Chiss Imperial Navy officer Thrawn's creativity and ingenious tactics enough to consider him worthy of joining the Imperial Security Bureau. Knowing that Thrawn was an outsider in a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] Imperial Military, Yularen went out of his way to cultivate civilian allies for the alien officer. Still, Yularen was disturbed by Thrawn's unorthodox tactics and willingness to negotiate with the enemy. While Yularen recognized that Thrawn cared about avoiding excessive civilian casualties, he warned Thrawn that his attempt to negotiate with Nightswan could be misconstrued as treason. As a member of the ISB, Yularen actively led Imperial counterinsurgency efforts against undercover insurgents. As a veteran of the Clone Wars, Yularen was horrified by the high civilian death toll during the siege of Creekpath mine, which brought back dark memories of that conflict.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nYularen took pride in the achievements of one of his former pupils Agent Kallus, a promising Imperial Security Bureau Agent. Yularen's investigative skills led Thrawn to enlist his help in exposing the rebel spy Fulcrum. Yularen's trust and respect in Kallus led him to overlook the ISB agent as a suspect. Kallus manipulated Yularen's trust by fabricating evidence which implicated another officer Lieutenant [[Yogar Lyste]]. While Yularen privately doubted that Lyste was Fulcrum, he was initially convinced by the presence of Lyste's cylinder code. Yularen was shocked that Kallus could become a traitor to the Empire.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWullf Yularen first appeared as an unnamed background character in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], whom the fan website [http://www.aveleyman.com/ Aveleyman] claims was portrayed by [[Robert Clarke]],<ref name=\"Aveleyman\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.aveleyman.com/ActorCredit.aspx?ActorID=103472|title=Robert Clarke|work=Aveleyman.com|archivedate=20181105110232}}</ref> and he was given the name Wullf Yularen by the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] card game [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|''Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game]]. Yularen would later be adopted by the [[2008]] [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] as a recurring character. In that film, the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|subsequent television series of the same name]], and the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' television series; he was voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. Yularen's backstory and subsequent rise to the position of an Imperial Security Bureau Colonel was fleshed out in several [[canon]] novels including [[James Luceno]]'s [[2014]] novel [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']], [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[2017]] novel [[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]. Kane later reprised his role as Colonel Yularen in the ''Star Wars Rebels'' episode \"[[Through Imperial Eyes]],\" which premiered on [[February 25]], 2017.{{Fact}}\n\nIn the commentary for ''The Clone Wars'' movie, the movies' creators were under the assumption that Yularen had been a [[Grand Admiral]] during the time of Episode IV, given his white uniform. As such, they opted to portray Yularen as an admiral, as a means of showing him in the process of rising through the ranks.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] DVD commentary</ref>\n\nIn the [[StarWars.com]] [[Encyclopedia (StarWars.com)|Encyclopedia]] and the [[Databank (original)|Databank]], Yularen's first name was spelled \"Wulff,\" rather than Wullf as spelled in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Customizable Card Game, thus making the new spelling part of the ''Star Wars'' canon. However, ''Tarkin'' and ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]'', a [[2015]] sourcebook published by [[Dorling Kindersley]], use the original ''Star Wars'' Legends spelling of his name. This issue was later remedied, with Yularen's [[Databank (website)|Databank]] page being updated with the \"Wullf\" spelling. In the end credits of several first ''The Clone Wars'' episodes, his last name was misspelled as \"Yularan.\"{{Fact}}\n\nThe character's voice actor Tom Kane compared Yularen in Imperial times to General [[Wikipedia:Erwin Rommel|Erwin Rommel]], a German commander in [[Wikipedia:World War II|World War II]]. Rommel's opposite number on the battlefield, Lieutenant-General [[Wikipedia:Bernard Montgomery|Bernard Montgomery]], respected the German commander and said that even though Rommel wore the [[Wikipedia:Nazi Germany|Nazi]] uniform, he wasn't a Nazi. Kane believed that Yularen, a strict military officer, was simply following orders when the Republic transitioned into the Empire.{{Fact}}\n\nTimothy Zahn, author of the [[Thrawn trilogy]] in Star Wars Legends, stated that he would like to write a novel featuring Yularen, as he is his favorite background ''Star Wars'' character.<ref name=\"Zahn Interview\">{{Youtube|GYUk_LmQKz4|Timothy Zahn
