Juro had Zhima produce eight [[lightsaber]]s for him, as he intended to try and restart the [[Jedi Order]], but they were discovered by [[Sith]] [[Jedi hunter]]s. The hunters captured Zhima and took him to a distant [[star system]] but not before he managed to get the sabers to Kara, who brought them to Juro's [[Jedi]] recruits. After Kara helped Juro defeat the recruits that were disguised Sith, Juro promised that he would help save her [[Parent|father]].\n\n==Biography==\n===A legendary sabersmith===\n{{Quote|I kept my promise, and I actually finished them on time.|Lah Zhima|The Ninth Jedi}}\n[[File:LahZhimaLightsaber.png|thumb|right|300px|Lah Zhika in his workspace with Lah Kara]]\nLah Zhima<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" /> was a legendary<ref name=\"Heroes\">{{SW|url=news/inside-star-wars-visions-meet-the-heroes|text=Inside ''Star Wars: Visions'': Meet the Heroes}}</ref> [[sabersmith]] who lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] [[Hy Izlan]], where [[Gender|he]] used [[kyber crystal]]s to build [[lightsaber]]s for the [[margrave]], [[Juro]]. Zhima's daughter, [[Lah Kara]], lived with him on the planet. Zhima build eight lightsabers for the margrave and finished them on [[time]] as he promised, tempering each [[crystal]] so that the [[color]] and length would be controlled by which [[Jedi]] wielded it. Zhima explained this to Kara following the eighth saber being completed, noticing her talent and teaching her about [[the Force]].<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\nHowever, that [[Standard day|day]], a [[starship]] of Jedi hunters arrived, which prompted Zhima to give all of the lightsabers to Kara so that she could deliver them to the [[Aerial Temple]] that [[orbit]]ed the planet; Juro had recruited Jedi candidates to the temple in the hopes of restoring the [[Jedi Order]], which was why he required the lightsabers. Kara was surprised that her [[Parent|father]] was not going to deliver them, but he claimed that he would be looking after the guests, despite the fact that they were not actually his guests. He embraced her, acting as though he would not see his daughter again&mdash;again surprising her. Kara then ran away, just as two hunters burst through the door and asked of his identitity, which he confirmed. They then accused him of manufacturing illegal lightsabers, which he avoided denying.<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\nWhen Zhima was told that he would be taken away, he tried to refuse. He then checked the window to make sure that Kara was far enough away<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" /> and deflected the hunters' shots into his oven,<ref name=\"epguide\">{{SW|url=series/star-wars-visions/episode-guide-the-ninth-jedi|text=''Star Wars: Visions'' {{!}} \"The Ninth Jedi\" Episode Guide}}</ref> exploding his building along with the hunters. The explosion was too small, however, and all three individuals inside survived. Kara also noticed and turned around to find her father being dragged on the ground by the hunters. He begged her to run once he saw her, which she did, escaping on a [[speeder]] and being chased by one of the hunters. The remaining hunter took away Zhima.<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n===Following capture===\n{{Quote|I'm the daughter of the sabersmith Lah Zhima.|Kara|The Ninth Jedi}}\n[[File:ZhimaCaptured.png|thumb|left|300px|Zhima was captured and taken away.]]\nKara mentioned her father when meeting the Jedi recruits of the Aerial Temple, which intrigued them, as they were anticipating the lightsabers. Once Kara revealed them, they accepted the sabers eagerly. However, most of the recruits were [[Sith]], not Jedi, their lightsabers turning red as an indication.<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\nDuring the subsequent [[lightsaber duel]], one of the Sith told Kara that Lah Zhima had been taken to a [[star system]] far away and that she would never see him again. She also informed Kara that any rescue attempts would be unsuccessful. Despite the Sith's number, Juro, Kara, and the only two recruits who were indeed Jedi, [[Ethan]] and [[Homen]], were able to win the duel. Juro explained to Kara that he had only recently learned that Sith were sent in place of several Jedi, which was how they had learned of Zhima's sabersmith abilities. He apologized for not being able to help when he was taken but promised that he would help Kara save him.<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You do have some natural talent with a lightsaber, Kara, but your connection will grow in time with proper training.|Lah Zhima|The Ninth Jedi}}\nZhima had a loving relationship with his daughter; she meant everything to him, and he meant everything to her.<ref name=\"Heroes\" /> He was willing to sacrifice himself for her, begging her to run while he was captured.
