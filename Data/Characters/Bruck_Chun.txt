I'm not afraid to fight ''him'' without his blindfold.|attr=Bruck Chun and Obi-Wan Kenobi spar in the presence of Yoda.|src=Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force}}\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] male with ice-blue eyes and white hair, Bruck Chun, the brother of [[Kad Chun]], was born to [[Vox Chun]] of [[Telos IV]] in [[57 BBY/Legends|57 BBY]].<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions\">''[[Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions]]''</ref> Given to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] for [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Initiate]] Chun was enrolled in the [[Jedi academy|academy]] at the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]]. Befriending fellow Initiate [[Aalto]], Chun and his friend often taunted their peer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom they called \"Oafy-Wan\" after Kenobi had lost his balance on one occasion, colliding with Chun.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force\" /> He also attempted to impress the attractive Initiate, [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]], many times, but to no avail; he eventually moved on.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\nAround [[45 BBY/Legends|45 BBY]] and [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]], Chun had secretly learned from [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Xanatos]], a business partner of Chun's father and fellow Telosian,<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" /><ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions\" /> that his father Vox was the [[Treasurer of Telos]].<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" /><ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning\">''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning]]''</ref> He bragged about it at one time to Siri Tachi, something the girl would later bring up during a [[Incident at the Jedi Temple|future investigation]].<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\nAs both Chun and Kenobi reached their final years at the academy, both vied for the attention of a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who would select them as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]. During an unsupervised sparring session, Chun deliberately started to antagonize Kenobi and both students walked away with minor bruises. Chun, in an attempt to get Kenobi in trouble with academy [[Jedi instructor|instructors]], went to the [[Halls of Healing]] to report an attack by Kenobi and receive treatment for his wounds. Instead of disciplining Kenobi as Chun had hoped, [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] set up a duel between the two Initiates to demonstrate their skills for visiting Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]]. Completing the duel fairly, Master Jinn did not select either of the Initiates, much to Chun's chagrin. By this time, Chun was no longer using one of the Temple's [[Training lightsaber/Legends|training lightsabers]]; instead, he wielded a red-bladed weapon available to senior Initiates.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force\" />\n\nIn the following months, Kenobi had been selected by Master Jinn after all, but the Master-apprentice bond was broken after the disastrous [[Mission to Melida/Daan|mission]] to [[Melida/Daan]]. There, Padawan Kenobi had forsworn his oath to the Order and joined a militant group called [[the Young]] and fought in the [[Melida/Daan Civil War]]. Returning to the Temple without his Padawan, Master Jinn could not be bothered by Initiate Chun's attempts to get him to accept him as his next student.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path\">''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path]]''</ref>\n\n===Betraying the Order===\n{{Quote|No one chose me as Padawan!\"<br>\"Then you were not ready.\"<br />\"I was ready! More ready than you, Obi-Wan. You're the one who disgraced the order. [...] I was always better than you. Now, I am even stronger.|A fallen Chun expresses his bitterness toward Kenobi and the Jedi Order.|Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple}}\n[[File:Jedi_Apprentice.jpg|thumb|220px|Chun duels Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Room of a Thousand Fountains.]]\nCrestfallen with Master Jinn's constant refusal to take him on as an apprentice, Chun was easy prey to the temptations offered by Xanatos. Corrupted by Xanatos, Chun assisted the Dark Jedi as Xanatos infiltrated the Temple and began wreaking havoc. A pawn of the manipulative former Jedi,<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" /> Chun stole many artifacts from within the Temple, including the precious [[Healing Crystals of Fire]]. He was secretly caught in the act by Jinn and Master [[Tahl]] while he was covering up some of the stolen items from the Temple's [[Jedi Temple Lake Level|Lake Level]]. Jinn tried to follow him, but Tahl's navigation droid [[2JTJ]] accidentally alerted Chun of the Jedi's presence. He was forced to disappear after that.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path\" /> Keeping close to the masters, Chun transmitted recordings of conversations with the Jedi via a transmitter installed secretly in his lightsaber hilt.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\nWhen Xanatos had finally been found out, he kidnapped Initiate [[Bant Eerin/Legends|Bant Eerin]] and chained her underwater in the [[Room of a Thousand Fountains/Legends|Room of a Thousand Fountains]]. While Master Jinn attempted to halt Xanatos stealing the Temple's supply of valuable [[Crystalline vertex/Legends|vertex]], the Dark Jedi ordered Chun to kill Initiate Eerin immediately. Kenobi chased Chun to the Room of a Thousand Fountains and engaged his opponent in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]]. They made their way up the slippery slope of the chamber's central waterfall. As Kenobi struggled to break away from Chun in order to rescue Initiate Eerin, who was chained to the bottom of the room's lake, Chun lost his footing and toppled over the edge of the waterfall. Chun tried his best to hold on, but couldn't hold on for long, though Kenobi apologized for everything and attempted to save his life, which surprised Chun. Chun ignored him, and preferred to die for everything he had done, and saying that he wasn't truly a strong apprentice to begin with. Kenobi didn't want him to die and tried to reach him, but it was far too late for the young Initiate. Chun couldn't hold on and plummeted to the rocks below, breaking his neck.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|You are responsible for Bruck's death. Not Obi-Wan. You corrupted the boy, turning him to the dark side. He followed you blindly.|Qui-Gon Jinn to Xanatos|Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning}}\nFollowing his death, Chun's father initiated an [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's Senate hearing|investigation]] into his son's death. Employing [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Sano Sauro]] as prosecutor, Initiate Kenobi was implicated in the death of his peer. Appearing before the Senate's Inquiry committee, Kenobi was rescued from prosecution by Master Jinn. Entering Chun's recovered lightsaber into evidence, Jinn played the recording of Chun's final words for the committee: the evidence proved Kenobi innocent, although it would be many years before Chun's brother Kad would forgive Kenobi and before Kenobi could forgive himself.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Expandsect}}\n{{Quote|Yet Bruck was angry once.\"<br>\"Yoda says he's made great improvements.

Even Yoda and [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] could see Chun's deceptive nature.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force\" /> He also valued his dignity greatly, and was known to hold grudges. This was especially evident when Obi-Wan tripped him in the halls of the Jedi Temple accidentally, and he soon found an enemy in the boy. Chun was also impatient and quick to anger. Yoda appeared to have helped him improve on his faults.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path\" /> Yet he was very eager to become Qui-Gon Jinn's Padawan, just as Kenobi was.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force\" /><ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path\" /> Siri Tachi also depicted him as a showoff and a \"bore.\"<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\nWhen Chun felt his hopes of becoming a Padawan dashed, Xanatos preyed upon his feelings. Turning the Initiate to the dark side, he taught him cunning and let him feed on his hatred for Obi-Wan Kenobi.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Expandsect}}\n{{Quote|I've learned well, haven't I? [[Xanatos]] showed me what true power is. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] will regret that they held me back!\"<br />\"They never held you back.|Chun displays his skill in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] to Obi-Wan Kenobi.|Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple}}\nDuring his sparring duels with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, respectively, Chun did acrobatic leaps toward his opponents, suggesting that his style may have been [[Form IV/Legends|Ataru]].<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force\" /><ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path\" /> In fact, he tried to mimic the moves of Siri Tachi's fighting style during training exercises.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" /> At age 11, possibly younger, Chun could also see to duel wearing a blindfold, and wore one while fighting Obi-Wan. However, Obi-Wan defeated Chun in this match, greatly angering the boy.\n\nAfter having been converted to the dark side, Chun was believed to have been taught [[Force stealth]] by Xanatos.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBruck Chun was created by the author [[Dave Wolverton]] for the first young readers novel ''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force]]'' in the [[Jedi Apprentice]] series. He was used later by fellow author [[Jude Watson]] who wrote the rest of the series and he would appear in the novel [[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path|''The Uncertain Path'']] before his death in [[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple|''The Captive Temple'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path]]''\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple]]''\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions]]'' {{C|Voice recording}}\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Master of Disguise]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080423/index.html|text=''Precipice''|int=Precipice|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-precipice.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|54|Bookshelf}}\n*{{FFCite|10|KEN3, ''Obi-Wan Kenobi''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' {{1stp}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bruck Chun#legends\n|es=Bruck Chun\n|fr=Bruck Chun\n|pl=Bruck Chun\n|ru=\u0411\u0440\u0443\u043a \u0427\u0430\u043d\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chun, Bruck}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
