An [[Alcohol/Legends|alcoholic]], Firdaaz spent a lot of his [[Time/Legends|time]] drunk, but he had a wealth of knowledge and survival skills. In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Firdaaz found himself on [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]], the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of the [[Kathol sector]], and subsequently signed onto the crew of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'', which had been assigned to [[DarkStryder Campaign|track down]] the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kentor Sarne]]. Sarne had ruled Kal'Shebbol until the New Republic [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberated]] the planet but had fled during the battle, taking the majority of his [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] with him. Unlike many other members of the crew, Firdaaz had no personal stake in the mission, and he sought no vengeance against Sarne himself&mdash;he simply wanted to visit as many planets as possible before he [[Death/Legends|died]]. Firdaaz served on the ''FarStar'' until the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] reached the planet known as [[Demonsgate]] on the edge of the [[Kathol Rift/Legends|Kathol Rift]], a volatile area of [[Realspace/Legends|space]] filled with dense [[Nebula/Legends|gas clouds]] and [[lightstorm]]s that disrupted [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]], navigational instruments, and communications. He volunteered to remain on the planet to maintain the communications link known as the [[Lifeline Project]], which was the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette's]] only means of staying in contact with New Republic forces based on Kal'Shebbol.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[Reproduction/Legends|Born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Firdaaz was a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] for most of his life, and he explored countless planets. Firdaaz was also an [[Alcohol/Legends|alcoholic]], and he often spent much of his [[Time/Legends|time]] in a drunken stupor. Sometime during the course of his life, he acquired the nickname \"Gammer.\"<ref name=\"tdc\" /> In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the elderly Firdaaz was on the planet [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]], the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of the [[Kathol sector]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], when it was [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberated]] by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"tsb\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref>\n\n===Service aboard the ''FarStar''===\nFirdaaz learned about the New Republic's [[DarkStryder Campaign|mission]] to track down [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kentor Sarne]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] who had ruled Kal'Shebbol and the Kathol sector. Sarne had fled the planet with the majority of his [[Moff Sarne's forces|forces]], and the New Republic was sending a single [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the modified [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'', after him. However, due to manpower shortages, the New Republic could not afford to crew the vessel with entirely New Republic personnel, so they took to recruiting from amongst the population of Kal'Shebbol itself. Firdaaz, possessed by a deep desire to see as much of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] as he could before he [[Death/Legends|died]], signed onto the crew as a scout, believing that his skills would be an asset to the mission. Unlike many of his new crewmates, Firdaaz had no personal issues against the Moff to settle. However, his alcoholism affected his shipboard duties, as he was often drunk. He found common ground with several other members of the crew who had the same problem, and they often hid in isolated corners of the ship to indulge themselves whenever a bottle of alcohol was found or [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggled]] aboard.<ref name=\"tdc\" />\n\nSeveral [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] into the ''FarStar''{{'s}} voyage, the ship stopped off at the planet [[Binaros]] to replenish its food supplies after crossing the [[Marcol Void]], an empty expanse of [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. The landing party inadvertently brought [[feeder plant]] spores back aboard, and several settled in the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette's]] lower forward hold. As the [[Plant/Legends|plant]] began to grow, mobile feeders were sent out to bring the plant the nutrients and [[Water/Legends|water]] it required. Firdaaz, sleeping in one of the ship's alcoves after a drinking session, was awakened by several of the small plant creatures poking at him. Frightened, he ran to the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] and relayed his experience to [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Kaiya Adrimetrum]], ranting and raving, and he demanded that the captain do something about the \"beasties\" loose on the ship. Members of the crew investigated the alcove but found no evidence of the creature's existence, and it was dismissed because Firdaaz was drunk at the time. The crew later found that out that Firdaaz had been correct, and they were forced to battle the plant after it entered a stage in its life-cycle where it developed a need for the [[Nitrogen/Legends|nitrogen]] found in the [[Blood/Legends|blood]] of living beings. [[Varel DeVay]], a [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] working in the ship's hydroponic bays, managed to create a gaseous [[Poison/Legends|poison]] that killed the plant.<ref name=\"pf\">{{DarkStryder|Plant Food|The Kathol Outback}}</ref>\n\n[[Standard month/Legends|Months]] after leaving Kal'Shebbol, the ''FarStar'' passed through a volatile [[Nebula/Legends|gas cloud]] known as the [[Kathol Rift/Legends|Kathol Rift]]. Due to the severe [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]] and [[Lightstorm|energy storms]] present in the Rift, long-range communications with New Republic assets stationed at Kal'Shebbol were impossible. [[Brophar Tofarain]] and [[Lofryyhn]], the ''FarStar''{{'s}} chief [[Technician/Legends|mechanics]], devised a solution to the communications problem. Dubbed the [[Lifeline Project]], six [[Probe droid/Legends|probe droids]] were to be stationed at predetermined points in the Rift to act as a communications relay. The planet [[Demonsgate]] at the edge of the Rift was chosen as the end point for the project, and Firdaaz volunteered to remain on the planet to maintain a semi-permanent facility for the link for as long as the ''FarStar'' needed it. Although she was initially skeptical about leaving the scout behind, Captain Adrimetrum agreed to his request. The maintenance of the Lifeline Project proved crucial to the ''FarStar''{{'s}} mission, as it allowed the [[Bothan Combat Response Element]], which had been trailing the ship, to reinforce the corvette during the [[Battle of Kathol System|Battle of Kathol]] wherein the New Republic forces claimed victory over Moff Sarne.<ref name=\"s\">{{DarkStryder|Showdown (RPG adventure)|The Kathol Rift}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n\"Gammer\" Firdaaz had dark skin, [[white]] hair, and a mustache. He always believed that he knew what was best in any given situation, and he made his feelings on all matters perfectly clear. He was always quick to berate others if they tried something their own way and it did not work. Although not part of the ''FarStar''{{'s}} command crew, Firdaaz acted as though he was, and he had to be told otherwise on several occasions. Firdaaz was an alcoholic, and he was often drunk. He made sure he was never very far from a bottle of [[Socorran]] [[raava]]. When Firdaaz was not drunk, he was grumpy and unwilling to follow orders and often needed incentives to perform his duties.<ref name=\"tdc\" />\n\nAn experienced scout, Firdaaz had an extensive knowledge of survival skills and was an experienced tracker, abilities that helped him to stay alive on the hostile planets he explored. Only truly happy when he had the solid ground of a new world under his feet and he was allowed to explore, Firdaaz quickly grew tired of shipboard life during the ''FarStar''{{'s}} mission and relished the opportunity to disembark and scout a new planet. To assist him in his scouting duties, he carried a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], a [[Knife/Legends|knife]], a [[Breath mask/Legends|breath mask]], [[Macrobinoculars/Legends|macrobinoculars]], a [[Medpac/Legends|medpac]], and protective [[Goggles/Legends|goggles]].<ref name=\"tdc\" />\n\nFirdaaz also had a knowledge of [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Species/Legends|species]] and [[Star system/Legends|planetary systems]], and could use a personal blaster or ones mounted to vehicles. He also had some training in [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee combat]]. He was able to [[Astrogation/Legends|plot courses]] through [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], operate and repair [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles, and ride animals. He was also trained in [[Medic/Legends|first aid]].<ref name=\"tdc\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\"Gammer\" Firdaaz was created for ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' by [[West End Games]] for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''. He was a member of the support crew and appeared only sporadically throughout the subsequent supplements ''[[The Kathol Outback]]'' and ''[[The Kathol Rift]]''. While players had the freedom to develop Firdaaz as they saw fit, ''The DarkStryder Campaign'' stated that he was to remain alive as he would be developed in later supplements.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Plant Food|The Kathol Outback}} {{1st}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Showdown (RPG adventure)|The Kathol Rift}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Kathol Outback]]''\n*''[[The Kathol Rift]]''\n*''[[The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:FarStar crewmembers and personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Socorrans]]"}}}]}}}}
