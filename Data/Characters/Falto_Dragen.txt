He and his troops killed the Rebel [[Idu Taanfaar]] and captured [[Nuuk Kuur]], but failed to capture [[Cala Worner]], a recruiter for the Alliance. Cala and a group of previously uncommitted bystanders rescued Nuuk, beginning what would become a personal vendetta for the officer. Later the same year, simultaneously with the arrival of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]], he and his unit were transferred to [[Daroon]], where he failed to arrest [[Alku Vordu]], a [[Senator/Legends|senator]] sympathetic to the Rebellion. Despite the destruction of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], Dragen remained loyal to the Empire.\n\nHe did, however, visit [[the Graveyard]] to leave personal effects in memory of his family. Imperial [[storm commando]]s observed him and confirmed his reliability. He participated in the occupation of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragen, Falto}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Stormtrooper officers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
