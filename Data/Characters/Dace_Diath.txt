But we gave as good as we got.|Dace Diath|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith}}\n'''Dace Diath''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] and one of many [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] who trained under [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Vodo-Siosk Baas]]. He spent the majority of his early life on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] being taught his initial [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] by his father, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master [[Sidrona Diath]]. Upon completion of the training, he traveled to [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] and became an apprentice to Master Vodo. He would eventually be one of the Jedi sent as reinforcements to help [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] during the [[Freedon Nadd Uprising]] on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]. He later participated in the [[Conclave at Deneba|Convocation]] at [[Mount Meru (Deneba)|Mount Meru]] on [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]] and fought against the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].\n\nHe was an experienced and talented [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], and while on Onderon learned to fly one of the [[Beast Riders|Beast Rider's]] [[Drexl|war beasts]]. Dace Diath, along with fellow Jedi [[Qrrrl Toq]] and [[Shoaneb Culu]], was [[Death/Legends|killed]] when [[Aleema Keto]] used [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] powers to [[Supernova/Legends|destroy]] a [[Star/Legends|star]] in the [[Cron Cluster/Legends|Cron Cluster]]. He was an ancestor of Jedi Master [[Nico Diath]] and [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Tae Diath]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early training===\n{{Quote|A Jedi who tries with all of his being never fails. It is the Jedi who gives up that fails&mdash;fails not only himself, but the Force as well.|A holocron gatekeeper, to Dace Diath as a young child|Tales of the Jedi Companion}}\n[[File:Young_Dace.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A young Dace Diath]]\nDace Diath was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] the son of the famous [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Sidrona Diath]]<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" /> at some point before [[4017 BBY]],<ref name=\"Warfare\" /> and Dace grew up on the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. The remoteness of Tatooine permitted Sidrona to begin [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] his son in the ways of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], eventually leading Dace to the place where he could achieve a deep understanding of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. His father's training, coupled with the isolated environment he found himself in, allowed Dace to touch the Force and let it flow through him unhindered. However, even though he was able to open himself up to the Force, and pushed himself to be the best student he could, Dace found that he was still learning slowly. That led Dace to consider abandoning his Jedi training, not because he disliked the rigid lifestyle he was forced to live, but mainly because he did not want to disappoint his father. If he did not try, he reasoned, then he could not fail.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nHis father recognized these [[Time/Legends|times]] of self-doubt in his son and did all he could to strengthen Dace's confidence in himself and his faith in the Jedi way. During one of these times, Sidrona realized that it was usually those Jedi who had worked the hardest and most diligently in their studies of the Force, that became the most capable and gifted teachers; they could better understand the hardships their students faced, and therefore help guide them to a resolution. Sidrona constantly reminded his son of that, and therefore convinced Dace that he was not alone in his difficulties, and that he might one day be able to assume the mantle of a Jedi Master.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\n===Self-doubt and discovery===\nSidrona Diath routinely trained Dace in the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]], on both the physical and mental sides of the Force. After one especially frustrating day of training in the Wastes, Dace lost all faith in his abilities. As in previous times, Dace went to his father for support, but that time Sidrona did not offer any words of comfort. Instead, he told Dace that he needed now to learn to rely on the Force unconditionally and to look inward to discover his destiny rather than rely on outside support. Dace, fairly surprised and rather upset at his father's words, wandered away from his home and into the dying light of dusk&mdash;trying to focus his thoughts on the Force and his problem.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nHe wandered aimlessly throughout the surrounding landscape, the long minutes spanning into even longer [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]], fighting with the confusion and inner turmoil that had taken over his [[Brain/Legends|mind]]. He drifted until he was half-frozen, and found himself on the edge of the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]]. Then, he saw through the swirling mists of confusion in his mind, and began to recall things from the depths of his memories. The one memory that rushed to the forefront was when his father had taken him as a young [[Youngling/Legends|child]] to [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] to visit the [[Great Jedi Library/Legends|Great Jedi Library]]. While there, he had inspected a Jedi [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]], and the [[gatekeeper]] had spoken to the young Dace Diath. Dace recalled that the gatekeeper had spoken to him of how a Jedi who tries and does not give up, will never fail&mdash;and that a Jedi who does give up not only fails himself, but also the Force.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nPondering on what the gatekeeper had told him, Diath finally realized that it was his own way of thinking that had resulted in all his difficulties. He concluded that if he could just practice, train, and learn under his father without all these negative personal feelings about his progress, then he would not be hampered any longer, and he would therefore succeed. On his way back to his father's home, he likewise came to the understanding that his father had declined him help, because he would never accept these revelations if someone else had presented him with them; he had to illuminate and discover his own path, and believe in it without question. Otherwise, if he never accepted his own destiny fully, then he would never overcome his own self-doubt.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nDace eventually returned to his father, and continued training under Sidrona's tutelage for a further two [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. At the end of that time, Dace felt that he was ready to leave his father to travel to Ossus and continue his training at the Jedi training center there. Upon arrival on Ossus, he became the student of Jedi Master [[Vodo-Siosk Baas]].<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\n===Road to Knighthood===\n{{Quote|Is this where the flux aperture goes, Master Vodo?|Dace Diath|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1}}\n[[File:Dace_Diath_creating_a_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dace constructing a lightsaber under the guidance of Vodo-Siosk Baas.]]\nDace Diath approached his training on Ossus much the same way as he handled his studies under his father; he studied diligently at the Great Jedi [[Library/Legends|Library]]; pushed himself when learning new levels of the Force; and continued to improve upon how he allowed the Force to flow through him. All through the new training regimes on Ossus under Master Vodo, Diath adhered to the lessons he learned in the Dune Sea on Tatooine, mastering his self-doubt and consequently excelling in his Jedi training.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" /> He impressed Master Vodo so much that when Vodo departed Ossus for [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], he asked Diath to accompany him and continue to train under him. On Dantooine, Diath continued his Jedi training under Master Vodo, and was later joined by fellow apprentices [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], and the [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathars]] [[Sylvar]] and [[Crado]].<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\nFollowing his training, Diath joined [[Nomi Sunrider]], [[Shoaneb Culu]], [[Qrrrl Toq]], and [[Kith Kark]] in answering [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma's]] call for reinforcements against the [[Naddist]]s during the [[Freedon Nadd Uprising]].<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\n===The Freedon Nadd Uprising===\n{{Quote|I'm right behind you, Kith!|Dace Diath, during the Freedon Nadd Uprising|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Freedon Nadd Uprising}}\n[[File:Dace_in_the_Naddist_Revolt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dace and Ulic Qel-Droma during the Freedon Nadd Uprising]]\nFollowing the events which took place on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] that saw the capture of Jedi Master [[Arca Jeth]], Ulic Qel-Droma sent a request to Ossus for additional Jedi support in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. In response to that, the entire Jedi assembly gathered at Ossus volunteered for the mission, however only five Jedi Knights were chosen&mdash;Dace Diath being one of them.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising\" />\n\nThe [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] also responded to Ulic's request for help and sent a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of [[Warship/Legends|warships]] which laid siege to the walled [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] on Onderon. Upon arrival, the Jedi [[Cruiser/Legends|cruisers]] from Ossus circled the land outside the walled city in search of Qel-Droma and his remaining Jedi. Sensing Qel-Droma in a fortress not far from Iziz, the five Jedi reinforcements rushed to his aid&mdash;Diath and the other Jedi used Force battle-techniques which had been perfected over many centuries, and together they charged the ranks of their numerous enemy. During the attack, Nomi Sunrider commented that an energy field was blocking her Jedi [[Battle meditation]]; likewise, Diath also noticed that something strange was happening. Diath found himself fighting an ancient [[Sith Elite Warbot|Sith War Droid]] that he could feel [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] energy radiating off of.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising\" /> Eventually Diath and the other Jedi reinforcements linked up with Qel-Droma and the remaining Jedi of [[Cay Qel-Droma]], [[Tott Doneeta]], and [[Oss Wilum]]; together they discovered that it was [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]] of Onderon who was creating the dark side energies that they could all sense. With the help of Diath and the other Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma managed to defeat Ommin and break the dark side influence over Onderon. Following Ommin's defeat, the Jedi entombed [[Freedon Nadd]]'s remains on Onderon's beast [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]].<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\n===A gathering darkness===\n====Rise of the Krath====\n{{Quote|How's that possible, Master Arca?|Diath, upon hearing of Sith activity in the Tetan System|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith}}\nShortly after the events of the Naddist Revolt, Master Arca Jeth arrived back on Onderon to advise Diath and the other Jedi there about recent events which revolved around the re-emergence of the Sith in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]]. Master Jeth informed them of the [[Politics/Legends|political]] coup initiated by the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] cult, headed by the Tetans [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal Keto]] and his cousin [[Aleema Keto]]. The Jedi were surprised that these two young Tetans, whom they had discovered were on Onderon during the height of the Naddist Revolt, were now deeply immersed in Sith teachings. Diath, Qrrrl Toq, Oss Wilum, and Shoaneb Culu were ordered by Master Jeth to go to Ossus and warn the Jedi and Republic leaders of the dangers of what they had experienced on Onderon and the gathering darkness in the Empress Teta System.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith\">''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Dace-older.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dace at the time of the Krath conflict]]\nWith the information, the Republic and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] decided to send a combined fleet to the aid of the remaining Tetan worlds that were still resisting the Krath coup. Diath and several other Jedi joined the task force, and the combined fleet arrived in the Empress Teta System just in time to support the last remaining holdouts of resistance on [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]]. However, through the use of ancient [[Sith magic]], the Krath forces&mdash;under the leadership of Satal and Aleema Keto&mdash;used [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] tactics to utterly destroy the Jedi and Republic fleet. Diath was one of the few Jedi who survived the attack.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\nFollowing the Krath victory at Koros Major, Nomi Sunrider, Tott Doneeta, and Cay Qel-Droma attempted to make secret contact with Ulic who had managed to infiltrate the Krath cult. However, by that time, Ulic had begun his slow descent to the dark side&mdash;when Nomi and the others found him, Ulic used dark side energy to push them away from him, threatening that he would kill them. The Jedi realized that something was drastically wrong, and together they retreated back to Ossus. Once back on Ossus, Diath and Cay Qel-Droma were asked to test the new, but still experimental, [[Star Saber XC-01 starfighter|Star Saber Starfighters]]. During the test flights, Dace narrowly escaped death after he lost control of his [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] in the rocky canyons of Ossus. Even though the starfighter exploded upon impact, Dace managed to eject and use the Force to gently lower himself to the ground.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith\" />\n\nSunrider and the other Jedi returned from their mission empty-handed, and it was decided that the Jedi would stage an all-out assault against the Krath to rescue Ulic. Diath, despite his recent trouble with the starfighter, chose another Star Saber for the upcoming attack. However, the rescue did not go to plan, with Ulic shunning Sunrider and Cay and choosing to stay with Aleema and the Krath.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith\" />\n\n===The Sith War===\n{{Quote|Why would anyone want to kill Master Dominus?|Diath, upon finding the corpse of Jedi Master Dominus|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Sith War}}\n[[File:Dace_fighting_on_Coruscant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dace fighting on Coruscant during the Great Sith War.]]\nUlic Qel-Droma led a Krath attack fleet to Republic [[Realspace/Legends|space]] and launched an [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|invasion]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]; it was that invasion which sparked off the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. Diath, along with many other Jedi, fought on Coruscant and helped defend the city planet from the invading Krath forces. Ulic himself led the attack from the ground, but the Krath were beaten back by the combined Republic and Jedi forces. When the Krath forces retreated from Coruscant, Ulic was left facing the gathered might of a group of Jedi, including Diath, led by Nomi Sunrider and Vodo-Siosk Baas. Together, Sunrider and Master Vodo used the [[Wall of light|'Blocking']] technique taught by Jedi Master [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] and temporarily cut Ulic off from the Force. Diath, along with the other Jedi, added his powers to Sunrider's and Master Vodo's to help momentarily imprison Ulic.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" />\n\nFollowing Ulic's disastrous invasion of Coruscant, he was rescued from Republic captivity by Exar Kun and [[Mandalore the Indomitable]].<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" /> He eventually made his way back to lead the Krath forces. Ulic knew that Aleema had betrayed and abandoned him on Coruscant, and his revenge against her was swift: he ordered her to lead an attack on the Republic jump station at [[Kemplex IX]] during which she would set off a [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]]. Ulic knew that the attack would ultimately consume her. Diath, in response to Aleema's attack, organized a Jedi force to respond to the distress signals coming from Kemplex IX.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\n====One with the Force====\n{{Quote|Let the three of us lead the counterattack on Kemplex Nine.

To that assembly of Jedi, Tott Doneeta announced that Kemplex IX was under attack by an ancient Sith [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. To the gathered Jedi, Master [[Thon]] explained his beliefs that the Krath attack on Kemplex IX was a feint, rationalizing that everything Ulic and Kun wanted was right there on Ossus. Upon hearing that, Diath, Shoaneb Culu, and Qrrrl Toq volunteered to give chase to the mysterious Sith ship while the remaining Jedi stayed behind and protected Ossus.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" />\n\nUpon arriving at Kemplex IX, Diath, Shoaneb, and Qrrrl found the entire area completely devoid of life&mdash;except for the Sith ship commanded by Aleema and Crado. Diath led the attack on the ancient ship, but noted when it began to power up its systems.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" /> Little did Diath and the other Jedi know that Aleema had used the ancient weapons on the Sith ship to rip the core from the center of one of the ten [[Star/Legends|stars]] in the [[Cron Cluster/Legends|Cron Cluster]]. The resulting supernova engulfed Dace and the other pursuing Jedi, killing them instantly.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDace Diath was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] with [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and brown skin. He was known to be a hard worker and studious in his studies as a Jedi. As a young apprentice to his father Sidrona Diath, Dace Diath was able to touch the Force unhindered, but struggled with the pace at which he was progressing in his training. He had frequent bouts of self-doubt, and Diath tended to focus on the negative aspects of a situation. However, through his father's guidance and by walking the path of self-discovery, Diath was able to overcome his self-doubt and fully embrace the Jedi destiny that stood before him.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFollowing the completion of his training, Diath became known as a skilled warrior with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and demonstrated his prowess during several campaigns against the Sith. He was among five Jedi chosen for the special assignment of lending aid to Ulic Qel-Droma during the Naddist Revolt.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising\" /> Diath was also present during the Krath invasion of Coruscant, where he fought bravely with his lightsaber against the invading armies. He was also one of many Jedi to combine their powers in creating a wall of light to contain the Sith Lord Ulic-Qel Droma.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" />\n\nDiath was also an experienced and talented [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], having flown several dangerous missions for the Republic and Jedi&mdash;and on at least one occasion, being one of the few pilots to make it home alive.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" /> He was one of the pilots asked to test the experimental Star Saber Starfighters, and showed his proficiency with Jedi levitation when he lowered himself to the ground with the Force after an accidental crash. Dace later led an aerial attack on Kemplex Nine.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War\" /> He was also one of several Jedi to be taught how to fly the [[Drexl|war beasts]] of Onderon.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDace Diath first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Freedon Nadd Uprising]]''.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising\" /> In the ''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]'', it is incorrectly stated that it was Dace Diath and Oss Wilum who were asked to test the experimental Star Saber Starfighters.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\" /> As per the sub-series [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith|''Dark Lords of the Sith'']] of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] series of [[Star Wars comic books|comics]], it was Dace and Cay Qel-Droma who were asked to try out the new starfighters.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith\" />\n\nDiath is also absent from both the ''Tales of the Jedi'' and ''Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio dramas, despite playing a significant role in the events covered by each.<ref name=\"Tales audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio drama]]</ref><ref name=\"Lords audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio drama]]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Dace Diath}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 1]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 3]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 6]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 2]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 4|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|26|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 1}}\n*{{InsiderCite|28|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 3}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]''\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dace Diath\n|pl=Dace Diath\n|ru=\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441 \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diath, Dace}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
