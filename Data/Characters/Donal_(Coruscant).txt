After the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] began and the [[Jedi Temple]] was [[Operation: Knightfall|emptied]], Donal met up with the woman named [[Fy-Tor-Ana|Solace]]. Solace, who in reality was former [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] Fy-Tor-Ana, was forming a resistance group in the planet's crust.\n\nWhen Solace agreed to accompany former Jedi [[Ferus Olin]] to the Jedi Temple in an effort to prevent [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Malorum]] from discovering the underground settlement, Donal accepted Solace's request to stay as guardian and leader of the camp. When the two Jedi returned to the settlement and found it in ruins, Solace felt that Donal had been a double-agent planted by Malorum.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Underworld]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
