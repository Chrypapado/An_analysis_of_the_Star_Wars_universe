After the crime lord warned the bounty hunters of interfering with the Jedi while she was on the moon, Dezanti and [[Azanti Zhug]]&mdash;the Zhug leaders representing their organization in the meeting&mdash;proclaimed that G0-T0 was mad for not allowing them to hunt when she was finally so close after they had been searching for the Jedi around [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. When Surik was invited to meet the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] [[Visquis]]&mdash;G0-T0's representative on the moon's surface&mdash;to discuss the bounty on her head, she was consequently captured and then [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] by the crime organization aboard the ''Visionary''. The bounty hunters believed that the truce was off, taking the meeting as permission to begin their hunt. Too eager to wait for Dezanti to join them, Azanti and two other Zhug brothers [[Mission to Nar Shaddaa (First Jedi Purge)|attacked]] Surik's companions on the Smuggler's Moon, and eight Zhug brothers attacked Surik aboard the ''Visionary'', unsuccessfully.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n[[File:IfYouSquintYouCanSeeStarships-KOTOR2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A ''Heraklon''-class transport ship&mdash;the same class as the Zhugs' freighter]]\nAfter the Zhug brothers had failed in their attacks on Nar Shaddaa, Dezanti pursued Surik to the planet [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]].
