He was also the [[Treasurer of Telos|treasurer]] on [[Telos IV]] during the reign of [[Xanatos]].\n\n==Biography==\nChun was manipulated into using Telos's gambling craze, [[Katharsis]], as a method to fund [[UniFy]] and, ultimately, [[Offworld Mining Corporation]]. After [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] exposed the plot, with the help of [[Denetrus|Den]] and [[Andra (Telos IV)|Andra]] (Telosians) Vox Chun was placed in prison.\n\nSoon after, he pursued his elder son's death in a [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's Senate hearing|hearing]], attempting to pin blame on young Obi-Wan for Bruck's death. His attempt failed, due to the fact that [[Xanatos]] had put a recording chip in Bruck's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. The senate was able play the tape of the fight between Obi-Wan and Bruck. Vox was left bitter and yearning for revenge.\n\nTwelve years later, he once again encountered Obi-Wan, now a grown man and Jedi, while living on his remaining son's colony ship, full of disillusioned idealists. He was in the process of dealing with Offworld Corporation, behind his son Kad's back, for the stealing of the ship's treasury, along with an operative and spy, a 'no name'. His plan backfired when he and his accomplice (a senate no-name called [[Tarrence Chenati]]) were not going to make it out cleanly and the no name mortally wounded him with his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. Vox Chun died in his son's arms, but not before requesting and receiving Kad's forgiveness for his selfish lifelong plotting.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vox Chun#legends\n|es=Vox Chun\n|ru=\u0412\u043e\u043a\u0441 \u0427\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chun, Vox}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
