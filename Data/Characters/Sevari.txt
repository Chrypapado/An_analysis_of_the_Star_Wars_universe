Not much was known of their history, but it was speculated that they were the descendants of an expedition that took place early in the history of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Historical data suggest a connection between the Sevari and a [[Colony ship/Legends|colony ship]] called the ''[[Sevari Cabal]]'' which was lost.\n\n==Society and culture==\nThe Sevari lived in clans that oversaw the mining and trading of spice, although the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] controlled it during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], each clan having its own rigid social structure. Arranged intermarriages to avoid feuds were quite common. Each clan was ruled by a much respected [[clan leader]], who in turn was subordinate to a [[clan lord]] who maintained stability over multiple augmentative clans. The strongest clan lords were granted the title of [[spice lord]]s.\n\nThe clans in the [[Southern Deserts]] were largely nomadic, while those of the [[Northern Frontier]] lived in the shelters of the mining operations in the mountains. The clans of the [[Equatorial Belt]] were typically the most wealthy due to the rich abundance of spice in that area. The clans would meet annually at the [[Festival of the High Winds]], where the Sevari would hold religious ceremonies and participate in wind race tournaments, while the Spice Lords discussed space mining and trade.\n\n==Technology==\nThe Sevari shunned modern technology and preferred ancient technology reminiscent of what was seen in the early days of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]], such as sail driven [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles, referred to as [[wind rider]]s. They would also make use of [[Sevari Flashpistol|flashpistol]] technology rather than [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] weapons.\n\n==Spice narcosis==\nThe Sevari had developed immunity towards the effects of spice, but were prone to going into [[spice narcosis]] when venturing off the planet into spice free atmospheres.\n\n==Known Sevari==\nThe Sevari were rather reclusive and secretive and only few were well known outside of the Sevari society. Three prominent Sevari Spice Lords during the Galactic Civil War were [[Xerxes Quintas]] of the [[Southern Deserts]], [[Cassius Nolath Rha]] of the [[Equatorial Belt]], and [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Trevael]] of the [[Northern Frontier]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|12|Festival of High Winds}}\n*{{Journal|4|It's a Gambler's Life}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|2|The Free-Trader's Guide to Sevarcos}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Free-Trader's Guide to Sevarcos}}\n*''[[Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear]]''\n\n[[Category:Human races]]\n[[Category:Sevari| ]]"}}}]}}}}
