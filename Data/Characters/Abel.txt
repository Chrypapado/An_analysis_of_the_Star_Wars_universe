He was the muscle in a group of thugs who roamed a major [[City/Legends|city]] on the planet. When [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] arrived on the world to buy supplies from an [[Ortolan/Legends|Ortolan]] [[Unidentified Ortolan merchant|merchant]], Abel and the rest of the gang encountered the young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. The leader of the gang ordered Abel to take Skywalker to the roof, apparently to mug him. However, when Abel and the rest of the group arrived, Luke used his quick reflexes and his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to turn on his would-be captors. The fast spin with his weapon caught Abel off-guard, and he was killed.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars 3-D 3|''Star Wars 3-D'' 3]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
