The Families of Cestus Cybernetics aspired to overthrow the Regent [[G'Mai Duris]] from the government.\n\n[[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and the [[Vippit]] [[Doolb Snoil]] arrived on Ord Cestus and were able to persuade the Regent to distrust the Families. The leaders went into hiding; [[Caiza Quill]], Lord and Lady Por'Ten, and [[Debbikin the Young]] used a magcar to move through the subterranean tunnels, though [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]] staged a kidnapping of the Por'Tens and their allies. They were \"librated\" by Kenobi, thus ensuring Cestus' loyalty to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. However, the Jedi sham was ultimately revealed to the Regent, who turned against the Jedi in favor of Por'Ten's ilk once more.\n\nFinally, the [[Five Families]], allied with [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], used the [[JK-13 security droid]]s against the [[Desert Wind]]. When the conflict became unstable, [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] decided to send the [[supercruiser]] [[Nexu (starship)|''Nexu'']]. With ''Nexu'' in orbit, the Five Families, including the Por'Ten, took refuge in a secret bunker that was soon discovered by [[Advanced Recon Commando/Legends|ARC trooper]] [[Alpha-98|Jangotat]]. Jangotat, trapped within the bunker, transmitted a code ordering ''Nexu'' to target his location. The bunker and all its occupants were killed in the blast.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Cestus Deception]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Por'Ten\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cestians|Por'Ten, Lord]]\n[[Category:Confederacy of Independent Systems individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans|Por'Ten, Lord]]\n[[Category:Males|Por'Ten, Lord]]"}}}]}}}}
