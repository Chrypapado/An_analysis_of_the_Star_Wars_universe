Kill me. My creature, Pateesa, is dead. All my beasts are gone&mdash;|Malakili, to Cobb Vanth|audio=Malakili_-_I_have_no_value_to_you.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Malakili''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] who spent much of his [[Youngling|childhood]] living in the slums of the [[moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Having an affinity for [[Species|animals]], Malakili was hired as a [[beastmaster]] for [[Hutt]] [[circus]]es, but he was sold into [[slavery]] after a creature got loose and [[Death|killed]] audience members. Purchased by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]], Malakili served as a caretaker to the creatures in [[Jabba's Palace]] on the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]]. During that [[time]], Malakili became fond of Jabba's [[rancor]], [[Pateesa]], and the creature saved his life during a [[Tusken Raider]] attack. Sympathizing with Pateesa, Malakili planned to one [[Standard day|day]] escape with the beast.\n\nIn [[4 ABY]], [[Luke Skywalker]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] arrived at Jabba's Palace in an attempt to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] [[Han Solo]]. Skywalker was tricked into Jabba's rancor pit, where, to Malakili's distress, the rebel killed Pateesa. In the aftermath, Skywalker escaped with Solo, and Jabba was killed. Over the following [[Standard month|months]], Malakili was one of the last to leave the palace, and he wandered into the [[Dune Sea]] toward the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. Feeling purposeless without his creatures, Malakili considered committing [[suicide]], and he wandered further into the desert.\n\nIn the desert, Malakili was attacked by the [[Red Key Raiders]], criminals who had risen to power in Jabba's absence, but he was rescued by [[Sheriff]] [[Cobb Vanth]] and [[Issa-Or]], self-proclaimed [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcers]]. When the two learned Malakili was a beastmaster, they offered him a job in [[Mos Pelgo|Freetown]] to work with [[ronto]]s and [[Teacher|teach]] a [[Borgo|Huttlet]]. Malakili accepted the position and felt he had regained purpose. Vanth was concerned about the growing power of the Red Key Raiders, so with Malakili's help, the sheriff formed an alliance with a group of Tusken Raiders. Later, when Freetown was attacked by Red Key thugs, the Tusken Raiders arrived to help. Eventually, Malakili was reunited with [[Porcellus]], the former head [[chef]] of Jabba's Palace. Together, they traveled to [[Mos Eisley]] and opened the [[Crystal Moon Restaurant]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Beastmaster for the Hutts===\n{{Quotetrans|Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

During Malakili's time at Jabba's Palace, he became very fond of the rancor, and he, along with the [[Kadas'sa'Nikto]] [[Giran]], considered Pateesa to be their favorite of Jabba's creatures. Pateesa also had a fondness for Malakili, and one [[Standard day|day]], when the beastmaster was attacked by [[Tusken Raider]]s, the rancor saved his life.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> In Jabba's Palace, Malakili grew sympathetic toward Pateesa, and he planned to one day escape with the creature.<ref name=\"Head-to-Head\" />\n\nShortly before the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]],<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]], a [[commander]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], attempted a [[Rescue of Han Solo|bargain]] with Jabba to save the life of his captured friend, [[Han Solo]]. Jabba declined the offer and tricked the Jedi,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> who, along with the [[Gamorrean]] guard [[Jubnuk]],<ref name=\"Complete Locations\" /> fell through a trap door leading to the palace's rancor pit. While the guard was promptly eaten by Pateesa, Skywalker evaded the beast's claws and ran under the pit's gate toward a [[Viewport|windowed]] back door. When Skywalker reached the exit, he discovered it was locked from the other side and would not open for him.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Malakili and Giran were in the adjoining chamber, playfully fighting over their dinner, and when Skywalker tried opening the barred gate, the two laughed at the rebel and used [[spear]]s to force him away.<ref name=\"Return of the Jedi\">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Malakili_weeping.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Malakili and Giran weep at Pateesa's demise.]]\nAs the rancor approached Skywalker, the cornered Jedi picked up a [[Skeleton|skull]], and he used [[the Force]] to propel it toward the gate's utility panel. The [[bone]] smashed the button, causing the panel to short-circuit and release the gate down upon the rancor's head, crushing the beast's skull.<ref name=\"Beware\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Shocked,<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Malakili opened the door, rushed to Pateesa's side, and wept upon seeing he was dead. Whimpering, Malakili turned away from the fallen beast, placing an [[Limb|arm]] around Giran for comfort.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n===Leaving the palace===\nFollowing the rancor's death, Jabba demanded that Skywalker and his friends be taken to the [[Dune Sea]] and executed in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], the resting place of a [[sarlacc]], a dangerous creature and one of Jabba's favorite pets. While Jabba left aboard his [[sail barge]], the ''[[Khetanna]]'', to witness the execution,<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Malakili remained in the palace with several others. However, the rebels escaped, killed Jabba, and destroyed the sail barge, leaving the palace residents unsure of what to do. The inhabitants of Jabba's Palace said that a new Hutt would come to take the castle, so Malakili remained, waiting for his new employer to arrive.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nAfter a time, the palace began to run out of food and [[water]], but Malakili and many other residents still stayed. Some of the palace dwellers realized that no Hutt was coming, creating rumors that changes in the [[galaxy]] had caused fighting to erupt among the Hutts in an underworld war. As many of the tenants left, Malakili became one of the last to remain in the otherwise empty fortress, but one day he also left, putting the palace<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> and the unmoved carcass of Pateesa<ref name=\"Battlefront\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''&mdash;''Outer Rim''</ref> behind him.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n[[File:Dune_Sea.png|thumb|left|300px|Without his creatures, Malakili felt purposeless and wandered the Dune Sea.]]\nFeeling purposeless without Pateesa and his other creatures, Malakili set out toward the Great Pit of Carkoon, creating an ultimatum for himself: successfully tame the sarlacc, or commit [[suicide]] by throwing himself into the monster's [[mouth]]. When Malakili reached the sarlacc, he found it was injured; the ''Khetanna''{{'s}} destruction had sent [[Fire|burning]] wreckage onto the creature, partially exposing its massive body from the sand, and [[Jawa]]s had slit open its [[Stomach|stoma-tubes]] to [[Scavenger|scavenge]] weapons, [[armor]], [[droid]]s, and tools. Upon seeing the sarlacc wailing, unable to fend off pillagers and deprived of its sole purpose, Malakili empathized with the creature and wept.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Finding purpose===\n{{Quote|We got a couple [of] unruly rontos that could use a steady hand.

En route, he was found by two thugs of the [[Red Key Raiders]], a criminal syndicate that posed as a [[mining]] company. Malakili ran from the gang, but he was older and slower than he once had been, and the thugs quickly caught up, knocking him to the ground and rummaging through his few belongings. One of the thugs took Malakili's [[waterskin]], drank what was left, and introduced himself as [[Bivvam Gorge]]. Gorge declared that the area was the territory of the Red Key, and that the leader of the syndicate, [[Lorgan Movellan]], deserved his cut of Malakili's possessions. A [[blaster]] bolt then struck and killed Gorge, and the [[Unidentified Red Key Raider|remaining thug]] began firing at the attackers before being shot himself. Malakili feared the gunmen were also raiders, so he played dead.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThe new arrivals, a human man and a [[Twi'lek]] woman, approached Malakili, introducing themselves as [[Cobb Vanth]] and [[Issa-Or]]. Vanth explained that he was a [[Law enforcement agency|lawman]] and de facto [[mayor]] of Mos Pelgo, which had been renamed Freetown. When the pair asked Malakili if he had any skills, he stated that he was worthless without his creatures. Issa-Or asked Malakili if he was a beastmaster, and he replied that he was. Hearing this, Vanth offered Malakili a job taming [[ronto]]s, which the trainer accepted. Asked if he could train a Huttlet, the beastmaster replied that he could [[Teacher|teach]] one and agreed to work with Vanth in Freetown.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Feeling a new sense of purpose, Malakili taught the Huttlet, whom he named [[Borgo]], in Freetown. Vanth, acting as Freetown's [[sheriff]], was wary of the Red Key's growing power, so he made a deal with a group of Tusken Raiders, who agreed to leave Freetown alone in exchange for water. To complete the deal, Malakili procured a [[krayt dragon pearl]], gifting it to the Tusken Raiders in exchange for their protection.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Mos_Eisley.png|thumb|left|300px|Malakili eventually traveled to Mos Eisley, where he opened a restaurant with Porcellus.]]\nMonths into Malakili's stay, the alliance was put to use when an [[army]] of Red Key Raiders, led by Movellan, [[Skirmish in Freetown|attacked]] Freetown. During the raid, Malakili was chained up by Movellan's thugs, and he, along with Vanth and Borgo, was dragged into the town's center. As Movellan prepared to kill them, Vanth signaled Malakili with a nod and a wink, and the beastmaster returned the nod, instructing Borgo to alert the Tuskens. However, [[Trayness]], a Red Key thug, clubbed Malakili in the head, causing the man to clutch the [[Blood|bleeding]] wound and fall. Responding to Malakili's order, the Huttlet released a howl, and soon after, the town's front gates opened as a Tusken astride a massive [[bantha]] charged toward the Red Key thugs. As more Tuskens arrived, Malakili used a [[magna-driver]] to remove his and Vanth's shackles, and the lawman attacked Movellan, stating that Freetown would never submit.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nSometime after the skirmish, Malakili was reunited with [[Porcellus]], the former head [[chef]] of Jabba's Palace. The two became business partners, and they eventually traveled to [[Mos Eisley]], where they opened the [[Crystal Moon Restaurant]].<ref name=\"Complete Locations\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You know much about Hutts?''\"<br />\"''I know quite a bit.''\"<br />\"''You think you could train one?''\"<br />\"''I&hellip;they are sentient beings, not pets.''\"<br />\"''Fine.

Upon finding the creature severely wounded, the beastmaster sympathized with the monster, as its only purpose had been taken from it, and he wept for its fate. Malakili believed that his sole purpose in life was working with animals, and he felt useless without his creatures. As he wandered the deserts of Tatooine, the beastmaster felt like a scrap of cloth or piece of trash being blown across the sand without destination or meaning, and he believed he was going to die. After Cobb Vanth rescued Malakili from Red Key Raiders, the sheriff told him that he looked familiar, but the Corellian responded that he was no one. Malakili added that he had no value or use to Vanth, and he told the man to kill him.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhen Issa-Or inquired if Malakili was a beastmaster, the human thought he was undeserving of the word \"master,\" but he acknowledged that he trained beasts. Once Vanth offered Malakili a job in Freetown, the beastmaster felt that he had found a new purpose, and he felt the darkness inside of his [[heart]] be replaced with light.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Malakili stayed in Freetown for months, and during the raid on Freetown, he felt gleeful, despite receiving injuries.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nDespite being a slave to Jabba,<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> Malakili saw the Hutt as an employer who provided him with food, a home, and a purpose.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> However, he felt hatred towards the Hutt for how he treated Pateesa.<ref name=\"HC 37\" /> When Vanth and Issa-Or introduced themselves as law enforcers, the former slave did not believe them, nor did he believe there could be any law on Tatooine without the Hutts. Malakili considered the Hutts [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, not pets, and he thus corrected Vanth after being asked if he could train a Huttlet, remarking he could instead teach one. Once Vanth reworded the proposition, the beastmaster accepted.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Later, Malakili named the Huttlet Borgo, and during the raid on Freetown, the beastmaster comforted Borgo using a singsong voice.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|You a beastmaster?''\"<br />\"''I train beasts.

The human was hired as a beastmaster for Hutt circuses, and he trained a variety of creatures, including sand dragons, kill-wings, womp [[rat]]s, and rancors, the latter of which no one else could tame. During his slavery to Jabba, Malakili worked with the Hutt's creatures, including the rancor Pateesa. The slave befriended the rancor and tended wounds he received, and Pateesa saved Malakili's life during a Tusken Raider attack.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Malakili was not [[Force-sensitive]], and was not talented in speed or diplomacy.
