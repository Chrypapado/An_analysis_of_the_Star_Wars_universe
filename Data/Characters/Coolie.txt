That means your uncle Dro is related to my aunt Coolie...|Luke Skywalker|Children of the Jedi (novel)}}\n'''Coolie''' was apparently an aunt, real or adoptive, of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the novel [[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']], when [[Callista Ming]] told Luke about her uncle [[Dro]]'s opposition to anyone having fun, the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] laughingly remarked that \"your uncle Dro [must be] related to my aunt Coolie.\" However, Luke's aunt Coolie does not appear to be referred to in any other source.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, the exchange in question took place in a dreamscape, while a feverish and injured Luke was trapped aboard the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] battlemoon ''[[Eye of Palpatine]]'' and Callista was a disembodied consciousness trapped inside the ship's gunnery computer.\n\nBased on this one reference, if Coolie existed (rather than being a figment of Luke's fevered imagination) and was a nominal relative of Luke's (rather than an \"honorary aunt\"), she was probably a member of either the [[Lars family/Legends|Lars family]] or the [[Whitesun family]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Females|Coolie]]\n[[Category:Humans|Coolie]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Coolie]]"}}}]}}}}
