He was a cousin to the Executive Officer of SoroSuub, who gave Te'Suub the position because of a favor owed to Miim's mother. The position held little real authority. He met with those outsiders with whom the actual executives of Edic Bar did not want to meet with. The company taught Te'Suub a \"Formal Greeting\" to use with his guests, as a way to discourage them from contacting SoroSuub again.<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nMiim Te'Suub was directed by his employers to give a speech when the first of SoroSuub's [[G-59 Cannibalizer]]s came off the line, and to give the employees the day off. Te'Suub was aghast at the four-day party that followed (and the eventual creation of an anniversary party called the [[Festival]]), but the situation was not beyond what his employers expected when they told him to do it.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nDuring the [[SoroSuub Anniversary celebration, 31 BBY|Festival of 31 BBY]], Te'Suub traditional annual speech was disturbed by the superimposition of the logo of the [[Metatheran Cartel]]. Te'Suub angrily challenged Cartel representative [[Thurm Loogg]], being the argument heated enough to require the mediation of diplomats and Jedi consuls.<ref name=\"BW\">''[[Blown Away]]'' (as described in [https://web.archive.org/web/20021218152817/www.wizards.com/rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20010927b_transmissions&c=swlfc Transmissions From the Living Force Campaign] on the [[Wikipedia:Internet Archive#Wayback machine|Way back machine]])</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMiim believed he was doing an important job for SoroSuub, and enjoyed his work.
