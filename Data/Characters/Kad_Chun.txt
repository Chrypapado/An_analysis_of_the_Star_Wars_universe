His father was long under the influence of [[Xanatos]], the rogue [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], and Kad was born into a world of distrust and manipulation.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I will never forgive you Obi-Wan Kenobi. In my eyes, you will always be a killer.|Kad about [[Bruck Chun|Bruck's]] death to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]|Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions}}\nKad Chun's older brother, [[Bruck Chun|Bruck]], had been taken to the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to be trained as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] very early, quite possibly before Kad was born. When his older brother, his hero, was killed, he blamed the young [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and could believe no wrong of his late brother. He seemed to hate Obi-Wan for Bruck's death, and almost gave in to his anger and hurt him.\n\nTwelve years after the events surrounding his brother's death, Kad resurfaced as Uni, leader of a following of disenchanted idealists and \"refugees\" each leaving their planet's downward spirals. His [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Vox Chun|Vox]], now an old man, had also followed, and both still remained bitter towards Obi-Wan until Vox's selfish plan was uncovered and backfired, resulting in his death. Kad was able to forgive both his scheming father and Obi-Wan. He then went on his way in the universe, presumably to higher goals than leading his people to run away.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kad Chun\n|es=Kad Chun\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chun, Kad}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
