Around the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], he captured an [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Youngling/Legends|boy]] named [[Tomo]], whom Neg forced to work without respite for [[Standard month/Legends|months]]. However, while the captain was [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]], [[Tomo's mother]] met [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], who agreed to help free her son.

He resided in a [[Captain Neg's house|house]] there, which was guarded by a [[model Dz5 security door]] equipped with [[Artificial intelligence/Legends|artificial intelligence]]. The building also housed a [[red]]-plated [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], as well as several thugs armed with [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistols]]. In addition, Neg owned a [[Neg's monster|furry, violent beast]], which he kept in a cage in the backyard of his house.<ref name=\"PMvg\" /> Circa [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"Chronology\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Neg captured a young [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Youngling/Legends|boy]] named [[Tomo]],<ref name=\"PMgg\">''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref> whom he forced to become his servant while making false promises that he would one day free the boy.<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n\n===A visit by a Jedi===\n{{Quote|Where is Captain Neg?''\"<br />\"''He's hunting banthas in the Dune Sea and won't be back for a week.|Qui-Gon Jinn and Tomo|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\n[[File:Negbeast.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Qui-Gon Jinn battles Neg's monster.]]\nMany [[Standard month/Legends|months]] later, during the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], Neg went to the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]] for approximately a [[Standard week/Legends|week]] to [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]] [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] and had Tomo placed inside a cage next to his beast. Meanwhile, Tomo's [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Tomo's mother|mother]], who was desperate to save her son, placed herself near Neg's house in the hopes of finding an individual who could help her.<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\nHelp arrived in the form of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], who was looking for a [[T-14 hyperdrive generator/Legends|T-14 hyperdrive generator]] on the planet. When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] walked past the Ithorian mother, she [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] that [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] was strong with him and begged for his assistance. Agreeing to speak with Neg, Jinn went to request an audience with Neg, but he was refused entry by the captain's [[Model Dz5 security door|security door system]]. After finding another way into the house, Jinn encountered several of Neg's thugs, but he quickly [[Death/Legends|dispatched]] his opponents. Jinn also fought and killed [[Neg's monster|Neg's beast]] after it broke free from its cage and attacked him. The Jedi Master then freed Tomo from his cage and, after discovering that Neg would not be back for a week, left the house with the boy.<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|He always promises to free Tomo, but I know that he never will.|Tomo's mother, on Neg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\nCaptain Neg was not above capturing a young boy to work for him. He often promised that Tomo would one day be free, but Tomo's mother had reason to believe that Neg was lying and that the captain would keep Tomo in captivity indefinitely. Neg longed to hunt banthas and was ready to take time away from home to hunt them.<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNeg was only mentioned in the [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]]. In the [[video game]]'s sixth level, after Jinn&mdash;who is controlled by the player&mdash;rescues Tomo, the Ithorian's mother will reward the Jedi with a [[repulse booster]], which is needed to complete the level by trading it for another item. However, a simpler way to obtain the booster is for Jinn to murder Tomo's mother and forcibly take it, leaving Tomo behind.<ref name=\"PMvg\" /> Due to this alternative path, whether or not Jinn's rescue of Tomo [[canon]]ically took place is ambiguous. This article assumes 100% game completion with no \"[[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]\" options, however, describing the events as if Jinn chose to free Tomo instead of killing the Ithorian mother.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Neg\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
