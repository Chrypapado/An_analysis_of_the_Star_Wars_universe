He became known as one of the fathers of modern smuggling on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]].\n\n==Biography==\nAncher and Paulsen were imprisoned on [[Omman Minor|Omman]], and though they eventually escaped with the help of [[Tait Ransom]], Ancher was forced to have a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic leg]] fitted as a result. Ancher later retired to Socorro and established the [[Black Dust Tavern]]. He was also one of the three owners of the [[Ethra Brewery]], and gained a reputation as one of the most honest businessbeings on Socorro.\n\nAncher was tending bar at the Black Dust Tavern when [[Arner Figgis]] showed up and attempted to greet the man in [[Olys Corellisi|Old Corellian]]. Unfortunately the scholar misspoke and insulted the bartender. Ancher was angered but was calmed down by Figgis' companion [[Trep Winterrs]]. Figgis bought Ancher a drink as an apology.<ref name=\"AJ7\">{{Journal|7|Old Corellian: A Guide for the Curious Scholar}}</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|2|Out of the Cradle}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|3|When the Domino Falls}}\n*{{Journal|5|A Bitter Winter}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|7|Old Corellian: A Guide for the Curious Scholar}}\n*{{GamerCite|2|A Credit for Your Thoughts}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Black Sands of Socorro|story=Rude Awakening (short story)|stext=''Rude Awakening''}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ancher, Karl Mathieu}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs with prosthetics]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Individuals with lost limbs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
