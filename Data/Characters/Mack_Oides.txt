This character's skill would depend on the player character's and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Oides would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by The Cell because the PC could filter Oides's name as a Cell member.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oides, Mack}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
