The novel also mentions that he has a son, one over which he appears to have full custody, as he is the one who gives his son over to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Finally, the novel also implies that it was Lorn's discharge from service at the [[Jedi Temple]] that sent his life into a tailspin. It was presumed from ''Shadow Hunter'' that \"Siena\" was Lorn's wife; this was confirmed in ''[[Coruscant Nights I: Jedi Twilight]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Coruscant Nights I: Jedi Twilight]]'' {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti|Pavan, Siena]]\n[[Category:Females|Pavan, Siena]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives|Pavan, Siena]]\n[[Category:Humans|Pavan, Siena]]"}}}]}}}}
