As such, she would notably remind the queen of her schedule for the [[Standard day|day]]. In truth, Queen Breha regarded her as more than just an [[aide]], but as a friend. Visaiya was so important to Organa that the queen often joked that losing her would be like cutting off a hand. As a symbol of their friendship, the two even had matching [[silver]] rings they each wore on their right index fingers.<ref name=\"Eclipse\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=Eclipse (short story)|sformatted=Eclipse|book=From a Certain Point of View}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
