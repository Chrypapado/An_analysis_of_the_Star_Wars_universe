I have another call.|Thrynka Padaunete|HoloNet News Vol. 531 51}}\n'''Thrynka Padaunete''' was the founder and [[President/Legends|leader]] of the [[People's Inquest]], a grassroots [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] watchgroup.\n\n==Biography==\nThrynka Padaunete believed that the Jedi were manipulating the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in their own push for power, so she founded the group People's Inquest and became its first president. She was often interviewed for articles pertaining to Jedi controversies on the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]. Since the people of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] financed the Jedi Order, she believed that the people should be able to hold them accountable for their actions - though she found them at fault more often than not.\n\nIn [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], a groundquake on [[Ord Thoden]] left the one-year old [[Aris-Del Wari|Ludi Billane]] orphaned, and she was rescued by the Jedi on the scene. As she was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], they took her to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to begin her [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]]. When it was discovered that her mother, [[Jonava Billane]], was alive and wanted her daughter back, the Jedi refused, claiming it would be dangerous since the child - now called Aris-Del Wari - had been introduced to the ways of the Force. Padaunete lent her group's support to Billane, and held this incident as evidence the Jedi should be scrutinized closer than they had been.\n\nAfter the Jedi failed to prevent the [[Battle of Antar 4]], public support for the Order dropped and the People's Inquest gained momentum.\n\nWhen the Jedi Order unveiled their new starfighter, the [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor/Legends|Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor]], the People's Inquest demanded that the Order release their budgetary information, so the people of the Republic could see how much was being spent for the Jedi's needs. After the [[Judicial Department/Legends|Judicial Department]] denied their requests based on security concerns, Padaunete held a rally in front of the [[Jedi Temple]]. She called the new starfighter a \"shiny toy\", that shouldn't take precedence when the people of the Republic were having trouble making ends meet. She claimed their petition had garnered several million signatures.\n\nEight weeks after Aris-Del Wari was taken by the Jedi Order, Padaunete had taken on the role of Billane's appearance manager. She and Billane appeared on the [[holoprogram]], [[Essence]]. Billane appealed to the Jedi Order yet again to let her take her child back, but refused to discuss the new [[Untitled Baby Ludi Project]] holo feature, which was reported to be worth over 100 million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Padaunete changed the subject back to the Jedi, claiming they were nothing better than a cult that only sought to further their own agenda. She also claimed that they had decided that \"a mother's love is wrong\". A copy of the holoprogram was then put up for sale, with some of the proceeds going to People's Inquest.\n\nWhen twenty university students stormed the Jedi Temple in support for Billane and overwhelmed two young [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] was forced to use a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to convince the students to disperse quietly. After the students were arrested, the HoloNet News tried to reach Billane for a comment, but she was too busy reviewing the script for the holo feature. Padaunete, now Billane's spokeswoman and agent, responded quickly, but was busy herself fielding other calls.\n\nShe soon became too busy to engage in the activities of her group, and instead went to [[Kassido]] to review casting auditions with Billane. She was immediately succeeded by [[Firris Palbert]] as President of People's Inquest, who held a rally outside the Jedi Temple after Wari was moved to the [[Kamparas Jedi Training Center]].\n\nIn the wake of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], her group aided the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] by compiling a list of all known Jedi that were still at large, along with information on other Force-using sects.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe illustration of Thrynka Padaunete appearing in [[Star Wars Insider 71|''Star Wars Insider'' 71]]<ref name=\"Insider 71\">[[Star Wars Insider 71|''Star Wars Insider'' 71]]</ref> was by [[Joe Corroney]], based on a photo of model [[Anastasia Heonis]] (aka Acid PopTart) by Laura Dark.<ref name=\"Anastasia\">{{FacebookCite|profilelink=theAcidPopTart|url=photos/251913361530|author=Acid PopTart|description=About Thrynka Padaunete|dateposted=January 12, 2010|quote=Myself modeling for Thrynka, a leader of the Rebel Alliance, for yes, freakin' Star Wars.
