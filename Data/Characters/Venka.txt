A [[Coruscanti/Legends|native]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Capital/Legends|throne world]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Venka had a spoiled childhood, raised the son of a wealthy industrialist. Venka attended one of the oldest military training academies in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], where his many connections helped him graduate at the top of his class.\n\nAfter the Empire's catastrophe at the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Venka was one of many non-commissioned personnel promoted to fill the void of so many [[Officer/Legends|officers]] lost in the destruction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]]. Venka's academy connections earned him a prestigious assignment to the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']], the personal [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], at the young age of twenty-seven.

Venka secretly detested Piett for the denial, but he nevertheless resolved to do his job the best he could. At the conclusion of the Hoth campaign, which ultimately saw the escape of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], Vader's son, Piett finally granted Venka his promotion to captain.\n\n==Biography==\n===Privileged Coruscant upbringing===\n{{Quote|The big lizard-man is Bossk, Admiral.

However, much to Venka's displeasure, Piett denied him a corresponding promotion to captain, saying that the remainder of the [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] campaign would be a test of his command abilities.

Disappointed with his crew's inability to capture the Rebel fugitives on their flight from Hoth, Vader summoned a group of six [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] aboard the ''Executor'' to bring him the elusive ''Millennium Falcon'' where the Imperials had failed.<ref name=\"GG3 2nd\" /> Upon the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunters' arrival, Venka directed the motley group to wait for Vader on the bridge, but Piett warned Venka to watch the bounty hunters' every move, for they were all notorious killers.

Arranging the boarding party proved to be Venka's last task as lieutenant, as the ''Millennium Falcon'' unexpectedly jumped into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] to escape the ''Executor''{{'s}} pursuit for good. Afterward, Piett, realizing how lucky he was to avoid execution at Vader's hands for losing the Rebels, finally promoted Venka to captain.<ref name=\"GG3 2nd\" /> Eventually, in the aftermath of the Hoth campaign, captaincy of the ''Executor'' passed from Venka to Captain [[Kallic]], who assumed temporary command of Vader's flagship.<ref name=\"Piett Databank\">{{DB|character|admiralpiett|Piett, Admiral|archivedate=20110517074252}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Snap to it, soldier.|Lieutenant Venka|Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back}}\nLieutenant Venka secretly despised Firmus Piett for Piett's decision to deny Venka a promotion to captain following Piett's own promotion to admiral.
