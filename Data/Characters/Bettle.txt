The two became notable in smuggling circles, and their exploits were regularly featured in [[Cynabar's InfoNet]]. Bettle assisted the resistance on [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]] and was present when the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Battle of Ralltiir (4 ABY)|liberated]] the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] from [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] control. Later, she and Jaxa became members of [[Talon Karrde]]'s [[Smugglers' Alliance]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and smuggling===\nThe [[Ralltiiri]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Bettle was one of two [[Parent/Legends|daughters]] of [[Jerell]], a resistance leader of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]]; [[Bettle's sister|the other]] was [[Death/Legends|dead]] by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of Ralltiir's [[Battle of Ralltiir (4 ABY)|liberation]], a death her father blamed on [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Governor/Legends|governor]] [[Dennix Graeber]].<ref name=\"Heroes\" /> She later became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and the partner of [[Jaxa]].<ref name=\"SWAJ3\">{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> By [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]'' establishes the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] as having occurred in 35:3 under the [[Great ReSynchronization]] dating system. Bettle and [[Jaxa]]'s first appearance in [[Cynabar's InfoNet]], \"Ralltiir Wide Open\" from ''[[Galaxywide NewsNets]]'' in ''[[Star Wars Adventure Journal 3]]'', is dated 35:6:16, less than four [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the Battle of Yavin, and thus within [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]].</ref> the pair and their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Mallixer]]'', had become famous enough to be tracked by [[Cynabar's InfoNet]], an elite smuggling [[NewsNet]].<ref name=\"SWAJ3\" />\n\nWhen the Empire cracked down on Ralltiir, Bettle and Jaxa were one of many groups of smugglers who attempted to run the [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]] with supplies for the cut-off world.<ref name=\"SWAJ3\" /> However, that venture was fruitless, and the pair began marketing [[Slugthrower/Legends|slugthrowers]] to various warring [[Species/Legends|species]] located beyond the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]]. That project was more successful, and the pair brought back a full cargo of [[canta salt]] and [[havao tabacc]], although the ''Mallixer'' was damaged in the process.<ref name=\"SWAJ5\">{{Journal|5|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\nBettle could not escape her heritage, however, and her father convinced her to assist in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], joking that it paid her better than her smuggling did.<ref name=\"Heroes\" /> She began by running guns to Ralltiir with Jaxa, despite the latter's displeasure with the venture's riskiness and with the near-snagging of the ''Mallixer'' by Imperial forces.<ref name=\"SWAJ10\">{{Journal|10|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> The disagreement strained their relationship, but they soon worked out their disagreements and were again operating as a team to make the \"[[Spirva Run]],\" smuggling items from [[Galladinium's Galactic Datalog of Fantastic Technology|Galladinium's Datalog]] to rioters in the [[Spirva sector/Legends|Spirva sector]].<ref name=\"SWAJ14\">{{Journal|14|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> During their career, the pair visited at least thirty-four [[Shadowport/Legends|shadowports]] around [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"DarkStryder\">''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]''</ref>\n\n===After Endor===\nEventually, Bettle became more directly involved with the Rebellion. Following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], she was present with her father in an underground communications center on Ralltiir. While she was monitoring communications from a strike team led by [[Spike (individual)|Spike]], Governor Graeber initiated communication with Jerell, taunting him with the fact that the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had not yet taken a single [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]]. In the midst of that communication, Spike's team destroyed the planet's [[Power generator/Legends|power generators]]; meanwhile, a task force of six [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]s entered the [[Ralltiir system|star system]], ensuring that Ralltiir would be the first Core World to fall to the New Republic.<ref name=\"Heroes\" />\n\nBettle returned to smuggling with her old compatriot after the victory. During the [[Thrawn campaign]], [[Talon Karrde]] formed the [[Smugglers' Alliance]], an organization which Bettle and Jaxa eventually joined. When the New Republic declared the [[Moruth Doole]] regime of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] to be illegitimate, the Smugglers' Alliance was cleared to occupy the world; Bettle and Jaxa were responsible for developing preliminary distribution plans for the [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]] market.<ref name=\"JASB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBettle was in many ways rough around the edges. She frequently cursed, and was not above giving a malicious grin or a wicked laugh when her enemies faced setbacks.<ref name=\"Heroes\" /> Although a smuggler, her eyes were not always on the bottom line, especially when her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] was involved; her willingness to run weapons through the blockade strained her long association with her partner,<ref name=\"SWAJ10\" /><ref name=\"SWAJ14\" /> and eventually her father convinced her to become more involved in active rebellion. She sported long [[Hair/Legends|hair]].<ref name=\"Heroes\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nBettle utilized a [[headset comlink]] and wore long-sleeved [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] that was equipped with a [[Belt/Legends|belt]].<ref name=\"Heroes\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBettle first appeared in the premiere of the \"[[Galaxywide NewsNets]]\" feature in [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 3|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 3]], written by [[Paul Sudlow]] and published in [[August]] [[2003]].<ref name=\"SWAJ3\" /> She was first pictured in the [[1995]] supplement to ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'', ''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'', where she was illustrated by [[Robert Duchlinski]].<ref name=\"Heroes\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|5|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|10|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|14|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=Hasty Exit|stext=''Hasty Exit''}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]''\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'' {{1stp}}\n*''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bettle\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]\n[[Category:Smugglers' Alliance members]]"}}}]}}}}
