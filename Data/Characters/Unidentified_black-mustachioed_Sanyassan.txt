He resided in the [[Terak's Keep|Marauders' Stronghold]] with his fellow pirates, under the command of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]]. Together, the Sanyassan Marauders preyed upon the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]], the more peaceful inhabitants of Endor.\n\nBy [[3 ABY/Legends|3.5 ABY]], the moustachioed Sanyassan was assigned to the Stronghold's dungeons, along with an [[Unidentified Sanyassan prison warden|elderly colleague]]. Both were responsible for monitoring [[Prisoner/Legends|detainees]] when the Ewok [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] and his companions came to the rescue of their friend, [[Cindel Towani]], a [[Human/Legends|Human]] female who had been imprisoned at the instruction of King Terak. With the help of a fast-running being known as [[Teek]], the intruders provoked an argument between the wardens, who shot each other with their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] and fell on the ground.\n\n==Biography==\nBy [[96 BBY]], a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Sanyassan]] with [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and a mustache had joined the [[Sanyassan Marauders|Marauders]], a group of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]]. The Marauders traveled<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> from their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], [[Sanyassa IV]],<ref name=\"DBSan\">{{DB|species|marauder|Sanyassan Marauders|archivedate=20100210060753}}</ref> to the [[Endor system/Legends|Endor system]] in a stolen [[Starship/Legends|spacecraft]]. They crash landed on the [[Tree/Legends|forest]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], where many intergalactic travelers had found themselves stranded due to the stellar anomalies surrounding it.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> For many [[Time/Legends|decades]], the Marauders worked together in a military fashion and brought terror to the forest moon's native [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Species/Legends|species]]. Their leader was the self-proclaimed [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]], a brutal [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]].<ref name=\"ISWU\">''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]''</ref>\n\nMany [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later,<ref name=\"TBFE\" /> in [[3 ABY/Legends|3.5 ABY]],<ref name=\"BTM\">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref> the mustachioed individual assisted the elder [[Unidentified Sanyassan prison warden|Marauder prison warden]] in watching Terak's [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]]&mdash;a group of Ewoks and a [[Youngling/Legends|young]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] female named [[Cindel Towani]]. As a way to pass the time during their guard duty, the two Sanyassans played cards, using scraps of metallic objects as chips. Unbeknownst to the card players, a rescue team comprising the Human hermit [[Noa Briqualon]], his companion [[Teek]], and the Ewok [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] got into the castle in hopes of freeing the prisoners.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\n[[File:Marauders_card_players.png|thumb|left|The two Marauders were playing cards when Teek tried to seize the keys.]]\nTeek, who was extremely quick like all members of [[Teek (species)/Legends|his species]], scurried in the warden's direction to get the cell keys from his belt. Teek moved so swiftly that the mustachioed Marauder did not notice what was happening, so the warden and he continued playing. When the old warden won the next game, a card slipped out of his sleeve. The black-moustachioed Marauder was convinced his opponent had cheated, and he rose up to confront him. Things got heated and, in a fit of rage, both individuals drew their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], firing simultaneously. Both were injured and fell to the ground. In fact, it was Teek who had hidden a card in the warden's sleeve to provoke an argument between the two Sanyassans. The mustachioed Sanyassan and his colleague did not get up, which allowed the prisoners to be effectively rescued.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAccording to Cindel Towani's friends Wicket and Noa Briqualon, this card player was one of the meanest-looking and ugliest Marauders they had ever seen.<ref name=\"RWC\">''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]''</ref> He had thick strands of greasy black hair growing from his face, with a cleft chin and an underbite. He also sported a long mustache with vertical extensions grown down the sides of the mouth.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\nThe dark-haired Marauder had a quick temper,<ref name=\"TBFE\" /> a trait shared by most members of his species.<ref name=\"EndorModdell\">{{GamerCite|9|Endor and the Moddell Sector}}</ref> When he suspected his opponent of cheating, he immediately accused him and was ready to fight. When the quarrel developed into a brawl, he faced the warden with his blaster at the ready.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Black-bearded_Marauder_shot.png|thumb|The moustachioed Marauder sustains a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot.]]\nThis Marauder with a black mustache was a minor character in the [[1985]] made-for-TV film ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''.<ref name=\"TBFE\" /> It is known that the two card players were portrayed by [[Michael Pritchard]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller Jr.]], but their roles were only credited as \"Card Player #1\" and \"Card Player #2\".<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\nThe movie is unclear as to whether or not the Sanyassan's blaster wound was fatal. However, the children's book adaptation ''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]'' states that he merely \"collapsed on the floor.\"<ref name=\"RWC\" /> The Sanyassans are known to have tougher hides than [[Human/Legends|Humans]].<ref name=\"EndorModdell\" /> In the movie, the card-playing Marauders spoke [[Sanyassan (language)|their own language]], with no subtitles given,<ref name=\"TBFE\" /> but part of their dialogue was rendered in [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]] in the children's book.<ref name=\"RWC\" />\n\nThe physical appearance of this dark-haired Sanyassan is similar to that of the \"[[Marauder of Endor]]\", a criminal who was featured on a wanted poster in the [[1993]] book ''[[Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas]]''. Both characters share the same black forelocks, \"[[Mushroom/Legends|mushrooms]] lining eyebrows,\" cleft chin, horseshoe mustache and under bite. Furthermore, the unidentified criminal was also described as a \"known associate of Terak\".<ref name=\"MAFGL\">''[[Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas]]''</ref> Even if the \"Marauder of Endor\" was meant to be the card-player, the book in which he appeared was deemed non-[[canon]]ical by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] official [[Leland Chee]], who maintains the [[Holocron continuity database]].<ref name=\"TT1\">{{SWArchive|domain=forums|url=thread.jspa?messageID=14726348&#14726348|text=Leland Chee on ''Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas''|archivedate=20100910101210}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Sanyassans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
