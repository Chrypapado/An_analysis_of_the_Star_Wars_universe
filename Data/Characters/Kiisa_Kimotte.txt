I would not worry yourself over this traitor's fate.|The den mother, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nKiisa Kimotte was the [[den mother]] of the [[Neetha Den]]. The den inhabited a [[Neetha Den's cave|cave]] near the city of [[Nashal]], on the planet Talus of the [[Corellian system]].<ref name=\"SWG:UYT\" /> The [[sept]] [[Kiki Dorente]] served as her advisor.<ref name=\"SWG:TtK\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Talk to Kiki|Talus}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Neetha_den_mother.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The den mother.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], a member of the den proposed a partnership with a group of [[Talusian Smugglers|Talusian smugglers]] based near the cave, the so named Askura deal. However, the deal was fake and the Selonians were soon exploited by the smugglers.<ref name=\"SWG:AtDM\" /> Several Selonians of the den were captured by the smugglers and kept as hostages in order to force the rest of the den into mining for them.<ref name=\"SWG:TtT\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Travel to Talus|Talus}}</ref> The situation generated [[Anti-Humanism|anti-human]] sentiments among the Selonian population of Talus and hostile anti-human demonstrations erupted in the city of Nashal. Despite no act of violence against Humans was reported, the local [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police force]] and the [[Cluster World Relations]] agency issued a travel warning for Nashal. [[Corellia News Service]] thus attempted to contact Kiisa Kimotte to get her to comment on the anti-human demonstrations but the den mother refused to respond to the request.<ref name=\"web\" />\n\n[[File:Selonian_cave_Talus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Neetha Den's cave]].]]\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Corellian Security Force]] was aware of the situation but was unable to intervene in Selonians matters. [[Agent/Legends|Agent]] [[Taarna]] thus recruited an independent spacer in order to help the Seloninans without involving the CorSec.<ref name=\"SWG:TtT\" /> The spacer met Kiki Dorente, advisor to the den mother, and the Seloninans accepted the assistance.<ref name=\"SWG:TtK\" /> The spacer worked with [[Tika Sileste]],<ref name=\"SWG:EaW\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Exploiting a Weakness|Talus}}</ref> [[Ravi Thienta]],<ref name=\"SWG:UYT\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Under Your Thumb\" on Talus</ref> [[Lika Fimente]]<ref name=\"SWG:GtM\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Gather the Missing\" on Talus</ref> and Kiki Dorente in order to develop a strategy against the smugglers.<ref name=\"SWG:FaW\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Finding a Weakness|Talus}}</ref> The spacer then attacked the [[Smuggler Base]] and, although the outsider achieved most of the objectives, the assault was only a partial success. The spacer defeated most of the smugglers, including their leader,<ref name=\"SWG:EaW\" /> and crippled their ability to exploit the Selonians.<ref name=\"SWG:UYT\" /> However, the spacer discovered that the captive Selonians had already been shipped to [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] and sold as [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]]. The spacer also discovered that a traitor in the Selonian den intentionally helped the smugglers.<ref name=\"SWG:GtM\" /> As the situation with the smugglers was solved, the spacer returned to the Selonian cave and was eventually introduced to the den mother. The spacer revealed that the Askura deal was fake and that a member of her Selonian mates betrayed the den. The matriarch promised that the traitor would be punished and rewarded the spacer for the assistance provided. The den mother also awarded the title of den mate to the spacer, a distinction that few non-Selonians received.<ref name=\"SWG:AtDM\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKiisa Kimotte appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:AtDM\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Kiisa Kimotte was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?id=66901&resource=features|text=Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives|archivedate=20111124014132}} {{Mo}} {{1stID|Kiisa Kimotte}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Address the Den Mother}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kimotte, Kiisa}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Selonians]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]"}}}]}}}}
