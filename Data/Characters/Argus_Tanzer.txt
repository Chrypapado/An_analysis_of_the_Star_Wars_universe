The New Republic won't be keen on us just picking some planet and resettling there. There's a ''process''. Not that anyone quite knows what that process ''is''.|Argus Tanzer|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Argus Tanzer''' was a young, [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who served as a [[bureaucrat]] on board the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], a group of [[starship]]s carrying the surviving natives of his [[homeworld]] [[Alderaan]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] [[5 ABY]], Tanzer was part of a meeting on board the flotilla [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' to discuss the future of the flotilla and witnessed the delivery of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]'s remains by the [[New Republic]] to the Alderaanians.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|It's pieces of that damnable Death Star. Isn't it?|Argus Tanzer recognises the Death Star wreckage|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nArgus Tanzer was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] from the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] who survived the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of his [[homeworld]] by the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]].<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]] to [[0 BBY]].</ref> Following the loss of his homeworld, Tanzer at some point joined up with the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], a group of [[starship]]s carrying surviving [[Alderaanian]]s that had been initially established by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and the [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nIn the year [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"date\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Tanzer was serving as a [[bureaucrat]] on the [[flotilla]], which was floating amongst the [[Alderaanian Graveyard|remains]] of Alderaan in the [[Alderaan system]]. He attended a meeting with the [[Regent Administrator]] [[Eglyn Valmor]] on board the Alderaanian [[frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' where they and several other leading members of the flotilla discussed their people's future. Valmor wished to remain in the Alderaan [[Star system|system]], but others like the former [[teacher]] [[Icar Orliss]] and the [[diplomat]] [[Janis Pol]] wished for the surviving Alderaanians to re-settle a new world. When Orliss produced a list of suitable planets they might choose from, Tanzer interjected, arguing that re-settling a new world was not as simple as picking from a list, since they would need to follow the process put in place by the [[New Republic]], although he admitted no one knew what that process was.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThe arguing within the meeting continued until it was interrupted by reports of several large vessels approaching the flotilla. Tanzer and the others were then shocked to see a number of New Republic vessels hauling the remains of the Death Star toward the flotilla, which fellow flotilla member [[Teven Gale]] then revealed he had worked with Organa and Verlaine to acquire for the flotilla as a resource. Valmor and Gale then suggested building a new [[space station]] from the superweapon's remains, although Orliss still remained stubborn on resettling elsewhere.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTanzer was a young man in 5 [[Galactic standard calendar|ABY]], and possessed a natural handsomeness that seemed as though he did not need to cultivate it. While speaking at the meeting he gestured with his hands, thrusting up his [[Limb|finger]] to emphasise a point. He smirked upon realizing the nature of the Death Star wreckage.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nArgus Tanzer first appeared in the novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> and released released on [[July 12]], [[2016]].<ref name=\"Penguin-eBook\">{{Penguin|books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945|Life Debt: Aftermath (Star Wars)|https://web.archive.org/web/20170509143435/http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945}} {{C|eBook}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0435\u0440\n|pl=Argus Tanzer\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tanzer, Argus}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
