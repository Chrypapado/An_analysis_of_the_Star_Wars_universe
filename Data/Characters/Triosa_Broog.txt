And you... are now part of something far more important than your insignificant individual lives. You are now part of an ''Empire''.|Triosa Broog's speech to new cadets at Carida Academy|Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1}}\n'''Triosa Broog''' was a [[human]]<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 1\" /> [[Gender|female]] [[Imperial officer|officer]] who served the [[Galactic Empire]] on [[Carida]].<ref name=\"Expanded\" /> By [[10 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]'' dates [[Han Solo]]'s expulsion from the [[Imperial Academy]] on [[Carida]] in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' to nine years after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the formation of the Empire to [[19 BBY]], therefore Han Solo must have been expelled in [[10 BBY]]. Triosa Broog served as [[Sergeant]] at the [[Carida Academy]] one week prior to Solo's expulsion, meaning [[Gender|she]] must have achieved that [[Military rank|rank]] by 10 BBY.</ref> she had achieved the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[sergeant]] and was stationed at the Carida Academy, where she served as [[training officer]] to [[Cadet]] [[Han Solo]]. Solo proved to be a disobedient cadet and his reckless flight behavior and repeated insubordination drew the ire of Broog's [[commanding officer]], [[Captain]] [[Nettic Whain]]. Whain questioned Broog on why Solo had not been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy|academy]] when other cadets were kicked out for less. Broog pointed to Solo's exemplary flight record, explaining that she had never seen anyone with his reaction time or innovative problem-solving skills when [[pilot]]ing a [[Starship|ship]]. Whain countered that he would rather have one hundred recruits who follow orders than the best pilot in [[the galaxy]] who does not. She implored the captain to give Solo one more chance, declaring she believed she could get him to follow orders. After realizing just how impressive Solo's flight skills were, Whain relented, on the condition that she take away his flight privileges for a week&mdash;if Solo improved he could be reinstated and if he did not, he would be expelled and sent [[Mimban|somewhere]] a [[soldier]] who didn't follow orders could be useful.<ref name=\"Expanded\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition'' audiobook]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 1|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 1]] {{1stp}}\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 1]]\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 2|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 2]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Han Solo (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Han Solo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30b5\u30fb\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b0\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broog, Triosa}}\n[[Category:Carida residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
