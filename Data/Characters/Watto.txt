He was the owner of [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]] as well as her son, [[Anakin Skywalker]], the young [[Youngling|boy]] who would grow up to become both a revered [[Jedi Knight]] and a feared [[Sith Lord]] known as [[Darth]] Vader.\n\n==Biography==\n===Fall of the Republic===\nWatto started [[Gender|his]] life as a [[soldier]] on [[Toydaria]]. However, he left Toydaria after he suffered an injury and went to [[Tatooine]], where he watched [[Jawa]]s sell used goods and decided to start his own business.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Qui-Gon_mind_trick.png|thumb|left|250px|Qui-Gon Jinn attempting to negotiate with Watto]]\nWatto became a [[junk dealer]] living in [[Mos Espa]] where he owned a small [[Watto's junkshop|shop]]. Watto won two [[Slavery|slaves]], [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]] and her son [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]], from [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] the [[Hutt]] in a bet. Watto discovered Anakin's natural [[podracing]] abilities and began to sponsor the boy in several Podraces. Despite this, Watto often bet against Anakin.<ref name=\"tpm\" /> Watto would also host podracing viewing parties for his gambling partners and friends in his [[Watto's box|private box]].<ref name=\"Ultimate SW\" /> Aside from maintaining the droids at his shop, Watto also had Anakin polish parts of them.<ref name=\"AgR Anakin\">[[Age of Republic - Anakin Skywalker 1|''Age of Republic - Anakin Skywalker'' 1]]</ref>\n\nIn [[32 BBY]], the [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] came to his store looking for parts for his ship. Qui-Gon didn't have enough money and was unable to negotiate a price with Watto, even failing to perform a [[mind trick]] on the [[Toydarian]].<ref name=\"tpm\" />\n\n[[File:Wattomocks.png|thumb|right|250px|Watto observing the Boonta Eve podracing event]]\nThe next [[Standard day|day]], Qui-Gon told Watto that he wanted to enter Anakin in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] in exchange for parts for his ship. Watto agreed and entered Anakin but Watto bet on the [[Dug]] [[racer]] [[Sebulba]]. Qui-Gon placed a bet for Anakin's freedom despite Watto's warnings that Anakin was going to lose anyway. Anakin, however, won the race and left Tatooine with Qui-Gon to become a [[Jedi]] on [[Coruscant]] while Shmi remained with Watto.<ref name=\"tpm\" />\n\nYears later, Watto sold Shmi to the [[moisture farmer]] [[Cliegg Lars]], who bought her to live with him on his [[Lars Homestead|moisture farm]].<ref name=\"aotc\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars:'' Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Four years after the Invasion of Naboo, Senator Amidala sent her handmaiden Sabe to track down Shmi and free as many slaves as she could. Sabe was unsuccessful in tracking down Watto or Shmi, being forced to instead waste time dealing with Watto's associates.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref> During all these years, Watto continued with his faithful trade and even bought adjacent buildings to enlarge his shop, but he started to suffer great losses on gambling, leaving the future of his business unsure, aside from that he had no longer the necessary personnel and was forced to do all the hard work himself.<ref name=\"Complete Locations 2016\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref>\n\n[[File:Watto-old.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Watto shortly before the Clone Wars]]\nIn [[22 BBY]], shortly before the [[First Battle of Geonosis|beginning]] of the [[Clone Wars]], Anakin returned to Tatooine in search of his mother. Watto, after recognizing his former slave, asked him if he could help with some \"deadbeats\" who owed him a lot of money. After being asked about Shmi, Watto gave him all of the information he knew about Shmi after selling her.<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n\n===Age of the Empire===\nDuring his [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on Tatooine after [[Order 66]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] purchased a humidifier from Watto at an inflated price. After Kenobi was [[Rescue of Princess Leia|killed]] by [[Darth]] Vader on the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], Kenobi found himself in a vision of his [[Ben Kenobi's home|hut]] on Tatooine. He noted that the humidifier was not in the vision, among other recent additions that were missing. He then realized the vision was of an earlier time in his hut, from around three years into his exile.<ref name=\"Time\">{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|Outlanders. They think we know nothing.|Watto|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nWatto was proud of his business and distrusting of [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[credit]]s, which he felt weren't \"real\" enough for the tough economy of an [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim Territory]] [[planet]] like Tatooine. When Qui-Gon Jinn attempted a mind trick on him in order to get him to accept 20,000 credits in exchange for a [[T-14 hyperdrive generator]], he shrugged it off, telling Jinn that as a Toydarian, mind tricks didn't work on him. Watto was a heavy gambler, and later lost the hyperdrive and Anakin in a bet he had wagered against the Jedi.<ref name=\"tpm\" /> After Anakin's departure, he started to suffer heavy losses on gambling.<ref name=\"Complete Locations 2016\" />\n\nAs the owner of Shmi and Anakin Skywalker, Watto was particularly not a kind master, even though the living conditions of the Skywalkers were more agreeable in comparison to their life in servitude to Gardulla the Hutt. However, Watto sometimes showed flashes of compassion: he allowed Anakin to go home early if he finished all his assigned tasks and Shmi to perform certain quieter duties at the comfort of her private work station.<ref name=\"Skywalker: A Family at War\">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref>\n\nWatto's underestimation of Anakin proved to be a heavy blow to his business. Once Anakin left Tatooine and after he sold Shmi to the [[Lars family]], Watto found himself with no help and was forced to do the hard job himself so his business could survive. Ill-used to the huge capabilities of his former slave, Watto wasn't able to find anymore servants with the sufficient technical knowledge.<ref name=\"Complete Locations 2016\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Watto-SWE.png|thumb|right|170px|Watto as seen in ''The Phantom Menace'']]\nWatto was portrayed and voiced by actor [[Andrew Secombe]] in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] and its [[2002]] sequel [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']].<ref name=\"tpm\" /><ref name=\"aotc\" /> Secombe played Watto on set, to give animators a reference for lighting and eye-line.<ref name=\"e1ig\">''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]''</ref>\n\nConceived by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]], Watto's design was more avian in nature, featuring plumage and a beak. Later incarnations of the Toydarian featured a cigar and tentacles.<ref name=\"db\">{{DB|location|wattosshop|Watto's shop|archivedate=20100203092509}}</ref> When artist [[Terryl Whitlatch]] began designing the character, she began with an ugly, \"cherub-like\" design. Lucas suggested that he be given webbed, duck-like feet.<ref name=\"e1ig\" /> Eventually, the basis for the character's face was derived from an early concept painting of the [[Neimoidian]] race by concept artist [[Doug Chiang]], particularly the hooked trunk and the crooked teeth. As the character spoke frequently, animator [[Rob Coleman]] found lip-syncing Watto's lines with Secombe's delivery of the dialog to be difficult. To solve the issue, Coleman had part of Watto's teeth chipped away, so the character could speak out the side of his mouth, making the syncing process much easier. Sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] recorded himself opening and closing an umbrella to make the sound of Watto's wings flapping.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=6|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: Podracer's Rescue]]}}\n*''[[Queen's Peril]]''\n*[[Queen's Peril (audiobook)|''Queen's Peril'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{1st}}\n*[[The Phantom Menace (Golden Book)|''The Phantom Menace'' Golden Book]]\n*''[[The Phantom Menace Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Journeys: The Phantom Menace]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Journeys: Beginnings]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*''[[Queen's Shadow]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Queen's Shadow (audiobook)|''Queen's Shadow'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Obi-Wan & Anakin Adventure]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]\n*[[Age of Republic - Anakin Skywalker 1|''Age of Republic - Anakin Skywalker'' 1]] {{Flash}}\n*{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Age of Rebellion - Darth Vader 1|''Age of Rebellion - Darth Vader'' 1]] {{Flash}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}} {{Mo}}\n*[[From a Certain Point of View (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!
