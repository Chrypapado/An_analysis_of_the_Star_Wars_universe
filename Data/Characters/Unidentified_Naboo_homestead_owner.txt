Follow me, I have something to show you.|The homestead owner, to Gavyn Sykes|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nA '''Human male''' owned a homestead on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] countryside at the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]]<ref name=\"SW:BFN\" /> in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]].<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Early during the invasion, the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] launched an [[Skirmishes in the Naboo countryside|attack]] on [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo civilians]] to quell any potential uprisings. The [[Human/Legends|Human's]] homestead was in the way of the advancing [[B1-Series battle droid|battle droids]]. [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]], an [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]], was in the area at the same time.<ref name=\"SW:BFN\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nLieutenant Sykes used [[Gender/Legends|his]] [[Seraph-class urban landspeeder|Flash speeder]] to destroy the first wave of [[Battle droid/Legends|droids]], after which the man ran out from his house to his [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]]. A second wave of [[Droid/Legends|droids]] pursued the man's [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]], but Sykes drove them off. In gratitude, the individual asked the [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] to follow him. Leading Sykes to his nearby [[Farm/Legends|farm]], the homestead owner gave the pilot technology useful to the [[Naboo Resistance]]. The homestead owner subsequently hid in his [[Armor/Legends|armored]] barn.<ref name=\"SW:BFN\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nThe light-skinned owner was [[Clothing/Legends|wearing]] a [[Color/Legends|blue]] tunic with black [[Boot/Legends|boots]] during the encounter.<ref name=\"SW:BFN\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe homestead owner appears in a side-quest in the [[2000]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]''. Saving him from attacking droids allows the player to find a vehicle upgrade and fulfill a bonus objective by picking up the upgrade. He uses the same sprite as the other Human characters in the game.<ref name=\"SW:BFN\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
