Trigit was a lean [[Human/Legends|Human]] who, in his later [[Standard year/Legends|years]], sported a graying black beard and matching [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and a black and silver uniform that he designed himself.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" /> The surname \"Trigit\" was common amongst Human colonies.{{Fact}}\n\n==Biography==\nTrigit's history prior to his departure from the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Starfleet]] in [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]] is unknown. After [[Ysanne Isard]]'s supposed [[Death/Legends|death]], Trigit went rogue along with his [[Starship/Legends|ship]] and crew. Trigit then hired himself and his [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]], [[Implacable (Imperial-class)|''Implacable'']], to Zsinj. There he bore the title of \"admiral\", although given the number of self-promoted warlords, his penchant for individualism and his command of a single starship, it is unlikely that this was the rank he held within the Imperial Starfleet.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n\nTrigit leaked intelligence to [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] agents and drew [[Talon Squadron (New Republic)|Talon Squadron]] into a trap that reduced their squadron to a single [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]]. Filled with hubris, Trigit initiated the [[Battle of Folor]] but the newly formed [[Wraith Squadron]] based there, having discovered ''Implacable''{{'s}} docking at [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]], was able to avoid destruction. Trigit managed to avoid a New Republic trap at [[Morobe system|Morobe]] that claimed ''[[Provocateur]]'' and ''[[Constrictor]]''.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n\nAt the behest of Zsinj, Trigit ordered ''Implacable'' to [[Ession]] to receive a shipment of [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighters]] from the [[Pakkerd Light Transport]] facility. [[Ession Strike|''Night Caller'']], an Imperial corvette under the control of disguised Wraith Squadron commandos, escorted ''Implacable''. This time, Trigit would not avoid the trap. Wraith Squadron sprung its surprise and engaged ''Implacable''. Falynn Sandskimmer immobilized the ship by destroying its power cells, which caused Trigit to initiate the self-destruct sequence and flee the Star Destroyer in a modified [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE/IN interceptor]]. Chased by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Edor Crespin]] and [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Myn Donos]], Trigit refused to surrender. Crespin destroyed the admiral's escort, and Donos, the sole survivor of Talon Squadron, correctly predicted Trigit's path and destroyed his fighter with a pair of [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedoes]].<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'' {{C|ANT8, ''Wedge Antilles''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Apwar Trigit\n|ru=\u0410\u043f\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u0422\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trigit, Apwar}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Zsinj's empire]]"}}}]}}}}
