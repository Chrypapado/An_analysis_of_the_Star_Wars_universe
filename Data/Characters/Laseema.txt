Soon though, she took an interest in [[Atin Skirata|Atin]]. It is not known for certain if she continued working in Qibbu's Hut but it seems likely that, after [[Kal Skirata]] rented her an [[Laseema's apartment|apartment]], she would have left her old job. During this time she was still very wary of unexpected visitors, prompting Kal to advise [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Bardan Jusik]] to call ahead before arriving.\n\nWhen Jedi Knight [[Etain Tur-Mukan]] gave birth to [[Venku Skirata]], she acted as the baby's caretaker along with [[Besany Wennen]] and Jusik. She quit her job at Qibbu's and worked as a waitress in the [[Kragget]], the cantina located below her apartment. Though in no need of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], she insisted on earning her keep.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], she married Atin via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]. After the battle she along with Kal's [[Clan Skirata|clan]] moved to Kal's home in [[Kyrimorut]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Mandalore/Legends|Mandalore]], where she attended Etain's [[Funeral of Etain Tur-Mukan|funeral]]. Being a waitress, and the only one with experience in preparing food, Laseema took charge of the clan's kitchen, taking on the major task of feeding at least twenty individuals at a time.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Republic Commando: True Colors]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel]]''\n*''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Laseema\n|pl=Laseema\n|ru=\u041b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Clan Skirata]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Rutian Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
