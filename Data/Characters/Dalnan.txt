A Dalnan delegation, including [[Ambassador]] [[Weft]], his son [[Honesty Weft|Honesty]], and [[Janex]], boarded the [[cruiser]] ''[[Steady Wing]]'' to attend the dedication ceremony of the [[Starlight Beacon]] [[space station]]. The Dalnans practiced a coming-of-age ritual called [[Metamorphosis Trials]], which were intended to test their children on the skills required for their chosen life paths.<ref name=\"A Test of Courage\">''[[The High Republic: A Test of Courage]]''</ref> If a child did not undergo these trials, they were not considered to be adults in Dalnan society's eyes.<ref name=\"A Test of Courage\" />\n\nDalnans were a rather isolationist culture who did not like space travel and thus rarely left their homeworld, though they were not unwelcoming towards those who visited their planet. This aversion to space travel increased as a result of the [[Great Hyperspace Disaster]] and repeated attacks in the Dalna sector by the [[Nihil]] pirates. They lived a largely peaceful lifestyle based around farming and agriculture, but also maintained a warrior lifestyle as a result of a civil war a century prior to the Disaster, with many Dalnans choosing to learn combat skills on the off-chance another war happened or to fend off pirate attacks.<ref name=\"A Test of Courage\" />\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The High Republic: A Test of Courage]]'' {{1st|[[The High Republic: A Test of Courage (audiobook)|''The High Republic: A Test of Courage'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[The High Republic: A Test of Courage (audiobook)|''The High Republic: A Test of Courage'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The High Republic: Out of the Shadows]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The High Republic: Out of the Shadows (audiobook)|''The High Republic: Out of the Shadows'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Dalnans| ]]\n[[Category:Planetary cultural groups]]"}}}]}}}}
