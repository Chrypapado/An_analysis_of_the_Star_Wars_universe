During the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the Talons entered themselves in the [[Cularin Classic]] [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop race]], and Windrunner hired the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] investigator [[Di'hal'uma]] to look into the backgrounds of the other teams participating in the race. He traveled to meet with Di'hal'uma in the [[Dancing Flame Tavern]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Gadrin]], but when he arrived, the Twi'lek was not there, and he learned that a group of thugs had attempted to capture her. Windrunner returned to [[Landing Bay 216]], the Talons' base of operations, and spoke to the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who were investigating the attack on Di'hal'uma.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Cloak and Vibroblade]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Windrunner, Seng}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swoop gang leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
