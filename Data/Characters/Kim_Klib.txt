His day job was as a messenger and stockboy for one of the local emporiums, but on the side he was an underworld [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]]. He was developing contacts in the underworld of Gadrin and [[Hedrett]]. He enjoyed stealing and stole from his employer, but was overconfident in his abilities. He tended to wear patched jumpsuits, and tried to be unobtrusive at the emporium, where his employer's wife treated him like dirt.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klib, Kim}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
