Near the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], she had been overwhelmed with the horrors of war and left on a [[Meditation/Legends|meditative]] retreat. It was for this reason she escaped the execution of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] and the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. After learning of the fall of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], Elaiza went into hiding on her homeworld of Nar Shaddaa, also called the Smugglers' Moon. There she hid from the Empire and its [[Jedi Hunter]]s among the teeming masses of life crowding the moon.\n\nAt some time during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Elaiza's aging [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] began to fail and a new [[lightsaber crystal]] was required to repair it. She traveled to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] to participate in an auction for the [[Jewel of Yavin]], a valuable [[Corusca gem/Legends|corusca gem]] she planned to cut down to create a new crystal for her Jedi weapon.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Jewel of Yavin]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Edge of the Empire'' Core Rulebook]] {{Po}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi]]"}}}]}}}}
