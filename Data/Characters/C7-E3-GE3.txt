At one time [[C6-E3-GE3]] had been in charge of directing the other droids in the warehouse, until he was replaced with by C7-E3. Much to C6's dismay, C6 was re-assigned to assist C7 instead, and C7's arrogant and condescending nature infuriated him. C6-E3 attempted several times to convince his owners that the C7 unit should be shipped to maintenance, but as Vogga had little concern over the details of how the warehouse was ran, his requests were ignored.\n\nWhen [[T3-M4]] infiltrated the warehouse, the droid C7-E3 reassigned him to C6-E3. T3 attempted to convince him to let him go further into the warehouse but C7-E3 threatened to give T3 a [[Memory wipe/Legends|memory wipe]] and make him undergo behavioral reprogramming. When T3 discovered the hostility between the two protocol droids, he offered a way for C6 to regain his old position if he would then grant him access to the secured areas. C6-E3 agreed, and when T3 destroyed the C7 unit C6 took over his old position until it too was destroyed.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn cut content, if the player allowed the right conditions for [[B-4D4-GE3]] to escape Czerka, he and [[T1-N1]] were meant to reach Nar Shaddaa and find employment in Vogga the Hutt's warehouse. The duo took the place of C7-E3 guarding the door that lead to Vogga's transponder codes, and after T3-M4 commented on T1-N1's height he would go berserk and would be destroyed in the ensuing battle.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=C7-E3-GE3\n|fr=C7-E3-GE3\n}}\n\n[[Category:GE3-series protocol droids]]\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
