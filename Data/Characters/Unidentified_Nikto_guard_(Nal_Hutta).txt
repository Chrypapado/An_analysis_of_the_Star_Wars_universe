If you do not answer my questions about your two partners...we will not be so hospitable.|Obi-Wan Kenobi speaking to the guard|Friends and Enemies}}\nThis [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]] was a [[Gender|male]] '''[[Nikto]] guard''' working for the [[Hutt]] crime lords on the [[planet]] [[Nal Hutta]] during the [[Clone Wars]] around [[21 BBY]]. The guard captured the [[Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], disguised as [[Rako Hardeen]], and tortured Kenobi for information about his [[Moralo Eval|two]] [[Cad Bane|partners]]. They eventually struck a deal where Kenobi would reveal a tracking frequency code he had made sure was efficient, and in exchange Kenobi would be released. After the code was given up, it was told to [[Unidentified Nikto pilot|another enforcer]] who was soon able to shoot down the [[starship]] containing Bane and Eval. On an inquiry of why Kenobi was still prisoner, the guard revealed that he had decided the deal would be off, and kept Kenobi incapacitated. In response, the disguised Jedi released himself unbeknownst to the guard, and soon rendered the Hutt enforcer unconscious.<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis guard first appeared in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' television series]] episode, [[Friends and Enemies]], which was released in [[2012]].<ref name=\"Season Four\">{{TCW|The Clone Wars: Season Four}}</ref> He was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Hutt enforcers]]\n[[Category:Kajain'sa'Nikto]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]\n[[Category:Torturers and interrogators]]\n[[Category:Unidentified criminals]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
