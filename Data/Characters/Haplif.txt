Why would I settle for one dead when I can have all of them?|Haplif, to [[Qilori]] of Uandualon|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\n'''Haplif''' was a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[Gender|male]] [[Agbui]] who served the [[Grysk Hegemony]] operative [[Jixtus]]. Haplif possessed a talent for reading and analyzing cultures, which he proudly utilized in service to his employer. Under orders from Jixtus, Haplif instigated a [[Sunrise civil war|tragic civil war]] on a [[planet]] that came to be known as \"[[Sunrise]].\" Thereafter, Haplif attempted to [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|orchestrate the demise]] of the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] by sparking a civil war between three of its [[Great Families|Forty Great Families]].\n\nDuring his plot against the [[Chiss]], Haplif stayed with [[Farmer|rancher]] [[Xodlak'phr'ooa]] \"Lakphro\" on the Ascendancy planet [[Celwis]] for several [[standard month|months]]. The Agbui attempted to [[Death|kill]] his host before departing, but the rancher defeated Haplif and killed his erstwhile guest in self-defense.\n\n==Biography==\n===Destroying a world for nyix===\n{{Quote|If you're looking to spread blame, remember that you're the one who pushed those flat-blast artillery shells onto both sides.|Shimkif reminding Haplif of munitions he pushed on the population of Sunrise, which caused Frosif trauma|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nAt the behest of Jixtus, Haplif orchestrated a [[Sunrise civil war|civil war]] on the [[planet]] [[Sunrise]] in under six [[standard month|months]]. During the civil war,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> which took place around [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"GG Date\" /><ref name=\"civil war date\">[[The Magys]] and her refugees arrived at [[Rapacc]] seven and a half months before the main events of ''Greater Good'', which was placed at three months prior to the events of ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising|Chaos Rising]]'', so the civil war on Sunrise must have been ongoing around 19 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]].</ref> Haplif pushed both sides to use destructive [[flat-blast artillery shell]]s, which would later cause [[Frosif]] to be triggered into a trauma response to similar sounds. Haplif's war left most of the [[the Magys species|native population]] [[death|dead]] and ravaged the sky and surface of the planet. The Agbui and the Grysk Hegemony subsequently took over Sunrise and [[Mining|mined]] the world for [[nyix]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nA group of two hundred [[refugee]]s, led by [[the Magys]], escaped their planet, heading towards the [[Paccosh]] homeworld of [[Rapacc]]. Unlike many of the worlds of the [[Unknown Regions|Chaos]] populated by sentient species, Sunrise never had a long-range [[communications triad]]. Jixtus had told Haplif to leave no witnesses. However, Haplif had neither military forces at his disposal nor a comms triad on Sunrise, so he could neither kill the refugees nor contact Jixtus to have them killed. Instead, he contacted the forces of the [[Nikardun Destiny]], giving them the refugees' vector and telling them that the refugees were raising an army against the Nikardun. Thereafter, the [[Nikardun military]] came to occupy and subjugate the [[Rapacc system]], where the refugees settled a [[Unidentified city (Rapacc)|city]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n===Subverting the Chiss===\nAfter successfully orchestrating the destruction of Sunrise, Haplif's master Jixtus sent the Agbui to infiltrate, learn about, and ultimately try to destroy the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] from within.  To prepare, Haplif and a number of other Agbui including [[Shimkif]] and [[Frosif]] posed as cultural nomads traveling the Chaos in order to learn about the Ascendancy.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nIn doing so, Haplif came to travel with the [[Chiss]] midager [[Coduyo'po'nekri]] ([[core name]] \"Yoponek\"), whom he manipulated into organizing a meeting with [[Councilor (Chiss Ascendancy)|Councilor]] [[Xodlak'uvi'vil]] (\"Lakuviv\") on the Chiss Ascendancy planet [[Celwis]]. While residing on Celwis on [[farm]]land owned by [[Farmer|Rancher]] [[Xodlak'phr'ooa]] (\"Lakphro\"), Haplif influenced Lakuviv into believing that the Agbui possessed a valuable [[nyix]] [[Unidentified settlement (Agbui)|mining settlement]]. By flooding the market of Celwis with underpriced [[nyix brooch]]es and acting naive about the metal's value, Haplif and his companions manipulated Councilor Lakuviv into attempting to secure the mine for the [[Xodlak family]]. At the same time, two other Chiss families were manipulated into claiming the supposed mine.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThough the resulting conflict threatened to grow into the civil war that Haplif had intended, [[Senior Captain]]s [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] and [[Irizi'in'daro]] of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]] managed to put a stop to it by destroying the false mine. Haplif never learned that his plan had failed, however. Just as Haplif his Agbui companions prepared to leave Celwis, Lakphro confronted him; having realized that his guest was up to something. Haplif attempted to kill the rancher, but Lakphro managed to defend himself, killing his former guest who was left for dead by his fellow Agbui.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Never let it be said that Haplif of the Agbui lacks confidence and pride.|Jixtus|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nHaplif was supremely confident, even arrogant, about his abilities. He hated leaving any job uncompleted, even if all that remained was \"mop-up.\" While Haplif enjoyed causing mass-scale destruction, he disliked killing others with his hands as his telepathic sense of touch would cause him strong unpleasant feelings while killing someone.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nHaplif often presented a fa\u00e7ade of good humor and cheer, although he secretly thought many of the individuals he interacted were stupid, boring or spoiled. While Haplif had a strong desire to finish his [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|task]] so he could return to an unspecified home, he found satisfaction while dying in his belief that the plot against the Chiss would come to fruition.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nHaplif and other Agbui had a limited form of [[telepathy]], based on physically touching other [[sentience|sentient]] beings. Haplif claimed to be particularly gifted with that ability, which he insisted allowed him to understand, manipulate, and even destroy entire species. Haplif took pride in using his knowledge of others' desires and motivations to manipulate them. He likened such knowledge to having a \"handle\" belonging to an [[ax]] which he could weaponize for his own goals.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nBecause of Haplif's exceptional interpersonal skills including manipulation, Jixtus put Haplif in charge of interacting with Chiss and learning about Chiss culture, out of the fifty Agbui \"cultural nomads\" in Haplif's traveling group. While Shimkif also possessed touch-based telepathy, she was more skilled than Haplif in administration but less skilled at manipulating people. Therefore, she was put in charge of keeping the Agbui starship and crew in working order while Haplif was tasked with manipulating Chiss.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHaplif of the Agbui first appeared in the [[2021]] novel ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' by [[Timothy Zahn]], in which he played the role of the primary [[Wikipedia:antagonist|antagonist]] and a major point-of-view character.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Haplif's role in ''Greater Good'' was similar to the role played by Pathfinder [[navigator]] [[Qilori]] of [[Uandualon]] in that novel's [[2020]] prequel, ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'', although Haplif was much more involved in Jixtus' machinations than Qilori was in [[Nikardun conquests|those]] of [[Yiv]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ka=\u10f0\u10d0\u10de\u10da\u10d8\u10e4\u10d8\n}}\n\n[[Category:Agbui]]\n[[Category:Celwis residents]]\n[[Category:Grysk Hegemony individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
