The merchant then gave Kenobi his thermal detonator as a reward and advised him to use it on the Federation [[Armored Assault Tank]] that was blocking the way to the [[Theed Hangar/Legends|hangar]] housing the [[Queen/Legends|queen's]] [[Starship/Legends|ship]].

During this time, he heard the news that Amidala had supposedly been [[Death/Legends|killed]] offworld by agents of the Federation, and he was saddened by the loss of his queen.

The merchant informed Amidala of his earlier encounter with Kenobi and provided the queen with a stash of stockpiled weapons, including a [[proton missile launcher]] and ten [[flash-bang grenade]]s. As Amidala turned to leave, he wished her luck in the liberation of the planet, which soon proved successful.<ref name=\"TPM game\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Oh, help me!

At first, Kenobi did not believe his story and suspected that the man may have lied and could actually be a criminal. Even after Kenobi had released him, the merchant still continued to insist on his innocence, claiming that he should be viewed as a hero and urging Kenobi to \"[[Force sense/Legends|sense]] the truth.\"<ref name=\"TPM game\" />\n\nHowever, by giving Queen Amidala his stockpiled weapons, the merchant proved that he was at least truthful about working toward the liberation of Naboo.

While imprisoned, he was able to keep a thermal detonator on him, which he later gave to Kenobi as a reward. After being liberated, the man began stockpiling weapons to fight the Trade Federation, amassing an arsenal that included at least ten flash-bang [[Grenade/Legends|grenades]] and a [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton]] [[Missile launcher/Legends|missile launcher]].

The individual can first be encountered as a non-playable character in the fifth level of the game, titled \"Escape from Theed,\" in which the player controls Obi-Wan Kenobi. Since the encounter does not affect the game's storyline, the meeting with the merchant can be avoided entirely. If the merchant is encountered, the player can either leave him inside his cell or release him. In the latter scenario, it is also possible to kill the man right afterward.<ref name=\"TPM game\" />\n\nUnless the prisoner has been killed by Kenobi, the player&mdash;this time controlling Queen Amidala&mdash;can once again encounter him in the tenth level, titled \"Assault on Theed.\" If Kenobi did not encounter him previously or chose to keep him locked up, then the prisoner will still be located inside his cell. Amidala will then have the same options available to her, and she can either ignore his pleas and leave him imprisoned, can release and then kill him, or she can release him and let him live. However, if the prisoner has already been released by Kenobi, then Amidala will encounter him on a balcony outside his cell, and he will provide her with weapons. This article currently follows the latter version of events.<ref name=\"TPM game\" />\n\nDue to a glitch in the game, if Amidala releases the merchant, lets him run to his waiting spot at the balcony, and then kills him, a new version of the merchant will respawn right next to his dead body. This copy will then act out the dialogue corresponding to the scenario in which he was released by Kenobi.<ref name=\"TPM game\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of unidentified Naboo merchant|imagecat=Images of unidentified Naboo merchant}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
