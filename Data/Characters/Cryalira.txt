She was surprised when the previous Irstat-Kes, [[Meirana]], died shortly after the previous Mother did, making her Irstat-Kes instead of [[Dariana]]. She would have preferred roaming the jungle to her duties leading the irstat.<ref name=\"cg\" />\n\nShe had difficulty making decisions for the tribe, believing that she had not been trained nor had talent for the role; but she was still growing into her position, and many believe she would made an excellent Irstat-Kes with time. Certain discontent elements of the irstat were conspiring against her in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]].<ref name=\"cg\" />\n\nCryalira had the tendency to raise her crest when presiding, leading many to believe she was always angry.<ref name=\"cg\" />\n\nHer known relatives included her grandson, [[Fisonna]].<ref name=\"cg\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Holes]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Padawannabes]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Heads of government and state]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
