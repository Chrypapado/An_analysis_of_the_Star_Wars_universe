The three captains were [[Gelesi]], [[Riiken]], and [[Bostuco]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIt is possible that Anda only talks to Surik if the player decides to support Vaklu instead of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]]. If so, Surik convinces Gelesi to step down by reminding him of possible harm to his wife and children, she slices a terminal near the [[Sky Ramp]], causing a power surge that kills Bostuco, and arranges to have Riiken dishonorably discharged. Surik could also kill Riiken when he is patrolling near the cantina. However Surik must do this when she and Riiken are alone.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Anda\n|fr=Anda\n|pl=Anda\n|ru=\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
