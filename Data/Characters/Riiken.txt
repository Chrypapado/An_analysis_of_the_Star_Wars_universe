He was one of the [[Captain of the Guard/Legends|Captains of the Guard]] placed in charge of maintaining order within the walled [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz's]] [[Merchant Quarter]]. He was assisted in the investigation of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]]'s [[Death/Legends|murder]] by the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]]. Later, he supported the [[Onderon Royalist|Royalist]] faction backing [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] while Vaklu's forces wished to depose her and secede from the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government. Riiken was [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] for his loyalties during the attempted coup, but he was later freed by Surik, who helped to resolve the conflict. After the resolution of the brief war, he was promoted to [[Major/Legends|major]] and sent to command reinforcements during a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Battle of Telos IV|attack]] on [[Telos IV]]'s [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]], [[Citadel Station]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Question a superior officer, and they call that 'disrespecting the rank.' Do that too many times and it's not long before you're a civilian.|Riiken, on the strict hierarchy of the Onderonian military|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nRiiken was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] serving in the [[Onderonian military|military]] of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], for some [[Time/Legends|time]] prior to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]]'s efforts to overthrow the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] monarch, [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]],<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"kotorcg\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> As a [[Captain of the Guard/Legends|Captain of the Guard]] placed in charge of maintaining order within the [[Merchant Quarter]] of the walled [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], Riiken remained loyal to Talia's regime despite his [[Troop/Legends|troops]]' sympathy for the General and former resistance fighter against the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] occupation.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n[[File:Iziz.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Riiken served as part of the military in the city of Iziz on Onderon.]]\n===The Onderon Civil War===\nDuring the unrest of the [[Onderon Civil War]], Captain [[Sullio]] of the Onderon Military was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] in the streets of Iziz, and Riiken was placed in charge of the investigation. Soon, [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Dhagon Ghent]], a friend of Sullio, was arrested as a suspect after Riiken had heard eyewitness accounts of a fight between the two fellows. Later, a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]],<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> [[Meetra Surik]],<ref name=\"Note\">The character of the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]], the protagonist of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', was later confirmed to have been known as Meetra Surik in the novel ''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''.</ref> accompanied by [[Canderous Ordo|Mandalore the Preserver]], the [[Mandalore (title)|leader]] of the Mandalorians, visited Onderon. Riiken was approached by them, and informed Surik of the doctor's arrest as well as giving her general information on his homeworld in addition to snippets of its history. When she and Ghent's friend, [[Nikko]], were able to gather the evidence needed to exonerate the physician, those were presented to the Captain. Riiken watched a recording from the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[S-0D3-GE3]], one that proved the murderer had come from the Merchant Quarter, which conflicted with eyewitness reports that placed Ghent in his office at the time, on the opposite end of the plaza. Their exchange was interrupted, however, when a [[Unidentified Onderonian major|major]] attempted to remove Riiken from the case; Surik then turned to the newcomer and presented the same evidence, forcing him to fold. Ghent was swiftly set free.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nIn the wake of this incident and a number of fights in the western part of the Merchant Quarter, Riiken chose to relocate his post, intent on patrolling the sector more effectively, hoping to prevent further violence; as it happened, that was Sullio's former posting.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n====The Second Battle of Onderon====\nThough Riiken was loyal to the current monarch, many of the troops under his command were Vaklu supporters. His loyalty to Talia, who embraced the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and urged peaceful cooperation, would lead directly to his [[Prison/Legends|imprisonment]] during the [[Second Battle of Onderon (Onderon Civil War)|Second Battle of Onderon]]. Riiken was freed by Surik when she penetrated the [[Iziz Royal Palace]] in an effort to forestall Vaklu's attempt at a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]-aided coup d'etat. Joining with Surik and the other [[Onderon Royalist|Royalists]], Riiken took a decisive role in the battle by giving her the security code needed to open the door leading to the Queen's throne room. After the battle ended, Riiken was promoted to the rank of [[Major/Legends|major]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==== The Battle of Telos====\nSome time later, he was sent to planet [[Telos IV]] in command of an emergency relief force which consisted of a [[Platoon/Legends|platoon]] of Onderonian troops, during the [[Battle of Telos IV|Sith invasion]] of the planet's [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] [[Citadel Station|habitation satellite]]. There, he once again encountered Surik, who led the charge to repel the invading [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] from the [[Space station/Legends|station]] with the assistance of Riiken's detachment.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Talia_Render.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Riiken was one of the soldiers loyal to Talia, the ruler of Onderon.]]\n{{Quote|Thanks for clearing this whole thing up, I could tell that justice wasn't being served. But we all have our orders. We really need to patrol that sector better.|Riiken thanks Surik for her help in resolving the case of Sullio's murder|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nRiiken was a bald, dark-skinned man with [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and a brown-[[Hair/Legends|haired]] beard. A competent [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] and leader, Riiken was a good-natured pragmatist who took his duty seriously. During his service, he learned that a long-term career required one to do his or her job and not question the system. Although he often harbored doubts about the basic ability of higher-ups within the military, he was careful to keep his thoughts to himself or, in the case of Meetra Surik, anyone whom he considered trustworthy. Riiken was devoted to his homeworld and its people, and thus did not shy away from danger to ensure that the peace was kept; that included his loyalty to Queen Talia, who was seen by many as the sort of leader one could trust. He was also a skilled investigator, as he was put in charge of the investigation into the death of Sullio, a fellow military [[Officer/Legends|officer]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nBeyond his duties as a soldier, Riiken loved to collect stories about Onderon's history, including the [[Beast Wars]] and how they came to happen, as well as pointing out interesting tidbits of information to curious tourists. He did not often get the chance to relate his tales, and he was always happy to do so when the opportunity presented itself.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nRiiken wore the standard Onderonian military officer's [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]]. During combat, he used a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRiiken was created for ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', a [[video game]] of [[Obsidian Entertainment]], first released in late [[2004]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> In the game, he was voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].<ref name=\"imdb\">{{Imdb|name/nm0482851|Phil LaMarr}} lists \"Captain Riiken\" under LaMarr's characters for his ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords'' credit. Although IMDb is not generally taken as an authoritative source on Wookieepedia, the actor's own [http://www.phillamarr.com/about/ official website] points visitors to his \"Full credit list on IMDb\" rather than listing a CV. Therefore, per this endorsement from the performer's own publicity site, the IMDb credit is taken as valid.</ref> Riiken's appearance overlaps with one of the possible choices for a male Jedi Exile, the player character. Therefore, if the player chooses the Exile to look like him, Riiken's appearance will change accordingly. However, since the Exile is canonically female, his standard appearance is canon.<ref name=\"prima\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAside from supporting Talia's faction, which is considered the [[canon]]ical flow of events, there are other paths the player can take in the game. At the request of a Vaklu supporter named [[Anda]], the Exile can remove the three Captains of the Guard in order to weaken the Royalist military in preparation for the attack on the Royal Palace. Anda is willing to pay the Exile {{Cr}}2,500 for each one she removes. If the Exile supports Vaklu during her initial visit to Onderon, she has the option of having Riiken dishonorably discharged for not being loyal to his [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officer]], either through means of normal persuasion or by [[Mind trick|using the Force]] to persuade him. He can also be killed while he is patrolling the Merchant Quadrant alone. Subsequently, Riiken will not make an appearance at the Battle of Telos IV.<ref name=\"prima\" />\n\nIf Riiken appears on Citadel Station during the Battle of Telos IV, it is possible for him to engage in combat with the Sith forces in the Module, even though he is not equipped with a weapon. This will only occur if all of the unidentified members of the [[Khoonda Militia]] are killed by the wave of Sith forces, and the player retreats back into Citadel Station's [[Citadel Station Ithorian Compound|Ithorian Compound]], leading the Sith forces into it as well. Riiken could also be killed by these Sith, assuming that the weapons they have equipped are strong enough.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Appearances ==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Riiken\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderon Royalists]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
