He was opposed to Naboo's full intergration into the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and was supported in his campaign by [[Cosinga Palpatine]], ostensibly to protect Naboo's [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] reserves from being exploited by corporate entities. Cosinga's [[Palpatine/Legends|son]], however, regarded it as a crude, transparent attempt to grab power, as his father was engaging in an extramarital affair with the man's [[Cosinga Palpatine's mistress|sister]]. The younger Palpatine leaked details of the opponent's plans to Tapalo's camp, ultimately drawing [[Damask Holdings/Legends|Damask Holdings]] to Naboo and destroying the campaign, and resulting in Tapalo's election as King of Naboo.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{1st|[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Oponente de Bon Tapalo\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tapalo, Bon}}\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
