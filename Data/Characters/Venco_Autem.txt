He was the older brother of [[Sagoro Autem|Sagoro]], and like him, was a [[Senate Guard/Legends|Senate Guard]].\n\n==Biography==\nVenco was corrupt, and took bribes; for this he was arrested by his own brother, expelled from the Guard, and sent to a prison world. There, he caught a terminal disease that was incurable by [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] or any other medical technology. He also experienced a new purpose of sorts: deciding that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] was corrupt beyond all repair, he wanted to try and assure its demise before he died.\n\nIn [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], Sagoro was assigned to investigate the assassination of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Jheramahd Greyshade]] while the successor, [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]], was placed under the protection of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]. His investigation would eventually implicate his brother in the crime.\n\nVenco then used his nephew [[Reymet Autem|Reymet's]] na\u00efvet\u00e9 to get his hands on Sagoro's Senate access code. With these codes, Venco entered the Senate for one final assassination attempt against the new Senator Greyshade.\n\nAs soon as Venco was implicated in the plot, Sagoro was taken off the case as the investigation turned towards the Autem family. Sagoro's commitment to protecting his charge, however, never wavered. Defying orders, Sagoro was there when Venco fired his shot. Greyshade lived, but Sagoro was forced to kill his brother, effectively eliminating his one chance to clear his involvement in the crimes.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Republic 47|''Republic'' 47]] {{1st}}\n*[[Republic 48|''Republic'' 48]]\n*''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|sagoroautem|Autem, Sagoro|archivedate=20100830071222}}\n*{{DB|character|vencoautem|Autem, Venco|archivedate=20100209205659}}\n*{{SW|url=news/viva-space-vegas-the-history-of-the-marvelous-wheel-part-2|text=Viva Space Vegas!
