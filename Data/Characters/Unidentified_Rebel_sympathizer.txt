He worked on [[Aleq Armond]]'s enhanced [[Ion drive|ion engine]] project which was intended to improve the speed of the Empire's [[TIE Series|TIE fighters]]. The student served as a spy for the Rebel Alliance and informed them that, if the public demonstration of the new ion engine system were to fail, the project was bound to be abandoned.\n\nIn order to protect the student from harm, the Alliance dispatched a team of operatives who sabotaged the demonstration, causing the new ion engine engine not to be implemented.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis character appears in an adventure idea in ''[[Into the Core Worlds]]'' and, while the character remains unidentified, it is obviously significant in an in-universe perspective, playing a pivotal role in the development of TIE fighter technology.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|7|Into the Core Worlds}} {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Agents of the Rebel Alliance]]\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Rebel Alliance personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
