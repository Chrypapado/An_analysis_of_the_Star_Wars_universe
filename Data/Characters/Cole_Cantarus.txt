At the age of sixteen, he was sent to a juvenile detention center where he turned his life around. Two years later, he was enlisted with [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] - the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] police force - where he used his knowledge of the streets to compile an amazing arrest record.\n\nAs a reward, Cole was transferred to the CorSec unit assigned to protect the members of the [[Corellian Council]], where he was eventually promoted to [[Captain/Legends|captain]]. When the government handed [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] over to the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Empire]], the betrayal hit Cole particularly hard. But while a lesser man might have fallen into despair, Cole channeled his rage into a more productive path and helped organize the Corellian rebellion.\n\nWhen the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] launched a counter-offensive to [[Battle of Corellia|reclaim]] the planet, Cantarus and a [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] rebel [[Gosse]] got captured by the Empire and imprisoned in an Imperial-held CorSec station in the nearby [[Entertainment Plaza]], when a Republic hero stormed the building and rescued them. Reuniting with [[General/Legends|General]] [[Aves (general)|Aves]] at the [[Gilded Descent Casino/Legends|Gilded Descent Casino]], he and Cantarus were contacted by Councilor [[Belos]], one of the Council members who had helped the Empire in the invasion. Belos claimed to have had a change of heart, but Cantarus refused to forgive his actions that led to the occupation.\n\n{{GameLS}}\nCantarus relocated to his former workstation - the Council Guardhouse in the [[Governmental Sector|Government District]], where he was informed by Belos that the Empire had a surprise in store for the Republic: the [[Ion Wall]]. Belos alerted Cantarus to the location of the Ion Wall's emitters at the [[Intra-Corellian Intelligence]] and Cantarus send the Republic hero to destroy the emitters. As the Republic launched a final offensive to reclaim the Legislature building, Cantarus joined the hero in confronting [[Darth Hadra]]. After her defeat, Cantarus asserted CorSec's authority to arrest every surviving Council, Belos included. However, the Republic hero chose to let Belos go free, to Cantarus' disapproval. After the defeat of [[Darth Decimus]], General Aves and Cantarus congratulated the Republic hero with the victory on Corellia.<ref name=\"Government Clearance\">{{TORcite|type=faction|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]|Government Clearance|[[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]}}</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\nRetaking his homeworld would not be the end of war for Cantarus, as he directly participated in the [[Battle of Ilum]] that followed. After [[Darth Malgus]] broke away from the Empire, Cantarus flew a Republic strike team to [[Fort Barrow]] where they reclaimed [[Darth Serevin]]'s stealth shuttle with coordinates for the [[Emperor's Fortress]]. Surviving the dogfight against Serevin himself, Cantarus piloted the stolen shuttle to the space station, where the Republic strike team defeated Malgus.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0443\u043b \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cantarus, Cole}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
