When [[Meetra Surik]] arrived on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Gonlo, Jubei, and Saquesh were all killed when Saquesh refused Surik's request to leave the refugees that he oversaw alone.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the Exile chooses to have the refugee [[Adana (Human)|Adana]] sold into slavery without convincing her mother, [[Nadaa]], to sell herself with her, then she can lie to Saquesh by telling him that the refugees are planning a rescue. He orders Gonlo to have Adana taken away from the refugee sector and sold. ([[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark side]] path)\n\nIf the Exile has a high enough persuasion, she can convince Saquesh to give the refugees more space by claiming that one of the refugees, [[Geriel]], has a contagious ilness. This is a bluff, since in fact the Exile cures Geriel. In this instance, neither Gonlo, Jubei or Saquesh are killed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Weequays]]"}}}]}}}}
