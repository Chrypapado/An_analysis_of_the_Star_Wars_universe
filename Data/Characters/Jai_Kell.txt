And ready to see the galaxy. You?|Zare Leonis and Jai Kell|Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks}}\n'''Jai Kell''' was a [[human]] [[Imperial cadet|cadet]] at the [[Academy for Young Imperials]] on [[Lothal]] fifteen years after the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], thought to be [[Force-sensitive]] by [[Cumberlayne Aresko|Commander Aresko]] and [[Myles Grint|Taskmaster Grint]]. He was known to have a [[Jai Kell's mother|mother]], who also lived on Lothal. During his time at the Imperial Academy, he was a member of [[Unit Aurek]] which was part of squad [[LRC077]]. Kell had an amicable relationship with [[Zare Leonis]] and [[Pandak Symes]] but did not get along with [[Nazhros Oleg]].\n\nLater, Unit Aurek was joined by Dev Morgan, who was actually the [[Force-sensitive]] rebel and [[Jedi|Jedi-in-training]] [[Ezra Bridger]]. Bridger was on a mission to steal a [[decoder]] from Imperial Headquarters which contained the location of a [[kyber crystal]] shipment. Kell and Morgan attracted the attention of [[the Grand Inquisitor]], who ran a secret program known as [[Project Harvester]] which identified Force-sensitive individuals. After Bridger learned that the Inquisitor was coming, he and Leonis persuaded a reluctant Kell to escape the Imperial Academy. The [[Spectres]] then arranged for Kell and his mother to go into hiding.\n\nFour [[Standard year|years]] later, Jai, now a member of [[Ryder Azadi]]'s [[Lothal resistance group]], encountered the Spectres once again. They had been sent to Lothal by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] leader [[Mon Mothma]] in response to a message from Ryder about a [[TIE/D Defender Elite|new TIE Defender]] the Empire was developing on the planet. Jai helped Bridger and [[Sabine Wren]] avoid detection and arrest, and later helped the Spectres escape the occupied [[Jhothal]] through its sewer system. He later helped recover the [[hyperdrive]] of the stolen TIE/D Defender Elite prototype, and assisted in destroying the air defenses placed to defend the [[Imperial Armory Complex]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Orientation===\n[[File:Lothal_Full_Planet.png|thumb|left|200px|Jai Kell grew up on the planet Lothal]]\n{{Quote|Right. Finest ration-squares on Lothal. What I wouldn't give for a couple of maize rolls with genuine Westhills butter.|Jai Kell joking about the rigors of Academy life|Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks}}\nJai Kell was born and raised on the planet [[Lothal]] during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]]. During his childhood, he and his family visited [[Pretor Flats]] one winter and regarded it as a beautiful place. While he still had a [[Jai Kell's mother|mother]], Kell's father had died two years before he had enrolled at the [[Academy for Young Imperials]] in Lothal's [[Capital City]]. The Academy for Young Imperials was a junior one-year academy that prepared [[Imperial cadet]]s for training at more specialized senior academies which prepared cadets for a career with the [[Stormtrooper]]s, the [[Imperial Army]], and the [[Imperial Navy]] respectively. Jai joined the Empire with the hope of seeing the wider [[galaxy]] and reaching a top rank in the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nDuring his time at the Imperial Academy, Jai was assigned to [[Unit Aurek]], a four-member cell within the cadet squad [[LRC077]]. He befriended his fellow Aurek members [[Zare Leonis]] and [[Pandak Symes]]. However, Jai had an acrimonious relationship with [[Nazhros Oleg]], who was disliked by the other cadets for being selfish and a bully. Unknown to Jai or the other cadets, Leonis was a rebel sympathizer who had infiltrated the Academy to find his missing sister [[Dhara Leonis]], who had disappeared during a field exercise the previous year. Throughout their two-week orientation, Jai and his fellow cadets participated in frequent running drills and field exercises under the supervision of [[Sergeant]] [[Currahee]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Chiron]]. Like his fellow cadets, Jai regarded Currahee as a \"witch\" because of her fiery temper and even nicknamed her \"Curry.\" Jai also thought that Lieutenant Chiron was \"inhuman\" due to his incredible running stamina.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nOne night, while their fellow cadet Symes was sleeping, Jai caught Oleg \"borrowing\" Symes' [[chance cube]] from his footlocker. When Oleg alleged that Symes had gained the cube by cheating during a game, Jai responded that Symes was not a cheater; prompting Oleg to return the stolen cube. Jai then turned to chat with Leonis about their personal backgrounds. After learning that Leonis was a recent migrant who had been born offworld, Jai asked Oleg where he had come from. Oleg revealed that he had come from the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] colony world of [[Eufornis Minor]], and added that his ambition was to make it to a senior academy so that he did not have to return to Lothal again, which he dismissed as a \"dirtball.\" Cool-minded, Jai did not take insult at his homeworld being disparaged and instead commented that the seniors would have to wait.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nThe following morning, Jai and his fellow cadets were woken up by Sergeant Currahee, who did a footlocker inspection. The tough-minded Currahee found infractions with the entire Unit Aurek and reprimanded Kell and Leonis for leaving dirt on their boots. As punishment, she issued all the cadets in the unit three demerits each. Later that day, Jai's fellow cadet Symes found himself falling behind the other cadets and was regularly berated by Sergeant Currahee. When Leonis attempted to help Symes, Jai tried to advise him that he couldn't since it was not his responsibility.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nAs the Orientation period progressed, Jai and his fellow cadets were issued with helmets and [[E-11 blaster rifle]]s, standard [[Imperial Military]] equipment. Near the end of the orientation phase, Jai and his fellow Unit Aurek cadets took part in a training exercise which involved the cadets deploying from a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] into a lake. After disembarking, Jai and the rest of Unit Aurek had to reassemble their rifles before embarking on an obstacle course to reach a pre-set destination. While navigating through the obstacle course, the cadets had to avoid being hit by trainers with their [[blaster]]s set on [[stun]] mode.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nFor the obstacle course, Jai and Symes elected Leonis as their leader, overruling Oleg, who had coveted that position for himself. Under Leonis' leadership, Unit Aurek proceeded forward in wedge formation with Jai and Oleg flanking Leonis on the right. The four cadets also worked together to knock out a trainer, with Jai and Oleg distracting him so that Leonis could sting him with his blaster. Learning that the trainers held the high ground, Leonis ordered his fellow unit members to switch to file formation. This tactic work and Unit Aurek succeeded in achieving their objective. However, Symes experienced a nervous breakdown and Leonis attempted to help him. Shortly later, the exercise ended, which marked an end to the orientation phase. While Symes decided to withdraw from the Academy, Jai, along with Leonis and Oleg, decided to continue their training.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\n===Surviving the Well===\n{{Quote|We're learning to become officers in the Empire's service. Out for a stroll on the beautiful planet Lothal, remember? But think about how hard that first week was, Zare. Now, we strip down E-11s, run ten klicks, and practice tactical formations before breakfast.|Kell talking about Academy life|Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks}}\n[[File:Breaking_Ranks_thumb.png|thumb|right|250px|Nazhros Oleg, Jai Kell (third from the right), Zare Leonis, and Ezra Bridger in the Well]]\nAfter surviving the orientation phase, Jai and his fellow cadets quickly adjusted to the rhythm of Academy life. He and his fellow Unit Aurek members were jubilant when Sergeant Currahee failed to find any infractions during an inspection drill. For the rest of the term, Jai and the rest of squad LRC077 underwent a series of grueling physical assessments which were designed to test the cadets' physical prowess, mental acuity, leadership skills, and strategic adaptability. Most of these assessments took place in [[the Well]], a purpose-built facility in the Academy that could be remotely configured to simulate a wide variety of obstacle courses.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nFor their first assessment, the Well was configured into a deep pit with a large retractable device known as [[the Pillar]] in the center. Under [[Commandant]] [[Cumberlayne Aresko]]'s orders, the cadets were ordered to attach their harnesses to rings hanging out on the Pillar. After the Pillar rose carrying the cadets with it, Jai and his fellow cadets were ordered to climb down. While descending, Jai and the other cadets also had to ride over a series of floating [[repulsorlift]] platforms that detached themselves from the wall of the pit.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nTaking a risky maneuver, Jai unlocked his carbiner and jumped down two meters, landing on a platform. He managed to reattach his harness to a nearby ring before the platform beneath him began to retract. Jai was one of the first three cadets to reach the bottom, coming in third place to Cadets [[de Grom]] and [[Wheeler]]. As a reward, he and the other winners were given an extra dessert ration and a free period. To encourage competition, Commandant Aresko announced that future top three finishers would be rewarded with weekend passes and work details at Imperial headquarters.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nDuring the second assessment, Jai and his fellow cadets had to climb up the Pillar while navigating retracting platforms. This time, Jai worked in a team with Zare to reach the top. Despite their efforts, Oleg managed to beat them to the top of the Pillar while pushing down another cadet named [[Lomus]]. While this training assessment appeared to reward selfishness, it was designed to simulate the competing priorities that Imperial officers would have to face when trying to complete a mission. During a third exercise conducted by Sergeant Currahee, Jai was again paired together with Leonis. This exercise involved firing an old [[Clone Wars]]-era projectile launcher at targets. This time, the two cadets succeeded in completing their objective by striking a target with a direct hit.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\n===Enter \"Dev Morgan\"===\n{{Quote|Quite a finish, cadets. It seems this trial was too easy. Morgan, Kell, you both set course records.|Cumbarlayne Aresko takes an interest in Jai Kell and Dev Morgan|Breaking Ranks}}\n[[File:Breaking_Ranks.png|thumb|left|275px|Leonis, Kell (center), and Bridger]]\nJai Kell befriended [[Ezra Bridger|Dev Morgan]], a transfer cadet from [[Pretor Flats Academy]], who had been sent to replace Pandak Symes. While Kell quickly took a liking to the newcomer's good sense of humor, Leonis was suspicious of Morgan and disliked his braggadocio. Meanwhile, Oleg despised the newcomer for being a \"[[moisture farmer]]\" who was out of place in the big city. Despite being a newcomer, Morgan excelled in the assessments and seemed to be in the right place at the right time.<ref name=\"RitR\" /> Unknown to Kell and the other cadets, Morgan was actually Ezra Bridger, an undercover rebel and [[Jedi|Jedi-in-training]] who had been sent by his [[Spectres|rebel cell]] to steal a [[decoder]] containing the coordinates for a [[kyber crystal]] shipment. Nonetheless, they became firm friends in the short time they knew each other.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nAs the term progressed, Kell and his fellow cadets embarked on a week of training assessments under the supervision of Commandant Aresko, who would decide which academies they would go to continue their training the following year.<ref name=\"RitR\" /> During the first training session, Unit Aurek and [[Unit Besh]] were tasked with using floating repulsorlift platforms to climb out of the Well. During the assessment, Kell noticed that Morgan had an [[Force-sensitive|uncanny ability]] to anticipate the platforms before they appeared. After a challenging exercise, Morgan, Kell, and Leonis were the first three candidates to emerge from the Well. Morgan and Kell's success during the exercise caught the attention of Commandant Aresko, who praised the two cadets for setting course records. As a reward, the three cadets were given work details at the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]] in Capital City.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nWhile Jai was working at the Imperial Complex, Leonis caught Morgan attempting to remove the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]]' decoder from his office. Instead of reporting him, Leonis saved Morgan by warning him not to take it out through the door since it would cause the place to go into lockdown. After discussing their motives for resisting the Empire, Leonis and Morgan made an agreement to steal the decoder. To get back into Imperial Headquarters, the two cadets made an agreement to win the next assessment in the Well.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\n[[File:Jai_Kell.png|thumb|right|200px|Jai Kell during his academy years]]\nAs a result of this secret agreement, Kell's relationship with Morgan would be tested during the next training assessment. This time, the cadets had to use their blasters to activate the repulsorlift platforms in order to race to the top. To guarantee Leonis a spot in the top three places, Morgan sabotaged Kell by shoving him from a repulsorlift platform, causing him to fall to the bottom of the Well. Due to his efforts to befriend Morgan, Jai was angered by what he perceived as competitive backstabbing. He was further hurt when Commandant Aresko used Morgan's example to teach the cadets that there was no friendship in war and that the only thing that mattered was victory. When he confronted his former friend, Morgan merely explained that he did what he had to do; though Bridger was genuinely remorseful, he was forced to do so in order to complete his mission. Jai sadly responded, \"Good to know.\"<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\n===Escaping the Academy===\n{{Quote|You were supposed to be on the walker with us. Now what?''\"<br>\"''Stick to the plan. I'll figure out a way to get on board.|Jai and Dev discussing their escape plan|Breaking Ranks}}\n[[File:The_Grand_Inquisitor_and_Zare_Leonis.png|thumb|left|300px|The Grand Inquisitor, who was interested in Kell's Force powers]]\nMorgan's apparent \"backstabbing\" of Jai Kell during the assessment enabled him and Leonis to carry out their plan to steal the decoder from Agent Kallus' office. While Leonis distracted Kallus with a fake procurement order, Bridger crawled into a ventilation shaft above the ISB agent's office and used the Force to levitate the decoder into his hands. An opportunity for Morgan to make amends with Kell surfaced when the rebel infiltrator overheard a conversation between Commandant Aresko and [[the Grand Inquisitor]], a high-ranking [[Dark side of the Force|Dark Side]] agent of the Empire tasked with hunting down [[Great Jedi Purge]] survivors and recruiting prospective [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]]. Aresko had identified Morgan and Kell as two cadets who fitted the Grand Inquisitor's \"special criteria.\" The Grand Inquisitor informed Aresko that he would be visiting the Academy the following to inspect these cadets, and to take them into custody if they indeed met his requirements.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nRealizing that Kell was Force-sensitive, Morgan informed Leonis. Unwilling to allow Kell to meet the same fate as his sister Dhara, Leonis and Morgan agreed that they had to warn Jai before it was too late. After passing the decoder to Morgan's rebel colleagues, the two cadets awoke Kell from his sleep that night and brought him to the storeroom lair. Due to Morgan's recent backstabbing, Kell was initially unwilling to believe his and Leonis' story, and thought that they were trying to get him \"busted\" from the Academy. He also questioned the Inquisitor's existence and even welcomed the idea of the Inquisitor training him, not knowing of the fate that would befall him.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nLeonis managed to win over Jai after he recounted how his sister Dhara had disappeared under similar circumstances a year ago. Since Jai's only family was his mother, he realized that he would never be able to see her again if the Inquisitor took him away, nor would she ever know why he had disappeared. Realizing that he was in danger, Jai agreed to cooperate with Morgan and Leonis. The three cadets then devised a plan to escape from the Academy by winning the next challenge in the Well. Since Commandant Aresko had announced that the top three cadets would be allowed to ride an [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walker]], Dev devised an escape plan which involved using the walker to escape the Academy.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nThe following day, the three rebellious cadets proceeded with their plan. However, their plan encountered an unexpected setback when Oleg fired on Jai and Dev took the shot for him, saving Jai at the cost of his own spot in the top three. Jai and Leonis managed to win the challenge along with Oleg. Despite Jai's misgivings, Dev told him to \"stick to the plan.\" While riding in the AT-DP walker, Kell and Leonis heard an explosion outside. This was Jai's signal to stun the walker's driver with the blaster he had been given. He then stunned Oleg when he tried to intervene. Leonis then took control of the walker and attempted to reach the bay doors, but came under attack from an [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]]. After being rejoined by Morgan, the three cadets managed to breach the Academy's gates.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nUpon exiting the blast doors, Kell and Leonis were met by Morgan's rebel associates [[Garazeb Orrelios]] and [[Sabine Wren]]. While Jai and Morgan escaped with the rebels on a [[landspeeder]], Leonis decided to stay behind to find his sister. To cover his involvement, Leonis pretend to shoot at the landspeeder. After escaping Capital City, Jai and his rebel rescuers fled to the plains of Lothal, where they rejoined the other crew of the ''[[Ghost]]'', a modified [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which served as the main base of the Spectres. The rebel cell's leader, [[Hera Syndulla]], agreed to help Jai and his mother hide from the Empire, though Jai seemed pessimistic about their chances of success.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\n===Lothal resistance===\n[[File:TheOccupation-RebelsS04E05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kell helping the Spectres escape into Capital City's sewers]]\n====Reunion with the Spectres====\nSometime during the next four [[Standard year|years]], Jai joined the [[Lothal resistance group]], led by former governor [[Ryder Azadi]]. During this time, the Empire began building and developing [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter]]s on Lothal, under the supervision of [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]. Eventually, an even more advanced model of Defender, the [[TIE/D Defender Elite|Elite]], was developed. By this time, Lothal was in a tight lockdown, but Ryder sent a message to [[Alliance High Command]] on [[Yavin 4]] about the fighter. Shortly after, [[Jho]], a member of the Lothal resistance, was captured during an Imperial [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|raid]], and executed shortly thereafter. Ryder sent Jai to the [[Old Jho's Pit Stop|Pit Stop]], the [[cantina]] formerly owned by Jho, to wait for the Spectres to arrive, as they were familiar with the place and unaware of the changed circumstances. When Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren, disguised as civilians, entered the now-Imperial-owned bar, Jai was present.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\nHe realized who they were when Bridger mentioned to the cantina's new owner, [[Baron]] [[Valen Rudor]], that he had patronized the place when it was still owned by Jho. When Bridger and Sabine were nearly detained by stormtroopers when they attempted to leave, Jai stepped in to extricate them, calling Bridger \"Oleg\" as a hint to his identity. Bridger did not immediately recognize Jai, as it had been years since they had seen each other. When the rebels' attempt to escape from [[Jhothal]] in a landspeeder was thwarted, Jai led them to an entrance to the town's sewers, which Jho had kept up as an escape route. After a chase by stormtroopers, the rebels found their way to the correct exit, where they were met by Ryder and escaped in his [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]].<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\n====The TIE Defender Elite====\n[[File:Rukh_vs_Ezra_and_Jai.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jai (far right) and Ezra Bridger fleeing Rukh]]\nJai later helped search for Bridger and Sabine, after they went missing after stealing the prototype TIE Defender Elite.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref> Shortly after, Jai was sent with Bridger and Zeb to help retrieve the Defender Elite's [[hyperdrive]], which Bridger and Sabine had hidden in the rocks near the prototype's crash site. He and Bridger were disguised as [[scout trooper]]s. Shortly after Bridger and Zeb found the hyperdrive, Thrawn's [[assassin]], [[Rukh]], arrived in the area to assist in the search for the Rebels, and immediately smelled the [[Lasat]] Zeb. He also smelled that Zeb was not alone, and set off for the Rebels' position. Jai, on watch, alerted Bridger and Zeb to the assassin's approach. While Zeb dealt with the hyperdrive, Bridger attempted to stall Rukh.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\nWith Jai as backup, Bridger attempted to persuade Rukh that the two were genuine scout troopers who had just finished searching the area. Due to the [[Noghri]]'s excellent sense of smell, this did not work, and a fight ensued. Bridger exposed himself as a Jedi when he used the Force to throw Rukh off Jai, shortly before the two escaped on a [[speeder bike]]. They were pursued by Rukh and two scout troopers. Meanwhile, Zeb, having evaded the Imperials, stole a troop transport in order to escape and return to the Rebel camp. Jai and Bridger were pursued by Rukh and the troopers through a maze of rock spires.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\nDuring the chase, Rukh managed to plant a [[homing beacon]] on Jai and Bridger's bike without them noticing. Thus, when the two escaped, Rukh was able to report the Rebel camp's position to [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] after the Rebels reached it. When the Imperials attacked the camp, Sabine had just finished installing the hyperdrive on Ryder's U-wing, and Hera and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] were quickly able to escape Lothal with the Elite's stolen [[flight data recorder]]. Jai escaped the camp in a landspeeder loaded down with crates, promising to make contact with the others later.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\n====Hera's strike on Lothal====\nLater, Jai was present at the Lothal rebels' new base in the southern hemisphere.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref> When Alliance High Command approved an [[Attack on Lothal|attack]] on the planet's [[Imperial Armory Complex]], Jai assisted Ryder and the Spectres in planting explosives on turrets installed as anti-air defenses to cover the factory complex. He, along with the others, saw the Rebel fighters sent on the attack be shot down by a second wave of Imperial fighters over Lothal City, before they were forced to return to their base.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>\n\n====Kanan's death====\nFollowing Hera's failed air strike and capture, Jai along with Ryder and [[Mart Mattin]] watched as the Spectres Bridger, Sabine, Zeb, and Chopper assembled three [[Loth-bat glider]]s for their [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|mission to rescue]] Hera Syndulla. Despite rescuing Hera, Kanan was killed when Governor Arihnda Pryce bombarded the [[Lothal City fuel depot]].<ref name=\"Jedi Night\">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref> Later, Jai along with Ryder and Mart were listening to a [[propaganda]] broadcast by [[Alton Kastle]] claiming that the rebel cause on Lothal was lost. However, the Spectres subsequently discovered that Kanan had not died in vain and that the explosion had knocked out Thrawn's TIE Defender factor.<ref name=\"DUME\">{{Rebels|DUME}}</ref>\n\n====Trapping Governor Pryce====\nJai Kell later participated in Bridger and Ryder Azadi's plan to lure Governor Pryce into a trap at the Lothal cliff dwelling. This was the first step in Bridger's plan to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal from Imperial rule. As part of the plan, Ryder pretended to betray the rebels and revealed their coordinates to Governor Pryce in return for escaping imprisonment.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the assault, Jai and Mart Mattin sensed movement on the outskirts of the camp. Shortly later, Governor Pryce assaulted the camp with a fleet of [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transports]], [[Jumptrooper|jump troopers]], and stormtroopers. The Imperials eventually cornered the rebel defenders on top of the Mining Guild ore crawler. Despite being overwhelmed and captured by Imperial forces, the rebels were relieved by Hera's reinforcements and a pack of loth-wolves. As a result, the Imperials were defeated and Governor Pryce captured.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" /> Soon afterwards, a strike team of rebels lead by Bridger managed to infiltrate the Imperial Complex, ultimately destroying it and [[Liberation of Lothal|liberating]] Lothal. However, in order to save his fellow rebels, Bridger had summoned a group of [[purrgil]], which defeated Lothal's [[7th Fleet|Imperial blockade]] and took him, Grand [[Admiral]] Thrawn, and the ''[[Chimaera]]'s'' crew into [[hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Well, the seniors will have to wait.

He had a good sense of humor and tended to avoid getting embroiled in arguments. When another cadet, Nazhros Oleg, described his homeworld Lothal as a \"dirtball,\" Kell merely changed the topic and went to bed. Kell also coped with the harsh training regiment at the Academy for Young Imperials by finding things to poke fun at. On one occasion, he joked that the drill sergeant Currahee lived on blaster gas and molten [[carbonite]]. Physically fit and agile, Kell was also Force-sensitive but was unaware of this fact until his encounter with Dev Morgan.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\nA loyal Imperial citizen, Jai had joined the Academy with the hope of becoming an Imperial Military officer. He also wanted to see [[the galaxy]], and admired the Galactic Empire for rebuilding civilization and defeating the Separatists. Jai also regarded the Empire as a positive force in the galaxy which stopped corruption and made the galaxy a safe place by fighting [[Slavery|slavers]] and [[pirate]]s. In addition, he welcomed the employment opportunities that the Empire had brought to his homeworld of Lothal. While Kell was initially disbelieving of Zare Leonis and Dev Morgan's reports about the Grand Inquisitor, he came to accept their arguments after Leonis recounted his sister Dhara's disappearance under suspicious circumstances. Jai was also very fond of his mother, since his father had died sometime prior, and it was realizing that he would never see her again that made him agree to escape the Academy.<ref name=\"RitR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJai Kell first appeared as a supporting character in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episode \"[[Breaking Ranks]],\" which was released on [[October 27]], [[2014]]. His backstory and character development was later expanded in [[Jason Fry]]'s [[Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks|''Rebel in the Ranks'']], the second book in the [[Star Wars Rebels: Servants of the Empire|''Servants of the Empire'']] young adult novel series that was published as a supplement to ''Star Wars Rebels''.
