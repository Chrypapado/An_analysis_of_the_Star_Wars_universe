Upon delivery she was also to receive a mnemonic aid, \"Restore Republic honor to the galaxy\". When the mnemonic aid was decoded and entered into the ''Stellar Envoy's'' navigational computer, she would have been able to travel to [[Tandun III]] completing her mission. However, Folee never got to perform her mission. After a run in with Republic forces, Jadak and Reeze were forced to detour to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], where Reeze died, Jadak was put in a sixty-year-long coma, and the ''Stellar Envoy'' was lost.\n\nA [[Standard year/Legends|year]] later, Aren Folee and the Rangers met with [[Jax Pavan]], [[Laranth Tarak]], [[Den Dhur]], and [[I-5YQ]] when they made a stop on [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{1stm|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[The Last Jedi (novel)|''The Last Jedi'']] {{1st}} {{1stID|Aren}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Folee\n|ja=\u30d5\u30a9\u30ea\u30fc\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Folee, Aren}}\n[[Category:Antarian Rangers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Toprawans]]"}}}]}}}}
