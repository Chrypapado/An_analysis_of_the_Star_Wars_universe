By the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], their civilization was considered primitive by [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] more progressive inhabitants, and they did not use [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] and other complicated technology despite the fact that they did commerce with other [[Planet/Legends|planets]]&mdash;the [[Satab (individual)|Satab]] called a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44 heavy blaster pistol]] an \"odd weapon that spits fire.\" Also, their [[Mineral/Legends|mineral]]-based culture was quite distinct from the galactic norm, with much of their commerce, and even their religion (a title in whose church was a [[Rov]]), was based on what they extracted from various [[Mining/Legends|excavations]]. The ruling [[Satab]] also controlled the trafficking of [[Sansanna spice/Legends|sansanna]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]], which was added to food in the palace. Pethaps the most important feature of Ventooinan society, at least until some time prior to [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], was the [[shadeshine]], a stone with unique properties that served as the Satab regalia. Ventooinans utilized beasts of burden as mounts and harness animals.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars Annual (1977) 2|''Star Wars Annual'' (1977) 2]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Human and Near-Human species]]\n[[Category:Outer Rim Territories species]]\n[[Category:Ventooinians| ]]"}}}]}}}}
