Gara had an understanding with the [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]]-based [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Yustavan Dreezian]] whereby Dreezian transported shipments of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] aboard [[Starship/Legends|starships]] that were operated by Gara's company. However, the pair eventually fell out and Gara refused to allow his ships to transport any more goods for Dreezian, so the crime [[Lord/Legends|lord]] hired the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] [[Kodi Vilthar]] to [[Death/Legends|murder]] Gara. Vilthar carried out his assigned and he destroyed a [[Realspace/Legends|space]] [[Transport/Legends|transport]] that Gara was traveling aboard, which killed the Corellian. In the aftermath of the industrialist's death, Gara's daughter&mdash;[[Magda Gara]]&mdash;hired a group of [[Agent/Legends|agents]] to capture Vilthar, to made the assassin face justice for causing her father's demise.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gara, Cilyn}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
