She was given the choice of a [[Prison/Legends|prison]] sentence or off-[[Planet/Legends|world]] indentured labor. She chose to enlist in the militia of [[Dorvalla/Legends|Dorvalla]], an [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] world. It was on that world that she developed an affectation for [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]] fashions and a taste for luxury.\n\nWhen she finished her tour, she returned to her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and volunteered for the [[Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps/Legends|Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps]], eventually becoming a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. Sometime later, she became a protege of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who arranged for her to be appointed [[Portmaster]].\n\nVerbon's administrative style was simple: total loyalty in exchange for \"bonuses.\" She profited from the judicious use of a blind eye to [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]], while carefully avoiding any activities that might draw the attention of the [[Bureau of Ships and Services/Legends|Bureau of Ships and Services]]. She took a small cut, as well as samples of Core luxury products, as a price for her noninterference.\n\nWhile she allowed the avoidance of import fees and licenses for restricted goods, making [[Kwilaan Starport]] a minor [[Shadowport/Legends|shadowport]], she refused to condone [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] and other activities explicitly illegal under [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] law. She was unconcerned about the laws of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], however.\n\nLaw enforcement failed to link Verbon to any criminal activities, and she maintained a working relationship with [[Republic Intelligence/Legends|Republic Intelligence]] by gathering information on Rim worlds and criminal activities.\n\nHesh Verbon was bilingual, and spoke [[Sullustese/Legends|Sullustese]] in addition to [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]].<ref name=\"Secrets of Naboo\" />\n\n==Personality==\nAn intelligent, if amoral woman, Verbon mainly looked out for herself. She had two major weaknesses, a taste for fine [[Alcohol/Legends|liquors]] and products from the Core, and a abiding curiosity in gossip regarding the high and mighty. She remained an excellent pilot and enjoyed flying craft and socializing with [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]].<ref name=\"Secrets of Naboo\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Secrets of Naboo]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verbon, Hesh}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Portmasters]]"}}}]}}}}
