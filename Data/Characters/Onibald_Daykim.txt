Due to a simple accounting error by a member of his staff, he became the most famous person on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for two [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]]. The error caused [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] to be placed at the top of the public list of loan-defaulters in the [[Galactic City|Imperial City]] for two hours. In retribution for this embarrassment, the Emperor fired the entire board of directors and sought out the one personally responsible for the error. Daykim, along with his fellow bureaucrats, fled into the depths of Coruscant's [[Coruscant underworld|Undercity]] to avoid capture.\n\nIn the Undercity, the bureaucrats remained loyal to Daykim, crowning him [[King/Legends|King]] Daykim. As King, Daykim received the best of their spoils; fine animal skins, and the shoulder pads and gloves of a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]].\n\nThe group tapped into the energy grid of Imperial City with old [[Power generator/Legends|generators]], and used other discarded pieces of machinery to rig up surveillance to protect their patch. So isolated was [[Daykim's Kingdom]], they were unaware of the demise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], until [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] stumbled into their territory, after [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] lost them. Daykim returned the [[Solo twins|twins]] to the surface, but despite assurances of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] benevolence, decided to remain in the Undercity, rather than return to the [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] dullness of surface life.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Onibald Daykim\n|ru=\u041e\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0434 \u0414\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438\u043c\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daykim, Onibald}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Financial professionals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kings]]"}}}]}}}}
