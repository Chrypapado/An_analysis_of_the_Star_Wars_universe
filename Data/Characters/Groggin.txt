Not worth much, but still &hellip;|Darth Vader and Groggin|Clone B-2332-54}}\n'''Groggin''' was an [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]] [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] who supervised [[Smelting Core D]], one of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City's]] most efficient metal processing incinerators. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Groggin discovered in the refuse awaiting [[Gender/Legends|his]] incinerator a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Limb/Legends|hand]] clutching a strange metal cylinder, which was actually the [[Cho mai/Legends|severed]] hand and [[Anakin Skywalker's second lightsaber|lightsaber]] of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], recently lost during his fateful Cloud City [[Duel on Cloud City/Legends|duel]] with the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. When Vader appeared in the smelting chamber demanding the hand and [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Groggin instead suggested they negotiate for the items, unaware of the Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord's]] identity. Unamused, Vader [[Death/Legends|killed]] Groggin and claimed his prize, bound for the [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|personal vaults]] of the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor]] himself.\n\n==Biography==\n===A strange find===\nGroggin was the name of the [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]] [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] in charge of [[Smelting Core D]] within the bowels of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin's]] [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]]<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" /> during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"Date\" /> Groggin saw to it that [[Gender/Legends|his]] smelting core remained one of Cloud City's most efficient metal reclamation centers. Any manner of clutter that could be melted down and reprocessed, from [[Droid/Legends|droid]] parts to bulkhead fittings, was put through Groggin's conveyor and boiled down into base metals or usable alloys.<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\nOne [[Standard day/Legends|day]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\" /> Groggin discovered a strange item in the steaming heap of rubbish destined for his furnace. To his surprise, he picked out from the refuse a cauterized [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Limb/Legends|hand]] clutching a strange metal cylinder&mdash;the same [[Cho mai/Legends|severed]] hand and [[Anakin Skywalker's second lightsaber|lightsaber]] lost by the young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] during his [[Duel on Cloud City/Legends|duel]] with the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] within Cloud City that same day. Judging by the item's lot number, Groggin discerned that the hand had come from the [[City/Legends|city's]] lower air shafts, where apparently the piece of debris had been retrieved by the drones that kept Cloud City's air shaft and piping network free of obstruction.<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\nAlthough Groggin did not know how the hand had made it into his smelting chamber, all that concerned him was the value of metal he had found. As he moved toward the incinerator to discard the hand and melt down the odd cylinder, Groggin heard a strange mechanical breathing from behind. He turned to find a menacing, two-[[Imperial standard meter|meter]]-tall, [[Color/Legends|black]]-[[Cape/Legends|robed]] figure in the doorway&mdash;Vader himself had come to claim Skywalker's hand and [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\n===The Dark Lord does not negotiate===\n{{Quote|You will give me the hand. And the lightsaber. ''Now.\"<br />\"''Now see here &hellip;|Darth Vader and Groggin|Clone B-2332-54}}\n[[File:VaderGroggin-TLCSB.png|thumb|left|300px|Darth Vader Force-chokes Groggin to death.]]\nUtterly failing to grasp the significance of the situation, Groggin immediately countered Vader's demand to give over the hand with one of his own: 2,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], to cover costs, as he noted. He also suggested that they might instead be able to negotiate a trade for Vader's [[Darth Vader's armor|metal helmet]], even though, as Groggin again noted, it was not worth much. Momentarily taken aback at Groggin's insolence, Vader, with emphasized threat, once more demanded the hand and lightsaber. When Groggin protested again, Vader instantly caught the Ugnaught in a [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force choke]], and, with a motion of his wrist, the hand and lightsaber floated to the Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]].<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\nThe other Ugnaughts in the smelting chamber rushed to the gagging Groggin's side, searching for the cause of his mysterious coughing fit, but their leader was already [[Death/Legends|dead]] before they could reach him. His task completed, Vader stalked from the chamber with his prize, another trophy for the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor's]] [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|collection]].<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\nThe severed hand of Luke Skywalker,<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|165-166|Skywalker, Luuke}}</ref> categorized in [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] archives<ref name=\"The Last Command\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> as [[sample B-2332-54]], was later used as the [[Gene/Legends|gene]]tic template for the [[Cloning/Legends|creation]] of a [[Luuke Skywalker|Luke Skywalker clone]]<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]].<ref name=\"ERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGroggin kept Smelting Core D's furnace, one of Cloud City's most efficient, running day and night. However, the Ugnaught engineer was completely ignorant of [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] affairs. When Lord [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader entered his smelting chamber in search of the hand and lightsaber belonging to Luke Skywalker, Groggin was unaware of whom he was addressing. Vader was surprised by Groggin's unusual display of disrespect before proceeding to kill him and claiming the prize, which the impertinent Groggin refused to simply surrender.<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAt the [[Time/Legends|time]] of his death, Groggin wore a work [[Clothing/Legends|outfit]] that included a long-sleeved [[Shirt|undershirt]], an outer tunic, pants, a [[Belt/Legends|belt]], footwear, and work [[Glove/Legends|gloves]].<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGroggin appeared in the short [[in-universe]] narrative ''[[Clone B-2332-54]]'', featured in the [[March]] [[1994]] ''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]'', written by [[Eric S. Trautmann]]. The story provides an explanation for how the Empire recovers Luke Skywalker's hand and lightsaber, lost during his duel with Darth Vader on Cloud City, which are eventually used for the purpose of creating a Skywalker clone,<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" /> as seen in the accompanying novel ''[[The Last Command]]''.<ref name=\"The Last Command\" /> Artist [[Tim Eldred]] provided the sourcebook's illustration of Groggin.<ref name=\"Clone B-2332-54\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Last Command Sourcebook|story=Clone B-2332-54|stext=''Clone B-2332-54''}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook|story=Clone B-2332-54|stext=''Clone B-2332-54''}} {{C|Republished}}\n*{{GalaxyCite|11|The Emperor's Trophy}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Anakin Skywalker: The Story of Darth Vader]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ugnaughts]]"}}}]}}}}
