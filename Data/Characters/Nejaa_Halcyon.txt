Unbeknownst to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], Master Halcyon was married to [[Scerra Horn|a Corellian woman]] and was the biological father of [[Hal Horn|Valin Halcyon]]. During his service to the Order, he befriended the [[Caamasi]] Jedi [[Ylenic It'kla]], who remembered him as '''Spicewood''' in his [[Memnis|''memnii'']]. He was soon slain by the [[Dark Acolyte/Legends|Dark Acolyte]] [[Nikkos Tyris]] towards the end of the war, but was survived by his family even after the fall of the Republic and the disbandment of the Order. His wife, Scerra, married Halcyon's friend [[Rostek Horn]], and took his surname in order to further hide their identities from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early history===\n{{Quote|Your grandfather, Rostek Horn, is really your step-grandfather. As you know he partnered with a Jedi before the Clone Wars, and that Jedi died serving away from Corellia, right after the Clone Wars. That Jedi, Nejaa Halcyon, was my father. He served as my Master before he went away.|Hal Horn to his son Corran|I, Jedi}}\nLike almost all Jedi in the later days of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Nejaa Halcyon was identified at an early age as [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and taken to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] as an [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Initiate]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Crafting a silver-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] for his own use, Halcyon would progress through the ranks of the Order in the ensuing years&mdash; achieving the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] by [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]]. After additional training as a [[Jedi Guardian]] as well as dabbling in the work of the [[Jedi recruiter|recruiters]] of the [[Acquisition Division/Legends|Acquisition Division]], Halcyon ascended to the rank of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] and was presented with a [[Jedi Credit|Credit]] chip, a tradition amongst the [[Corellian Jedi]]. He would later present this medallion to his good friend and [[Corellian Security Force]] member [[Rostek Horn]].<ref name=\"X-Wing\" />\n\nMaster Halcyon worked with the Acquisition Division circa [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]], working as a recruiter on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. It was around this time that Master Halcyon discovered the Force-sensitive [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Boc Aseca]]; Halcyon determined the boy to be too old to begin training on Coruscant and refused him admittance into the Order.<ref>{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050526a|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 4|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100430201940}}</ref> While loyal to the Order and the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], Master Halcyon disobeyed the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] by taking marriage vows with a Corellian woman named [[Scerra Horn|Scerra]]. Together, without the High Council's knowledge, the couple had a child who they named [[Hal Horn|Valin]]. While Halcyon worked to hide his family from the Order, he always suspected that [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] knew of the child.<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|Reinforcing their pledge to protect the Republic, two-dozen Jedi from the Corellian sector returned to the Jedi Temple after a careful review of their homeworlds' security.|HoloNet News Jedi Watch Report|HoloNet News Vol. 531 54}}\n[[File:Jedi_Trial.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Halcyon's friend, Skywalker, with [[Erk H'Arman]] and [[Odie Subu]] during the battle.]]\nWhen the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]] closed its borders during the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]], Halcyon led a contingent of Corellian Jedi to the planet to insure that the system's security was up to par. The groups' involvement in the sector raised questions as to where their loyalties were placed; the group returned to the Republic proper after their investigation, stating that, ''\"Our commitment is to the Jedi Council and the Republic that it serves, but we are Corellians by blood and will always have a connection to our home.\"''<ref name=\"HNN54\" />\n\nAs the Separatist Crisis between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Master Halcyon led a team of Jedi Knights to locate and recapture the ''[[Scarlet Thranta]]'', a rogue [[Judicial Department/Legends|Judicial Department]] [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] whose [[Captain/Legends|captain]] and crew had defected from the Republic. Intercepting the ship, Halcyon hailed the rogue Captain [[Zozridor Slayke]] over the planet [[Bpfassh]]. Slayke dispatched his [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]], a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] named [[Grudo]], to aggravate Halcyon and attempt to defeat him in a fight. While Halcyon was distracted with Grudo, Captain Slayke managed to slip under the notice of the Jedi and board Halcyon's ship, the ''[[Plooriod Bodkin]]''. Fleeing the world, Halcyon and his crew were left stranded for months with their single prisoner; Halcyon was disgraced in the media and lost the respect of many of his peers, though no one mentioned his failure around the Temple. Having been rescued by the High Council, Halcyon was stripped of his command of the mission to hunt Slayke and found himself resigned to sitting around the Temple without an assignment.<ref name=\"JT\" />\n\nWhen the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted out of the Separatist Crisis, Halcyon received many minor missions, but did not lead many large battles early in the war. Assigned to Corellia late in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Halcyon went undercover as the [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Ratri Tane]] so as to gain information against the CIS. Later, Jedi [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] and [[Ylenic It'kla]] were [[Mission to Corellia (Clone Wars)|dispatched]] to find Tane and retrieve the information he had gathered. Discovering that Tane was actually Master Halcyon, the Jedi managed to succeed in the mission and keep the information from the Confederacy.<ref>{{InsiderCite|66|Elusion Illusion}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Master Halcyon was given his first major assignment by the High Council. Recommended by [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] by name, Halcyon quickly accepted the mission, and took the news that he would be serving alongside Captain Zozridor Slayke with grace. Charged with protecting the [[Intergalactic Communications Center]] on [[Praesitlyn]] from the Confederacy, Halcyon chose Jedi [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] as his second in command, having gotten to know him during his time stationed at the Temple. Devising a battle plan to relieve Slayke's outnumbered organization, the [[Sons and Daughters of Freedom|Freedom's Sons]], Halcyon and Skywalker's initial plan was met with failure. Crafting a desperate rescue mission for the men and women on the ground, Halcyon was able to lead a successful assault on the planet while Skywalker was able to capture Separatist [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Pors Tonith/Legends|Pors Tonith]].<ref name=\"JT\" />\n\nHaving regained the full confidence of the High Council, Halcyon was granted the title of [[Jedi General/Legends|General]] in the ranks of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]. Accepting many missions, Master Halcyon served alongside [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]] at some point in the conflict. In the last year of the war, Master Halcyon accompanied his friend, Master It'kla, and \"[[Desertwind]]\", to [[Susevfi]] on a mission to neutralize the threat posed by the [[Jensaarai/Legends|Jensaarai]] cult. Confronting the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Nikkos Tyris]], Halcyon entered into a duel to the death which neither combatant walked away from. Recovering Master Halcyon's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Master It'kla reported his friend's demise to the High Council and turned over the [[Nejaa Halcyon's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to the [[Galactic Museum]]'s Jedi [[Jedi Museum|exhibit]].<ref name=\"IJ\">''[[I, Jedi]]''</ref>\n\nLearning of his friend's death, Rostek Horn broke the news to Scerra and her son. Vowing to help them through their hardship, the family was even more troubled when the Jedi Order was disbanded and the Republic replaced by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Horn and the widow Halcyon eventually fell in love with each other and married, with the family adopting the Horn surname to further hide from the Empire. Adopting young Valin, they began to call him Hal, in honor of his father's legacy. Passing on Halcyon's Jedi Credit coin, who in turn passed it on to his son [[Corran Horn|Corran]], the family did not know much of Nejaa Halcyon's legacy until the ship the ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' launched out of the Coruscant cityscape. Locating the lost museum of the Jedi, Corran Horn discovered Halcyon's lightsaber among the exhibit.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Of course I remember your name.

Halcyon befriended the young [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] after just a few sparring sessions at the [[Jedi Temple]], admiring his technique learned in the war and from Halcyon's acquaintance, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]].

However, he had a talent for [[Tutaminis|absorbing energy]], such as from blaster bolts or lightsaber blades.
