Born into poverty, he roamed the streets of Veterned, not able to hold down a job until he found work in [[Freon Drevan]]'s [[Freon Drevan's bootlegging business|criminal organization]] as a factory worker, producing counterfeit [[Gasgano/Legends|Gasgano]] [[Podracing/Legends|podracing]] merchandise. He was also given the opportunity to swindle innocent beings, and the way in which he acquitted himself impressed Drevan to such a degree that the young Fieso soon found himself the most valued member of the organization. Together, Fieso and Drevan entered the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] business.\n\nFieso, however, tired of Drevan and set his elder up for a fall, alerting the authorities and leaving Drevan with tax debt. Striking out on his own, Fieso enjoyed success away from Troiken and masqueraded as an agent for Gasgano. He tried his hand at swindling the businesses of the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], but he soon attracted the attention of the [[Corporate Sector Authority/Legends|Corporate Sector Authority]]. Chased out of the Corporate Sector by the [[Security Police]], Fieso tried to lay low on the arid world of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. There, he found work as a vendor at the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Mos Espa Grand Arena]] during the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. What Fieso did not realize was that Drevan was present in the crowd, and after a very public fight, the pair found themselves in [[Mos Espa jail|jail]], with Fieso transferred to the Corporate Sector Authority's custody.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHailing from [[Veterned]], the capital city of [[Troiken/Legends|Troiken]], Niai Fieso was born to a poor family. His parents could not afford an education for him, and so the young [[Xexto/Legends|Xexto]] spent most of his youth roaming the city streets. He was able to find brief employment in a series of odd-jobs, but his course eventually led him into Veterned's criminal world. Fieso found himself working for the confidence trickster [[Freon Drevan]], who ran a [[Freon Drevan's bootlegging business|bootleg racket]] selling a variety of merchandise \"connected\" to a famous son of Troiken, the [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]] [[Gasgano/Legends|Gasgano]].<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"dbg\">{{DB|character|gasgano|Gasgano|archivedate=20101126072351}}</ref>\n\nFieso's initial role in Drevan's organization was that of a factory worker, producing the merchandise for Drevan to sell. He was also given the opportunity to fleece unsuspecting citizens, and Drevan was impressed with the way in which Fieso deceived beings with his friendly demeanor. The younger Xexto quickly advanced through the ranks of the organization until he became Drevan's most trusted associate. Together, the pair expanded the organization beyond simple bootlegging and into the world of [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]]. Their cargo was, invariably, illegal wares, such as [[Spice/Legends|spice]].<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Lone operator===\n[[File:Niai_Fieso.png|thumb|left|250px|Fieso working as a food vendor on Tatooine in 32 BBY.]]\nEventually, Fieso tired of having Drevan as his superior, and he began plotting to be rid of the older Xexto. To begin with, he siphoned profits from their spice smuggling racket, and then tipped off the authorities as to Drevan's activities,<ref name=\"db\" /> before fleeing the system.<ref name=\"ccg\">{{CCG|set=Coruscant Limited|link=Coruscant-Light/large/freondrevan.gif|cardname=Freon Drevan}}</ref> The resulting raid ended with Devan being jailed,<ref name=\"db\" /> his business license revoked,<ref name=\"ccg\" /> and Fieso free to pursue his own ventures.<ref name=\"db\" /> Drevan was also left with tax debt.<ref name=\"ccg\" /> Fieso managed to succeed by himself as a confidence trickster, scamming naive beings and businesses for hefty profits. One of the most profitable of his schemes involved posing as Gasgano's agent.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nTaking his business to the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], Fieso managed to lure businesses there into \"exclusive sponsorship deals\" for Gasgano. The projected profits of the gambit would set up the Xexto for retirement, but his actions attracted the attention of the [[Corporate Sector Authority/Legends|Corporate Sector Authority]]. One of the Authority's [[Attorney General]]s called Fieso's bluff, and the Xexto found himself set upon by [[Security Police]]. Evading them, Fieso fled the sector with what little he still had to his name.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nIn order to not attract anymore attention, Fieso traveled to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he intended to lay low, as he had very few credits. In the spaceport of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]], he found work as a food vendor,<ref name=\"db\" /> selling refreshments such as [[Gorg/Legends|gorgs]] at the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Mos Espa Grand Arena]] during the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] of [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]].<ref name=\"dvd\">{{SWArchive|url=episode-i/release/video/f20010910/index.html|text=DVD Undelete: The Never-Before Seen Menace|archivedate=20041023184558}}</ref> Although the job was legitimate, Fieso saw the podracing crowd as the perfect target for his scamming ways. As he searched for potential marks, he was hit thrice in the face by Drevan, who was amongst the crowd. A fight between the two Xextos broke out, and they both were thrown in [[Mos Espa jail|jail]]. Subsequently, Fieso was placed in the custody of the Corporate Sector Authority.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNiai Fieso possessed a warm and friendly demeanor&mdash;at least while liberating targets of their credits. That demeanor helped Fieso rise to prominence in Freon Drevan's organization, and he advanced quickly through the ranks because of it. However, Fieso was an ambitious being, and he did not hesitate in swindling his own boss. He even sold Drevan out to local authorities so he could work as a lone operator. For a while, his skill gave him success as a con-man, but when trying to take on the Corporate Sector, he found himself out of his depth. Although he attempted to settle down and lay low, even while working in a legitimate job he found himself wanting to swindle innocent beings.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Niai Fieso first appeared, unnamed, in the DVD release of [[1999]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], in a shot not included in the original theatrical release, during the film's podracing sequence. In [[2007]], the character was identified and given a story by [[Sander de Lange]], writing as \"exarxan\" through the [[StarWars.com]] [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"[[What's The Story?]]\" For the character's name, de Lange used anagrams of two of his friends' names: \"Iain\" and \"Sofie.\" Searching for possible connections to the character, de Lange looked up other existing Xexto in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]], finding two suitable candidates: [[Tosinqas]] from ''[[HoloNet News Vol. 531 53]]'', and Freon Drevan, identified in the \"[[Coruscant Limited]]\" set of the [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|''Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game]]. De Lange used Tosinqas in a second \"What's The Story?\" entry he sent in and opted to connect Drevan to his Fieso story.<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|exar_xan|13|Behind the story - Niai Fieso|The chronicles of a writer|Sander de Lange|archivedate=20090808024154}}</ref>\n\nDrevan's card in \"Coruscant Limited\" mentioned a \"partner\" who scammed the character, leaving him with tax debt. de Lange opted to [[retcon]] his character into that role. The phrasing \"right-hands Xexto\" from the finished [[Databank (original)|Databank]] entry de Lange attributed to [[Timothy Carlsson]], who helped polish the submission. De Lange tied the character to the Corporate Sector from [[Brian Daley]]'s [[1979]] novel, ''[[Han Solo at Stars' End]]'', as he intended to have his character incarcerated in the [[Stars' End/Legends|Stars' End]] prison. The reference was cut from the final entry, as it was too early chronologically for the prison to have existed.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{C|DVD edition}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=Coruscant Limited|link=Coruscant-Light/large/freondrevan.gif|cardname=Freon Drevan}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|niaifieso|Fieso, Niai|archivedate=20100330010710}} {{1stID}}\n*{{SW|url=news/this-is-podracing-sports-in-the-star-wars-galaxy-part-1|text=This Is Podracing: Sports in the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy, Part 1|int=Sports in the Star Wars Galaxy}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-i/release/video/f20010910/index.html|text=DVD Undelete: The Never-Before Seen Menace|archivedate=20041023184558}}\n*{{Blog|exar_xan|13|Behind the story - Niai Fieso|The chronicles of a writer|Sander de Lange|archivedate=20090808024154}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Niai Fieso\n|fr=Niai Fieso\n|nl=Niai Fieso\n|ja=\u30cb\u30a2\u30a4\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30bd\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fieso, Niai}}\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Troiken residents]]\n[[Category:Xexto]]"}}}]}}}}
