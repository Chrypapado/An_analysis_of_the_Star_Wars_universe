He and twelve-year-old Padm\u00e9 had a brief relationship. However, they went their separate ways when Palo became an [[Artist/Legends|artist]] and Padm\u00e9 continued in [[Politics/Legends|politics]], although he never fully got over her.\n\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Amidala talked about Palo to her future husband, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], teasing the young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] by describing her first love in details with a suggestive tone of voice.\n\nFor a time after [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Palo was living in [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]], continuing his career as an artist.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', Palo could be found at a gazebo in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] at the coordinates 4765, -4797. He gave three completable missions, but the text for them was bugged. He was eventually removed from the [[Video game|game]] by its developers relatively early in the game's lifespan.\n\nThe character was originally set to return as Padm\u00e9 Amidala's love interest for the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode \"[[Senate Spy]]\". However, this idea was eventually abandoned when the crew remembered that Palo left politics to become an artist (as mentioned by Amidala in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']]). The show's creators also felt that the relationship between Amidala and the \"Senate Spy\" character had to be more recent than the one between her and Palo, so that the theme of Anakin Skywalker's jealousy would be better supported. Palo was thus replaced by a new character, [[Rush Clovis/Legends|Rush Clovis]].<ref>{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode204.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Senate Spy|archivedate=20110819210357}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' novelization]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (unabridged audiobook)|''Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2014 Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' comic]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{Mo}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/senate-spy-episode-guide|text=\"Senate Spy\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Padm\u00e9 Naberrie Amidala entry}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Palo#legends\n|es=Palo\n|pl=Palo\n|ru=\u041f\u0430\u043b\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Palo}}\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
