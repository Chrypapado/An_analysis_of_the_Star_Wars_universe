I have never been able to understand why, actually.|Anetia Kah'ryn, to an entertainer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Anetia Kah'ryn resided in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] and worked as an entertainer at the [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|local cantina]].<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Kah'ryn was very concerned about criminal and [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken]] activity around Mos Eisley. She identified several individuals who might have useful information and were known to frequent the [[Cantina/Legends|cantinas]] of Tatooine. Around the same, the Twi'lek started to teach a group of entertainer trainees who had just arrived on Tatooine. Kah'ryn therefore tasked her trainees to establish themselves as performers in the [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] Cantina, in the [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] Tavern and in the [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]] [[Bestine Hotel|Hotel]] to get information. Anetia, a performer herself, found that patrons were more willing to divulge information after they have been entertained. The entertainers were very skillful and enjoyed great success among the consumers. Moreover, they convinced three people, [[Dorn Gestros]], [[Crix Yarrow]] and [[Borra Setas]], to reveal what they knew about recent criminal and Tusken activity in Mos Eisley. Anetia Kah'ryn later sent the entertainers to a party full of very important people held by [[Rauk Oenish]] in Mos Eisley. They discovered that [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] was inciting the Tusken Raiders to attack Mos Eisley in order to pressurize the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of Mos Eisley and eventually take control of the city. Anetia Kah'ryn and her trainees revealed their discoveries to Mayor [[Mikdanyell Guh'rantt]].<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> The plot was finally foiled by a group of [[Sniper/Legends|marksmans]] led by [[Purvis Arrison]] who eliminated the Tusken vanguard unit in [[Junktown]].<ref name=\"SWG:MT\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Marksman|Marksman Tasks|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAnetia Kah'ryn was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Anetia Kah'ryn was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 17 Notes for 26 May 2005|Publish 17]]\", on [[May 26]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:2005\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref> She was a specialized trainer providing a quest to the beginner players who had chosen a career of \"[[W:c:swg:Entertainer (pre-NGE)|entertainer]]\".<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Anetia Kah'ryn's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]],<ref name=\"SWG:2005\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Total Experience}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Anetia Kah'ryn}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kah'ryn, Anetia}}\n[[Category:Entertainers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
