Shocked by this development, Neena tried to contact her old friend [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], but without funds provided by the [[House of Organa/Legends|Organa household]], she was stranded.<ref name=\"GG6-1\" />\n\nWithout an alternative, Neena began performing on space liners, trying to pick ships heading toward anyone she knew but without much success. After several months, she gave up, and soon was making a decent but boring living entertaining the decadent beings of the planet [[Adarlon/Legends|Adarlon]] in the Minos Cluster. There, she was approached by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent [[Drun Cairnwick]], who recruited her to the cause of the Rebellion and sent her to the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] headquarters of [[Travnin/Legends|Travnin]].<ref name=\"GG6-1\" />\n\nNeena built a solid reputation playing at [[The Grand Design]] spacer's bar on Travnin, attempting to get a job performing aboard the [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[The Chariot]]'' to gather information on the sector [[Moff/Legends|Moff]]. She arranged for free traders visiting the bar to deliver supplies to local Rebels on behalf of underworld figure [[Tecknel Shnick]]. She was successful in gathering information on ''The Chariot'', passing it on to Rebel agents during the revolt in the Cluster.<ref name=\"GG6-2\" />\n\n{{Unlicensedstart}}\n\nShe was also known to deal with [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] and other such lowlifes, and once hired a down-on-their-luck smuggling crew to steal a batch of prototype [[Holorecorder/Legends|holocorders]] from the [[Nadir Corporation]]. When they returned with the holocorders, she got [[LREED]] to offload them and paid the group 4,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] then offered them the job of delivering a [[holocrystal]] and business card to her friend in [[Pwosson Pictures]] on Adarlon. She informed the group to look her up whenever they were back on Travnin.<ref name=\"Challenge68\">''[[Challenge 68]]''</ref>\n\n{{Unlicensedend}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNeena was almost invariably regarded as \"cute\" by those who encountered her.<ref name=\"GG6-2\" /> Her hair was brown and waist-length, often getting in her way when performing various tasks.<ref name=\"GG6-1\" />\n\nNeena was friendly, with an endearingly impish nature and disarming smile, but her horrible memories of losing her friends on Alderaan made her introverted and gave her difficulty becoming close to others. She believed wholeheartedly in the Rebellion and respected those who put their lives on the line to defeat the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"GG6-2\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Challenge 68]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"}}}]}}}}
