She had multiple sons and was a friend of Artorian [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Nina Galfridian]]. Jenny was severely wounded during the initial Yuuzhan Vong attack and was captured along with Galfridian. She later [[Death/Legends|succumbed]] to her wounds while in captivity aboard the [[slaveship]] [[Heart of Artorias|''Tsam P'ah'']].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Good morning. Where's Finn?|Jenny, greeting Nina|Invasion 1}}\nJenny was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] shopkeeper who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Artorias]]. In addition to having at least two sons, she was a friend of the planet's [[Queen/Legends|queen]], [[Nina Galfridian]],<ref name=\"InvRef1\" /> and Galfridian's stepdaughter,<ref name=\"InvRes4\">''[[Invasion: Rescues 4]]</ref> [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]]. The Galfridians were visiting Jenny's shop when the [[extra-galactic]] [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Battle of Artorias|invaded]] Artorias in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]]. After Jenny greeted the Galfridians and inquired about the whereabouts<ref name=\"InvRef1\" /> of Nina's stepson,<ref name=\"InvRes4\" /> [[Finn Galfridian|Finn]], Nina asked how much a pot cost, but before she could finish the question, the pot exploded in Nina's hand. The shrapnel injured Jenny in the chest and mouth, and she collapsed into the Queen's arms.<ref name=\"InvRef1\" />\n\nJenny was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong along with many other Artorians, including Nina and Kaye Galfridian, and was placed on board the [[slaveship]] [[Heart of Artorias|''Tsam P'ah'']] with the other captives. When the invaders attempted to force Nina to serve as a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] to [[Sha'kel|their commander]], she instead requested that they treat Jenny's injuries, but they refused. Soon afterward, Jenny [[Death/Legends|died]] from her wounds.<ref name=\"InvRef2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Nina&hellip;''\"<br />\"''Hang on, Jenny.|Jenny and Nina, after being taken prisoner|Invasion 1}}\nJenny was a good friend of the Artorian Queen, sometimes addressing her by her first name<ref name=\"InvRef1\" /> rather than the formal title of \"Your Majesty.\"<ref name=\"InvRef2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Jenny first appeared in the [[Invasion 1|first issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Invasion]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Tom Taylor]].
