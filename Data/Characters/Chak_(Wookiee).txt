You heard the lady. Let's take the ''Mynock'' for a run and see if you're as good as Kee keeps sayin' you are.|[[Jariah Syn]]|Legacy (2006) 18}}\n[[File:Chak.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chak as a Wookiee youngling during the Clone Wars]]\nChak was the grandson of [[Gumbaeki]], elder of the village of [[Palsaang]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], a village targeted by [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]], under the cover of the [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|Battle of Kashyyyk]]. At this time, the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Vilmarh Grahrk]], whom Chak affectionately referred to as \"Uncle Villie\", had been living in the village, smuggling goods to and from the Wookiee [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. During the year or so that Grahrk was with them, the young Chak served as co-pilot of Grahrk's ship, the [[Inferno (Vilmarh Grahrk)|''Inferno'']]. He was also an apprentice in the [[Claatuvac Guild/Legends|Claatuvac Guild]].\n\nFollowing the issue of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], Chak also helped Grahrk's old friend [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] survive assault by his own troopers in the jungles of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. He was responsible for the deaths of [[Bogey 1212]] and [[Bogey 9662]], two members of [[Bogey Squad]].\n\nLater, Chak was present at the [[Battle of Kashyyyk (19 BBY)|Battle of Kashyyyk]], after which he fled Imperial enslavement and hid in the far regions of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\nA century and a half later, around [[137 ABY]], the adult Chak was the captain of the smuggling ship ''[[Grinning Liar]]''. He had a reputation as a faithful ally to his friends, who included ex-[[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Cade Skywalker]], but it was a bad move to make an enemy of him.\n\nLike Cade, he and his co-pilot [[Kee (Devaronian)|Kee]] could often be found in [[Rik's Cantina/Legends|Rik's Cantina]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. It was here that the two found Cade. It transpired that Cade's former crew members, [[Jariah Syn]] and [[Deliah Blue]], had rented the ''Grinning Liar'', but had neglected to return the vessel. Kee and Chak found Cade had no idea where the ship was, though Skywalker promised to let his friends know they were being looked for. Chak was not happy with this response.\n\nChak later tracked down Blue and Syn. He demanded the ''Grinning Liar'' back, but Syn said that [[Rav]] had taken it long ago. But as an argument began, an Imperial agent named [[Morrigan Corde]] approached them. She revealed to them that she was Cade's mother, and needed their help to get him out of the Sith Temple. Chak accepted the offer. Later, Chak was persuaded to purchase the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']] to help in the rescue operation (records of Chak purchasing the ''Mynock'' would throw the Imperials off the track). The rescue mission was a success, and Chak piloted the ship away from Coruscant after Cade was on board.\n\nChak, along with Cade, Syn, and Kee went after Rav to get the ''Grinning Liar'' back after the rescue mission. Rav was forced to hand the ship over after his thugs were beaten by Cade and his friends. Chak said he was going to get lost in the galaxy after recovering his ship, advising Cade to do the same.\n\nChak carried a [[hunting blaster carbine]].<ref>Legacy Era Campaign Guide</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ChakAndKee.jpg|thumb|right|Chak and Kee concept art]]\nChak first appeared in the [[Star Wars: Republic: Hidden Enemy|final arc]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' comic series, penned by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Jan Duursema]] and published in [[2006]]. He later reappeared in the [[Star Wars: Legacy: Claws of the Dragon|fourth arc]] of ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' as an associate of Cade Skywalker and his crew.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Hidden Enemy]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 11|''Legacy'' (2006) 11]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 14|''Legacy'' (2006) 14]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 16|''Legacy'' (2006) 16]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 17|''Legacy'' (2006) 17]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 18|''Legacy'' (2006) 18]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 19|''Legacy'' (2006) 19]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|121|Launchpad|Launch Pad}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Chak\n|de=Chak\n|es=Chak (wookiee)\n|pl=Chak\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
