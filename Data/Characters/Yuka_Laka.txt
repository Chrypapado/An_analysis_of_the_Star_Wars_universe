It is a long-time fantasy of mine.|[[HK-47]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Yuka Laka''' was a [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was a droid dealer in the [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] settlement on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], during the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nLaka dealt in selling droid upgrades as well as swoop parts. He then purchased [[HK-47]] from a [[Unidentified Czerka Corporation warehouse manager|friend]] from an off-world [[Unidentified Czerka Corporation warehouse|warehouse]] who was in debt, claiming 'no-one would miss it'. He believed it was a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], unaware of his true nature as an [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droid]]. Using whatever qualifications he could identify from the droid, he tried to sell it to two moisture farmers, but it just stood still and made them lose interest in it. He then later sold the droid to an amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was unaware at the time that he was HK-47's creator and original master.\n\n==Personality==\nYuka Laka was a greedy merchant, and according to HK-47, a poor mechanic. A [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] conservationist visiting Tatooine said he would call rust gold to make a sale. The assassin droid also described him as a weak coward; in fact, HK-47 showed no respect for Yuka Laka, even when he was his master. However, Yuka Laka actually did not respect him either, calling him a stubborn thing prior to purchase, as well as calling him a 'worn out' droid. He also refused to answer any qualities about HK after Revan purchased the droid, claiming that any problems encountered were Revan's, not his.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYuka Laka first offers [[HK-47]] to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] for 5,000 credits. However, Laka immediately drops this price to 4,000 credits the moment [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] objects, claiming \"Some people will bite straight away\". Revan can then have the option to use either [[Mind trick/Legends|Force Persuade]] or use normal persuasion abilities to make Laka drop the price to 3,000 or 2,500 credits. If the player takes the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] option, he can threaten Laka, at which point he will drop the price to 2,500 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], the lowest price. If the player takes the dark side path, he will be unable to shop again at Laka's store. It should also be noted that, if the player tries to buy HK-47 while on the dark side, the only options are to drop the price and to say they are not interested, thus preventing the player from buying HK-47 until they return to the light side of the force.\n\nThere was another dark side option that was cut from the final game which was to kill Yuka Laka at [[HK-47]]'s request. The consequences were to kill Yuka Laka and regain the credits used to purchase HK-47 and a [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] pistol.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|droid|hk47|HK-47|archivedate=20110208074238}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u042e\u043a\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u043a\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laka, Yuka}}\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
