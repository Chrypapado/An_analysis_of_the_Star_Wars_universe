When [[Olee Starstone]] traveled to Kashyyyk with Filli Bitters, it was Bitters who put her in touch with Cudgel. Cudgel's contacts included [[Tarfful/Legends|Tarfful]] and the leaders of [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]], who agreed to help the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] with their search. This effort was cut short when [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces descended on Kashyyyk, subduing entire cities in an effort to capture Wookiee slaves to work on the construction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]]. The group might not have escaped the attacks, but [[Roan Shryne]] suddenly arrived on the planet and confronted [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] himself. This allowed Starstone, the surviving Jedi, Cudgel, and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] to escape aboard the ''[[Drunk Dancer]]''. However, after seeing [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]] in flames, Cudgel and Chewbacca both asked to join the crew of the ''Drunk Dancer'', to ride out the trouble on Kashyyyk and plan an eventual return to the planet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cudgel#legends\n|ja=\u30af\u30c3\u30c9\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\n}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Translators and interpreters]]"}}}]}}}}
