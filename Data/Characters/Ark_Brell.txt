However, when the planet was [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombarded]] by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Malak]], many of the world's factories and plants were destroyed and spilled toxic waste across the surface. Hundreds of [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, the area around the [[Taris ChemWorks Factory]] had become known as the [[Brell Sediment]], and an [[Acid/Legends|acid]] lake in the area had been named [[Lake Brell]] after the environmentalist, as a persistent legend stated that the lake had been formed by the waste from one of Brell's own factories.<ref name=\"Codex\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nArk Brell was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Brell Sediment in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[video game]] released by [[BioWare]] in [[2011]].<ref name=\"Codex\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}} {{Codex}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brell, Ark}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
