A [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Kira grew up during the turbulent period known as the [[Beast Wars]], when the Beast Riders, [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|cast out]] of the Onderonian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], went to war with the great walled [[City/Legends|city]]. The son of [[Beast-Lord]] [[Modon Kira]], Oron Kira secretly traveled in and out of Iziz for [[Standard year/Legends|years]], [[Merchant/Legends|trading]] with the [[Politics/Legends|political]] underground. On one trip, he met the love of his life, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Galia]], heiress to the Onderonian [[Onderon Royal Family|throne]]. Galia reciprocated Kira's feelings, but the circumstances of the war would never allow a Beast Rider and the Princess of Onderon to [[Marriage/Legends|marry]]. Kira and Galia formulated a plan to circumvent their dilemma in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]]; Kira and a fellow Beast Rider, [[Gobee]], would [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|break into]] the [[Iziz Royal Palace]] and \"kidnap\" Galia, bringing her back to [[Kira Fortress|Kira's fortress]] beyond Iziz's borders so they could be wed. The plan went off without hitch, and their [[Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia|marriage]] soon began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by three [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]&mdash;Human brothers [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic]] and [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tott Doneeta]]&mdash;sent by [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]] to retrieve Galia. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] nearly made off with the Princess, but, after she protested and professed her love for Kira, she was returned to her betrothed. Kira and his family then revealed the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] corruption of the Onderonian monarchy to the Jedi and enlisted them in the campaign to end the Beast Wars once and for all.\n\nAfter peace negotiations with Amanoa failed, Kira fought with a massive [[Beast Rider army]] in a [[Battle of Iziz|final assault]] on Iziz. Although Amanoa's dark [[Sith magic|magic]] took a heavy toll on the Beast Riders, Kira's forces finally took Iziz, thanks to the [[battle meditation]] of newly-arrived [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]]. Amanoa [[Death/Legends|died]] at the end of the battle, and Kira became the new King of Onderon. As monarch, Kira soon faced another crisis, the [[Freedon Nadd Uprising]], during which [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]]ists, led by former King [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], rose up and waged war on the new Onderonian regime. Although the Iziz Royal Palace was destroyed and Kira and Galia were briefly forced out of Iziz, they retook the city with help from the Jedi and put an end to the rebellion. Kira also fought in several more battles in the next few years; he lent his Beast Riders to Jedi forces in an [[Second Battle of Empress Teta|engagement]] on [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]] in [[3997 BBY]], an attempt to retrieve Ulic Qel-Droma, who had begun to fall to the dark side, from the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] cult on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. The next year, Kira and his fellow Beast Riders successfully [[Battle of Onderon (Great Sith War)|defended]] Onderon from an [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] invaders during the Great Sith War. His descendants went on to hold the Onderonian throne for more than four thousand years.\n\n==Biography==\n===Becoming the King===\n{{Dialogue|Galia|My marriage to Oron Kira can mark the beginning of a new age!|Oron Kira|And if you will ''not'' listen, know that the skies will soon grow ''dark'' with the beating wings of our ''warbeasts!''|Amanoa|You want ''darkness'', Kira? ''I'll show you darkness!''|attr=Oron Kira, Galia, and Queen Amanoa, prior to the siege of Iziz|src=Tales of the Jedi 2}}\nOron Kira was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the wilds of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], born sometime before the onset of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. Kira was reared amongst the [[Beast Riders]], a society of dissidents who thrived on their [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|banishment]] from the great walled [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] by taming and riding the dangerous beasts of the Onderonian wilderness. Kira was the son of [[Beast-Lord]] [[Modon Kira]], the leader of the Beast Riders, and the grandson of [[Drokko Kira]], a man who was cast out of Iziz for challenging the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]-[[Naddist|worshiping]] [[Onderon Royal Family|monarchy]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Kira grew up in the [[Time/Legends|time]] of unending [[Beast Wars|war]] between the Beast Riders and Iziz, when Kira's people struck back against those who had cast them out. Although banned from Iziz, Oron and his [[Parent/Legends|father]] secretly went in and out of the city for [[Standard year/Legends|years]], [[Merchant/Legends|trading]] with the [[Politics/Legends|political]] underground there. While on one of his secret journeys into Onderon, Kira ventured into the [[Garden/Legends|garden]] of the [[Iziz Royal Palace]]; there, he caught a glimpse of [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Galia]], heiress to the Onderonian throne. It was love at first sight for the two, and in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], they arranged to run away together. As it was unthinkable that the Princess of Onderon would [[Marriage/Legends|marry]] a Beast-Lord, their plan was for a contingent of Beast Riders to [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|kidnap]] Galia from the palace and bring her back to [[Kira Fortress|Kira's fortress]], where their [[Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia|wedding]] would take place.<ref name=\"beastwars\" />\n\n[[File:WarriorCommandos.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Oron Kira and Gobee during their raid on the Iziz Royal Palace]]\nThe plan went off without hitch, as Kira and his right-hand man, [[Gobee]],<ref name=\"audio\" /> successfully retrieved Galia and brought her to the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]], where the wedding promptly began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by a group of three [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]&mdash;brothers [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic]] and [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tott Doneeta]]&mdash;who rode in on [[Animal bond|tamed]] [[boma]] beasts. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] had been hired by Galia's mother, [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]], to bring her back to Iziz. The Knights' bold charge proved initially successful, as Ulic Qel-Droma was able to grab hold of Galia in an attempted rescue. However, Galia expressed her willingness to marry the Beast-Lord, and, at the behest of Modon Kira, the Jedi laid down their arms as Oron and Galia embraced. With hostilities between the Beast Riders and the Jedi put to an end, the intruders were invited to join the Kiras at the wedding banquet. There, Oron told the Jedi Knights about how he and Galia fell in love and revealed that the Onderonian [[King/Legends|monarchs]] were in fact dark side [[Darksider|servants]]. Hoping to put an end to the conflict between Iziz and the Beast Riders, Ulic Qel-Droma proposed that he go to Iziz with Oron and Galia to ask Amanoa for peace. Although Oron thought this plan unwise, Drokko Kira, speaking for the first time in decades, agreed with Qel-Droma's idea and asked for the Jedi to go to war with the dark side if the peace talks failed. The plan of action was then set: Oron, Galia, and the Jedi visitors would travel to the Iziz Royal Palace in Qel-Droma's [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Nebulon Ranger]]'', and begin peace talks with Amanoa; if they failed, Modon Kira would lead the [[Beast Rider army]] against Iziz in [[Battle of Iziz|one final battle]].<ref name=\"beastwars\" />\n\nWhen the group reached the Iziz Royal Palace, however, Amanoa rejected their offer of peace. Although Kira threatened to unleash the full might of the Beast Rider [[Army/Legends|army]] upon the city, Amanoa held firm and, in an act of rage, [[Invoke spirits|called]] the dark side power of [[Death/Legends|deceased]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]] upon Kira and his companions. Kira's group soon found themselves under attack by palace guards, all while under the oppressive pall of the dark side.<ref name=\"beastwars\" /> A [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] [[Laser/Legends|shot]] grazed Kira's [[Limb/Legends|arm]]<ref name=\"audio\" /> as Galia guided them to a secret passage. There, Ulic Qel-Droma realized that they had left his brother, Cay, behind in the palace throne room and instructed Doneeta to escort Kira and Galia back to the ''Nebulon Ranger'' while he tried to save his brother. With all hope of a peaceful solution lost, Kira grabbed his [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and informed his father that the battle had begun.<ref name=\"beastwars\" /> Once the fighting had reached full intensity, Kira left Galia in the safekeeping of Doneeta and joined the Beast Riders in the battle. In the midst of the fighting, Gobee brought Kira a [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]]&mdash;[[Novar (Human)|Novar]], a high-ranking [[minister]] in the Onderonian government. As Kira and Gobee taunted Novar, Amanoa [[Waves of darkness|called down]] the power of the dark side upon the Beast Rider army, filling Kira with feelings of dread and driving him to his knees.<ref name=\"audio\" /> Just as things seemed bleakest, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]] arrived in his starship, the ''[[SunGem]]'', and shifted the advantage toward the Beast Riders with the Jedi [[Force power/Legends|power]] of [[battle meditation]].<ref name=\"beastwars\" /> At that moment, Novar tried to kill the downed Kira with a [[Knife/Legends|knife]], but Kira, now filled with inner strength, caught Novar's knife arm and beat the politician mercilessly.<ref name=\"audio\" /> Her dark power having fled her, the Queen died at the conclusion of the battle, and the Beast Riders were finally victorious. With the dark side's influence gone from Iziz, Kira and Galia had their marriage consecrated under the laws of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and the two warring tribes of Onderon were unified, with Kira as the planet's new king.<ref name=\"beastwars\" />\n\n===War with the Naddists===\n{{Quote|The palace is ''fallen''.

A [[Sith cult/Legends|group]] of dark side followers who worshiped Freedon Nadd had rebelled against Kira's government, placing Onderon into yet another civil war.<ref name=\"nadd1\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 1]]</ref> That year, after a Naddist attack on the Iziz Royal Palace,<ref name=\"audio\" /> Master Arca Jeth ordered that the bodies of Freedon Nadd and Queen Amanoa be removed from Onderon and placed on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]]. Kira and Galia led the darksiders' [[Funeral of Amanoa|funeral procession]], which was also attended by several Jedi, including Jeth, and legions of Iziz [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] and Beast Riders. However, the ceremony was interrupted by a massive [[groundborer]] emerging from beneath the Iziz streets. Hundreds of Naddist [[Troop/Legends|troops]], led by the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]-wielding warrior [[Warb Null]], [[First Battle of Onderon (Naddist Uprising)|attacked]] Kira's men. Although a group of Naddist soldiers went after Galia, Kira and his Beast Riders stood firm and defended her. While Kira's men were able to fend off most of their Naddist attackers, the enemy still was able to get what they had come for&mdash;the [[Sith sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Freedon Nadd and Queen Amanoa. Once in their possession, the Naddists fled the battlefield, returning below Iziz's surface in the groundborer.<ref name=\"nadd1\" />\n\nIn the wake of the battle, Galia, Ulic Qel-Droma, and Jeth went to meet with Galia's father, the former King [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], in his [[Ommin's subterranean fortress|subterranean fortress]], in order to get some answers about the dark pall enveloping the planet. Meanwhile, Kira and the other Jedi stayed behind to secure the Royal Palace. However, the palace was attacked by Naddists, and, despite Kira's best efforts, it soon fell. Galia and Qel-Droma emerged with similarly bad news, as Jeth had been captured by Naddists in Ommin's lair. Knowing that they needed to get out of the city, Kira and Galia left for Kira's fortress beyond the Iziz walls on a [[drexl]] warbeast, with the Jedi following behind. They decided to set up operations at the Kira citadel, and warrior teams were organized and transported there.<ref name=\"nadd1\" /> Kira and his troops soon found themselves surrounded in the citadel by more Naddist forces, but they were aided by some timely reinforcements ordered by Republic [[Minister of Defense (Republic)|Minister of Defense]] [[Netus]], including a Jedi team. Aided by Jedi Knight [[Nomi Sunrider]]'s battle meditation, Kira's forces were able to retake the advantage in the battle. Kira joined the fight alongside his Beast Rider brethren, helping them to repel the Naddist attack on the fortress.<ref name=\"nadd2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]</ref>\n\nThe combined Jedi, Republic, and Beast Rider forces, having fought off the Naddist soldiers at the fortress, took the [[Second Battle of Onderon|fight]] to the enemy stronghold in Iziz. King Ommin was killed when a Jedi team attacked his subterranean fortress, Iziz was retaken, and the bodies of both Freedon Nadd and Queen Amanoa were retrieved. With the Freedon Nadd Uprising suppressed, Kira and Galia ordered that the city of Iziz be placed under martial law and all offworlders present on Onderon be evacuated to their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworlds]]. The [[Freedon Nadd's sarcophagus|sarcophagi of Nadd]] and Amanoa, along with the newly-dead King Ommin, were finally laid to rest in a [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] on Dxun, a ceremony both Kira and Galia attended.<ref name=\"nadd2\" />\n\n===Continued battles===\n{{Quote|We have dealt before with vermin from the skies&hellip; you're no different from the monsters from the Dxun moon!''\"<br />\"''We are different, very different&mdash;for we shall ''conquer''.|Oron Kira and Mandalore the Indomitable, during the defense of Onderon|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Sith War 6}}\n[[File:EnterTheMandalorians.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Oron Kira and Galia witness the early stages of the Mandalorian invasion of Onderon.]]\n[[3997 BBY|One year later]], the Jedi were dealing with yet another dark side threat. A Sith cult known as the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|took power]] in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]] and [[Battle of Deneba|attacked]] a Jedi [[Conclave at Deneba|conclave]] on [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]], resulting in the death of Master Arca Jeth. Ulic Qel-Droma went undercover in the Krath, but, after the realization that he was dangerously close to the dark side, the Jedi decided to organize a team to [[Second Battle of Empress Teta|attack]] the Empress Tetan [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]] and rescue him. Kira and the Beast Riders were called upon to join the Jedi battle force, and the King of Onderon and a Beast Rider army went to meet them on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. The Jedi were still in the preparations phase, and Kira had an idea&mdash;drop the Jedi in on warbeasts, so they could fly to the Krath [[Iron Citadel/Legends|palace]] and retrieve Qel-Droma easier. From there, Kira and the Beast Rider forces [[Transport/Legends|traveled]] along with their warbeasts to Cinnagar. The battle began, and Kira and the Beast Riders [[Ground warfare|fought]] against Krath forces on the ground. Although Ulic Qel-Droma resisted the Jedi attempts to bring him back, his brother, Cay, forcibly removed Ulic from the palace and called for Kira to pick up the wayward Knight. Before Kira could reach Ulic on his warbeast, Nomi Sunrider ordered them to release Ulic, as it was not the Jedi way to take him against his will. With their attempts to rescue Ulic unsuccessful, Kira returned to Onderon.<ref name=\"darklords\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 6]]</ref>\n\nBy [[3996 BBY]], [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] had descended into a state of war. Ulic Qel-Droma, now the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] of Dark Lord [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], led a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] army against the Galactic Republic and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Although the Sith had several early successes in what would come to be known as the Great Sith War, the Republic was able to retake the advantage in the conflict. Late in the war, Sith-loyal [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] forces, led by [[Mandalore the Indomitable]], [[Battle of Onderon (Great Sith War)|attacked]] Onderon and forced Kira to return to battle once again. Kira and Galia were at the Royal Palace when the Mandalorian [[Basilisk war droid/Legends|Basilisk war droids]] surprise-attacked Iziz, and the King of Onderon sprung into action, taking the reins of his drexl warbeast and calling the Beast Rider armies to defend the city. Kira also summoned reinforcements from the Republic, and the Beast Riders had to hold out against the formidable Mandalorian strike force until help reached the planet. Kira was at the forefront of the battle as the primitive Beast Rider technology proved equal to the Mandalorian [[Battle droid/Legends|war droids]]. Finally, a Republic [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] led by [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Orley Vanicus]] arrived to aid the Beast Riders. Although the [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] refused to surrender, Kira and his allies took a decisive advantage and forced the invaders to fall back to the Dxun moon. Mandalore the Indomitable was devoured by the hostile creatures of the moon, and the rest of the Mandalorian forces dispersed. Kira had successfully defended his homeworld, and the Republic eventually claimed victory in the Great Sith War.<ref name=\"sithwar\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 6]]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nBy the time of their descendant [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia's]] reign as queen around [[3951 BBY]], the life and times of both Kira and Galia were common subjects of discussion among the people of Iziz.<ref name=\"kotor2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> Kira's descendants continued to hold the throne of Onderon for thousands of years, until at least [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], when a [[Modon Kira (Galactic Civil War)|man]] named after Kira's father, Modon, held the title of king.<ref name=\"empire's end\">[[Empire's End 2|''Empire's End'' 2]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I doubt we'll ''ever'' see peace, father&hellip; not until Iziz falls!|Oron Kira, to his father, Modon|Tales of the Jedi 2}}\nOron Kira was a fierce warrior with a good [[Heart/Legends|heart]] who worked tirelessly for the overthrow of Iziz. Kira deeply loved his wife, Galia, so much so that he was willing to undertake a highly dangerous mission into the Iziz Royal Palace so he could marry her. Although not a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], Kira hated the dark side and understood its dangers, which he based off the history of Freedon Nadd's subjugation of Onderon and his own grandfather's banishment from Iziz for challenging the dark side regime. Although an experienced warrior, Kira was devoted to creating peace on his home planet in order to end the Beast Wars that had ravaged Onderon for years.
