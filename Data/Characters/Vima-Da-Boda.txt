She spoke in the third person, referring to herself as \"Vima.\"\n\n==Biography==\n===Jedi Knight===\nVima Da-Boda was the great-great-great-granddaughter of [[Vima Sunrider]], daughter of legendary [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] of [[Old Sith Wars|ancient times]] [[Nomi Sunrider]],<ref name=\"EGC\" /> and served [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] for over a century. She was trained by a [[Vima-Da-Boda's Master|male Jedi Master]] who gave her [[Vima-Da-Boda's lightsaber|a lightsaber]]. The [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]] passed through Vima to her daughter, [[Neema-Da-Boda|Neema]], and Vima began to train her daughter in the ways of the Jedi. As with many young pupils, Neema grew frustrated by the slow pace of her Jedi education, and sought alternative training. Neema's impatience and lack of knowledge in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] opened her to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. The dark side consumed Neema, and she left her mother.\n\nYears later, Vima received a telepathic plea from her daughter, who had become the wife of an [[Ottethan warlord]]. Vima rushed to the dungeon to her daughter's aid, but was too late: Neema had been fed to the [[Rancor/Legends|rancors]] of Ottethan. Giving in to her rage, Vima sliced the warlord in half with her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Her desire for vengeance quenched, Vima realized she was succumbing to the dark side herself. Over time, her ability to sense and use the Force slowly faded away, although it is unclear if this was a result of her fall to the dark side or of another cause.\n\n===Hiding===\nWith the onset of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Vima went into hiding on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Her weak connection to the Force coupled with Nar Shaddaa's dense population may have been the key to her survival of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] and the subsequent Jedi eradication efforts.\n\nIn [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]] Vima ran across [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] for the first time and spoke of his future, telling him of [[Mako Spince]]'s betrayal, his joining a cause and becoming a General and his willingness to give up the smuggler's life for [[Leia Organa Solo|the woman he loved]]. He brushed her off then as being insane and forgot her by the next morning.\n\nAt some point between [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] and [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], Vima was imprisoned on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] for an unknown crime or reason. Vima discovered [[Kyp Durron]], a young Human ripe with nascent Force potential. Even with her dulled connection to the Force, Vima could sense the raw, untapped power within Durron. Using what connection she had, Vima taught Durron what minor skills she could before being removed by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] authorities under unknown circumstances.\n\n===Re-emergence===\n[[File:Vima-Da-Boda.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Vima-Da-Boda]]\nBy [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]], Vima had made her way back to Nar Shaddaa. In that year, she sensed the Force presence of [[Leia Organa Solo]]. Detecting what she thought to be a Jedi, Vima explained the tale of her fall and bequeathed to Organa Solo a box containing a 10,000-year-old lightsaber discovered on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] nearly [[850 BBY|900]] years earlier.\n\nAfter the final death of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] on [[Byss/Legends|Byss]], Organa Solo returned to Nar Shaddaa to remove Vima and extract from her knowledge of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]] and the destroyed Jedi Order. Vima, having realized her errors decades earlier, felt unworthy of serving the power she sensed in Organa Solo and the unborn [[Anakin Solo]], but was given little choice after an ambush by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] helped the group escape the clutches of Fett.\n\nEn route to [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]], the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] was forced to hide from Fett in the gas cloud home to [[Empatojayos Brand]]'s ''[[Robida Colossus]]''. Upon their arrival, Vima and Brand aided Skywalker in the training of [[Jem Ysanna]], [[Rayf Ysanna]], and [[Kam Solusar]], the first of Skywalker's Jedi students. The wisdom imparted to Skywalker and his new students would be influential in his decision to found the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. Shortly thereafter, Vima used her healing skills to rid Skywalker of a poison injected into him by [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] agents.<ref name=\"DE2_6_HoD\">[[Dark Empire II 6|''Dark Empire II'' 6]]</ref>\n\nAfter fleeing to [[Nespis VIII]], Leia, who had been hesitant to tap into her Force potential, learned the ways of the Jedi from Vima, including how to shield the newly born Anakin. This skill allowed Organa Solo to save baby Anakin from being possessed by the spirit of Palpatine. Vima, having rekindled her [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] spirit in aiding Organa Solo, Skywalker and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], claimed to be able to feel the flow of the Force once more.\n\n[[File:VimaLuke-CEIII1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vima warns Skywalker about a threat to the New Republic]]\nLittle is known of the fate of Vima after the defeat of Palpatine on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]. For a period, she helped instruct new Jedi recruits at Luke Skywalker's [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], and in [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]] she warned Skywalker about [[Ennix Devian]]. By that time, she had ceased referring to herself in the third person.<ref>[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 1|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 1]]</ref> But after this she seemed to have disappeared.<ref name=\"A Guide to the Star Wars Universe (Third Edition)\">''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVima-Da-Boda was voiced by [[Glynnis Talken Campbell|Glynnis Talken]] in the [[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'']] and [[Dark Empire II (audio)|''Dark Empire II'' audio dramas]].\n\nThe epilogue of ''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]'' stated that Vima disappeared on Onderon in [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]] during the New Republic celebration over the defeat of Palpatine. However, both ''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' and the appendix of ''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' said Vima served as an instructor at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 in her later years.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:VimaDaBodaEGC2.jpg|thumb|150px|Vima-Da-Boda]]\n*''[[Lone Wolf: A Tale of Obi-Wan and Luke]]''\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]\n*[[Dark Empire II 1|''Dark Empire II'' 1]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dark Empire II 2|''Dark Empire II'' 2]]\n*[[Dark Empire II 4|''Dark Empire II'' 4]]\n*[[Dark Empire II 5|''Dark Empire II'' 5]]\n*[[Dark Empire II (audio)|''Dark Empire II'' audio drama]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''\n*''[[Jedi Search]]'' {{Flash}}\n*[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 1|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 1]]\n*[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 5|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 5]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Dark Empire endnotes|''Dark Empire'' endnotes]] {{1stID}}\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|28|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 3}}\n*''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|13|Use the Force|Use the Force: Jedi Trivia Quiz}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 3: Dark Empire]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031002korriban|text=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|int=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|archivedate=20100221224446}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'' {{C|FET32, ''Boba Fett''}}\n*{{FFCite|126|BOD1-2, ''Vima-Da-Boda''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vima-Da-Boda\n|es=Vima-Da-Boda\n|pt=Legends:Vima-Da-Boda\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u043c\u0430-\u0414\u0430-\u0411\u043e\u0434\u0430\n|tr=Vima-Da-Boda\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Da-Boda, Vima}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi healers]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the New Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
