He was the brother of [[Jared Cassel]], who, like Gil, joined the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|There are some things more important than duty... than life...''\"<br />\"''Then let ''both'' of you die as ''traitors''!|Gil Cassel and Darth Maleval|Legacy (2006) 4}}\nGil reached the rank [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] and served in the [[407th Stormtrooper Division]]. His brother, who held the rank of Captain, served in the [[908th Stormtrooper Division]]. During the [[Second Imperial Civil War]], in [[137 ABY]], the 407th remained loyal to the [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Imperial faction]] ruled by [[Darth Krayt]], [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Meanwhile, the 908th, including Jared, defected to the [[Empire-in-exile|side]] of the deposed [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]].\n\n[[File:Gil_Cassel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gil Cassel.]]\n\nAs a result of the defection, the 407th, stationed in [[Yinchorr/Legends|Yinchorr]], was sent to [[Borosk/Legends|Borosk]] to eliminate the 908th to the last man and woman. Despite the presence of his brother in the enemy's side, Gil nonetheless led his troops in [[Battle of Borosk (137 ABY)|battle]].\n\nIn the midst of the battle, with the 407th already winning ground to the 908th, Gil and [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Ran Harkas]] of [[Joker Squad]], discussed the possibility of offering the defecting Division a chance to surrender. However, [[Darth Maleval]], the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] overseeing the 407th on behalf of the Emperor, refused the plan and ordered the complete elimination of the 908th. Despite objections from [[Jes Gistang]] and [[Hondo Karr]], both members of Joker Squad, Lieutenant Cassel chose to follow Lord Maleval's orders.\n\nAfter the 407th's victory, [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Maleval brought the captured Jared Cassel to be executed by Gil as a test of his loyalty to the Sith Empire. However. Gil refused to kill his own brother, for which both were decapitated by the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] Sith Lord.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Legacy (2006) 4|''Legacy'' (2006) 4]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gil Cassel\n|pl=Gil Cassel\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cassel, Gil}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Fel Empire military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
