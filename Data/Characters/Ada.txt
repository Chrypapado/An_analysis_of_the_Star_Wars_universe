As he was unable to make ends meet Davik had him killed and sold Ada into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] to cover the debt. She ended up in servitude to the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], and was gravely mistreated by them, which she described being \"pawed and groped and kicked and spit on\" to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] when he fought his way through the Vulkar base in search of [[Bastila Shan]], encountered Ada, and declared her free. Delighted but nonetheless frightened, Ada fled the compound into the streets. However, her good fortune was cut short when [[Darth Malak]] gave his order to [[Destruction of Taris|bombard]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe player can ask Ada about Bastila Shan and the [[prototype accelerator]]; however, she has information that the player probably already knows.\n\nIf the player follows the dark side, they can kill Ada, saying it's too risky to leave her alive&mdash;although if [[Carth Onasi]] is in the party, he will stay the player's hand.\n\nAda was voiced by [[Tara Strong]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ada\n|nl=Ada\n|pl=Ada\n|fi=Ada\n|ru=Ada\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
