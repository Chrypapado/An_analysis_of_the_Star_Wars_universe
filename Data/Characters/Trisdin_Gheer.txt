When the Queen's [[Dathomirian/Legends|Dathomirian]] daughter-in-law, [[Teneniel Djo]], began to open up the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]] for refugees following the fall of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Trisdin suggested that Ta'a Chume locate and train another young woman to replace Teneniel Djo as the wife of her son, [[Isolder]]. Ta'a Chume and Trisdin formed many plans, including the murder of Teneniel Djo and the grooming of [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] to one day become the new [[Queen Mother]]. Though they were successful in killing Teneniel Djo, the plan to replace her with Jaina was a failure. Trisdin's end came when Jaina manipulated him into releasing the pirate, [[Crimpler]], who killed him before escaping from prison.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Trisdin Gheer\n|es=Trisdin Gheer\n}}\n\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants|Gheer, Trisdin]]\n[[Category:Hapans|Gheer, Trisdin]]\n[[Category:Humans|Gheer, Trisdin]]\n[[Category:Males|Gheer, Trisdin]]"}}}]}}}}
