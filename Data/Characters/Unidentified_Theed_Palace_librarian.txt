That's the right answer. Shall we do another?|The Theed Palace librarian|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA '''librarian''' was employed at a [[Library/Legends|library]] within the [[Theed Royal Palace/Legends|Theed Royal Palace]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. When a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] visited the library during that [[Time/Legends|time]], the librarian offered to play a trivia game with them, which the spacer readily accepted. The librarian asked the spacer a multitude of questions, such as what [[Centerpoint Station|single center of mass]] do both [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] and [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] around, and [[Exar Kun/Legends|who]] formed the [[Brotherhood of the Sith]], among many others. The spacer answered all questions correctly. The librarian, impressed, applauded the spacer's knowledge of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and gave the spacer a badge. The librarian welcomed the spacer to return later, remarking that they might have new questions to ask them.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe \"trivial librarian,\" as they were commonly referred to as in-game, was featured in the [[2003]] [[Wikipedia:MMORPG|massively-multiplayer online role-playing game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']].
