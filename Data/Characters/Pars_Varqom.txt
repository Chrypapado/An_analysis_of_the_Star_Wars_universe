Varqom served as a \"[[Pearl Hat]]\" for 18 years under seven [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|monarchs]], from [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]] to [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Mairayni]].\n\n==Biography==\nVarqom was in service during the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. Having received training in guerrilla tactics from [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Quarsh Panaka/Legends|Quarsh Panaka]], Varqom and his unit retreated from [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] up the [[Solleu River/Legends|Solleu River]] to set up a resistance cell in the [[Penladen Hills]].\n\nWhen [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Queen Amidala]] returned from [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to lead the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|liberation]] of the planet, Varqom and his men were too far away to assist in the raid on Theed. Instead, Panaka ordered them to liberate [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] citizens from the [[Penladen detention camp]]. After disabling the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]] protecting the camp, Varqom witnessed Theed gentry destroying [[B1-Series battle droid]]s with their bare hands as they escaped.\n\nMany years later, Varqom's memoirs were recorded in the 2,453th volume of the [[Royal Archives of Naboo]]. Remembering the Trade Federation's [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]], he still harbored a [[Anti-droid sentiment/Legends|deep distrust]] for [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. In his old age he acquired a degenerative eye condition, but refused to have it treated with [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetics]] as he equated such treatments with droids.\n\n==Personality==\nEver since the Invasion of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], Varqom acquired life-long aversion and mistrust towards droids, going so far as to avoid having a chipped ocular implant for his degenerative [[Eye/Legends|eye]] condition, as recommended by a [[Kulma Narrows]] [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]]. Varqom also boycotted products manufactured by [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidians]], [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] or from corporations that aided both sides of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], such as [[Tagge Company]] and the ones based on [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]] and [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]]. The guard preferred to buy from within the [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]]. His great-granddaughter [[Lesia]] deemed him \"old-fashioned.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Jason Fry]], writer of ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', eventually cut any mentioning of Pars Varqom in the final product. The character was later made [[canon]]ical in the [[StarWars.com]] blog post [[Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut|''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'': Author's Cut, Part 6 &mdash; Showdown at Naboo'']]. For Varqom's story, Fry took inspiraton from [[Wikipedia:World War II|World War II]] veterans he knew who swore to never buy cars made in [[Wikipedia:Japan|Japan]] after the conflict.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{C|Cut}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-6-showdown-at-naboo|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 6: Showdown at Naboo|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}} {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Pars Varqom\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Varqom, Pars}}\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Royal Naboo Security Force personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
