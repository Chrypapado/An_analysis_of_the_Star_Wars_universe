Originally from the planet [[Alderaan]], his family lived on [[Level 3204]] of Coruscant, where following the [[The Disaster|Destruction of Alderaan]] riots took place leading to Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s beginning to arrest or relocate all [[Alderaanian]]s. Santigo and his sister [[Anandra Milon]] fled their [[Milon family apartment|home]] in order to escape arrested, traveling to several other levels of Coruscant in search of help. He and Anandra eventually ended up on [[Level 1997]], where Anandra was offered a job by a [[Pau'an]] [[Unidentified Pau'an drug dealer|criminal]], but had to turn it down as it would mean leaving Santigo alone. The arrival of Imperials then caused the pair to flee down to [[Level 1996]], where Anandra told Santigo to keep running while she held off a [[Unidentified stormtrooper (Level 1997)|stormtrooper]]. The pair reunited after a [[Herglic]] [[Unidentified Herglic criminal|criminal]] [[Death|killed]] the trooper for Anandra, and then made their way to [[Level 1782]] on the Herglic's advice. There they found a small hidden [[Unidentified camp (Level 1782)|camp]] of other Imperial fugitives who they joined.<ref name=\"OTLD\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|151|One Thousand Levels Down}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milon, Santigo}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
