Enough to know he's a Rebel sympathizer.|[[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]] to [[Nima Maas]]|The Hovel on Terk Street}}\n'''Temo Dionisio''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] politician who sympathized with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==Biography==\nDionisio was living on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] some time before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. By that time a young girl named [[Nima Maas]], who was actually an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] agent, worked for him.\n\nHe was wanted dead by the Galactic Empire and Nima was in charge of the mission. However, he was also wanted by [[Nok Derrick]] who kidnapped Temo to gain information about the Rebel Alliance, planning to sell it to the Empire. Nok was torturing him to extract the information when the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]] burst into Derrick's laboratory, killing his [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] guard. He then threw a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] and freed Temo, blowing up the laboratory and Nok Derrick.\n\nNima then appeared and threatened Temo. Greedo attempted to escape, but when Nima threatened him, the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] killed her, saving Temo's life once again.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|6|The Hovel on Terk Street}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|6|Unusual Suspects}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Temo Dionisio\n|pl=Temo Dionisio\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dionisio, Temo}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
