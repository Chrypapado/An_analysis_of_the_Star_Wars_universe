She withdrew her support from [[Kueller]] when she discovered that he had the same weakness as the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], in that he was unwilling to move to rule with an iron fist and crush his opponents when necessary. Kueller broke her neck with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nShe was known to have a death mask collection. She was also known to have her face covered with makeup, designed to look like a less-permanent death mask. She scrubbed it off to show Kueller that she was taking control, and the Dark Jedi killed her by Force-choking her and snapping her neck.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Rebellion]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The New Rebellion (audiobook)|''The New Rebellion'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Femon\n}}\n\n[[Category:Almanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
