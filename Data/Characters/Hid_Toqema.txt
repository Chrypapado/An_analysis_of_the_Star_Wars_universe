The Twi'lek Daedala family, which ran Daedalus, hired nearly one hundred Twi'lek [[Engineer/Legends|engineers]], including Toqema, to work at Friz Harammel as part of a \"cultural unity\" movement from their homeworld.\n\nToqema was involved with the design of thermal gas registers for many years, but as he grew older and slowed down, he was moved to being a maintenance supervisor for a lower sublevel of the gas mines facility. He liked his job, as he found it comfortable and enjoyed not having to listen to others complain about how he worked, but he considered himself more talented and wondered when he would get his management position.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toqema, Hid}}\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
