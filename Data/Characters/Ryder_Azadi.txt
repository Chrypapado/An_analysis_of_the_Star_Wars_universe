He supported the revolutionary broadcasts of [[Lothalite]]s [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]] and [[Mira Bridger]], leading to his arrest and [[Prison|imprisonment]] alongside the Bridgers. While in prison, the former [[Governor]] was labeled as \"'''Prisoner X10'''.\" He escaped four years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], after the Bridgers organized a [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|prison break]]. The Bridgers were [[Death|killed]] during their escape, so Azadi returned to [[Lothal]] to find their son, [[Ezra Bridger]]. Ezra, however, found him first after seeing him and his parents in a [[Force vision|vision]], so Azadi broke the news that his parents had been killed.\n\nAzadi continued helping Bridger's [[Spectres]] rebel cell and [[Phoenix Cell]], which later joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. In the years leading up to the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Azadi became the leader of a [[Lothal resistance group]] group that aided the Alliance against Imperial forces on Lothal. Despite his initial misgiving about Ezra's leadership, Azadi would play an important role in the rebels' efforts to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal from Imperial rule.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|That's what everyone wants to know.

Since Ezra was born on the first [[Empire Day]] (which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' cites as [[19 BBY]]), the ''[[Star Wars: Adventures in Wild Space]]'' series (the books of which take place in close proximity to each other) must be set around [[18 BBY]].</ref> shortly after the Empire arrived on [[Lothal]], [[Governor]] Azadi was instructed to find and capture those responsible for the anti-Imperial transmissions originating from his planet within a month. Despite these instructions from his superiors in the Empire, in reality, Azadi was complicit and at times directly involved in the activities of [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]] and [[Mira Bridger]], the couple creating the broadcasts. When [[Milo Graf|Milo]] and [[Lina Graf|Lina]] [[Graf family|Graf]] were abducted by the [[bounty]] [[Bounty hunter|hunter]] [[Shalla Mondatha]] to be turned over to Imperial [[Captain]] [[Visler Korda]], Azadi was the first person Ephraim Bridger contacted for help in mounting a rescue of the two  [[Youngling|children]].<ref name=\"The Steal\">''[[Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal]]''</ref> Over the course of his association with the [[Bridger family|Bridgers]], he also came to know their son, [[Ezra Bridger]], when he was still just a small child.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n===Attempted takeover of Pryce Mining===\nDuring his tenure as Governor of Lothal, Azadi discovered that a vein of [[doonium]] had been uncovered in the [[Pryce family mine|Pryce Mine]]. Hoping to gain control of the doonium vein before [[Senator]] [[Domus Renking]] and the Empire could get their hands on it, Azadi sent his representative [[Arik Uvis]] to buy a controlling interest from owner [[Arihnda Pryce]]. Pryce, disinterested in letting someone outside of the Pryce family control the mine, turned down Azadi's offer, throwing Uvis out of the mine when he refused to relent.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Pryce_Mining.png|thumb|right|200px|Azadi sent Arik Uvis to attempt a takeover of Pryce Mining.]]\nIn retribution for Pryce's refusal of his offer, Azadi and Uvis falsified embezzlement charges that led to the arrest of [[Elainye Pryce]]. When Pryce went to Renking's office to appeal for her [[Parent|mother's]] release, he confirmed that Elainye would be held by Azadi until proven innocent and he could not be convinced otherwise. Azadi's attempted takeover failed when Pryce turned the mine over to the Empire and Renking in exchange for her mother's release and a job on [[Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Prisoner of the Empire===\n{{Quote|As it happens, that particular governorship may soon be vacant.''\"<br />\"''Governor Azadi is retiring?''\"<br />\"''Yes. Rather against his will, it would seem.|Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Arihnda Pryce|Thrawn (novel)}}\nDespite being a member of the Imperial government, Azadi supported underground revolutionary broadcasts that were made by Ephraim and Mira Bridger. As a result of his actions, Azadi was charged with [[treason]] and incarcerated in an Imperial [[prison]], along with the Bridgers. Azadi was given the label \"[[Prisoner]] X10\" while he was imprisoned.<ref name=\"Legacy\" /> Governor Azadi's \"forced retirement\" and imprisonment coincided with Arihnda Pryce winning [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]'s favor by disclosing the [[Higher Skies Advocacy Group]]'s illegal espionage activities against the Empire and [[Moff]] [[Ghadi]]'s attempt to use this intelligence to gain advantages over Tarkin. As a reward, Pryce was made the new Governor of Lothal. She oversaw the expansion of Imperial industry, mining, and military bases on Lothal, which under her rule became a major center of Imperial power in that region of the galaxy. Azadi's office was looted by his former associates. One of his former ministers [[Maketh Tua]] continued serving Governor Pryce as Lothal's Minister of Industrial Production.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Escape===\n{{Quote|They're dead, aren't they?''\"<br />\"''I'm sorry, son. They are.|Ryder Azadi tells Ezra Bridger what happened to his parents|Legacy (episode)}}\n[[File:Ryder_hosting_Lothal_rebels.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Ryder meeting Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper]]\nIn approximately [[4 BBY]],{{Fact}} the Bridgers' son, Ezra, had become part of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that fought the Empire on Lothal. He sent out a message of rebellion to the people of Lothal, one that also reached the ears of prisoners like Azadi and the Bridgers. This inspired the Bridgers to rally Azadi and fellow inmates to [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|escape]]. Azadi was able to escape from the prison, but the Bridgers [[Death|lost]] their lives during the attempt. Azadi returned to Lothal in the hopes of finding Ezra, so he could tell the boy what happened to his parents, and Ezra likewise traveled to Lothal from [[Garel]] after seeing his parents and Azadi in a [[Force vision|vision]]. Ezra found the former governor in a [[stone circle]] on Lothal, though Azadi did not know who it was at first and fired a [[blaster rifle]] at Ezra and his [[Jedi]] master, [[Kanan Jarrus]].<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nEzra managed to calm Azadi down by telling him that he was the son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. Satisfied, Azadi led Ezra, Kanan, and the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] into the stone circle which served as his adobe. There, the former Governor told Ezra about his connection to his parents. He also informed Ezra that his broadcast had inspired his parents to stage an escape but that they had perished during the attempt. Azadi then stayed inside the stone circle while Ezra went out into the open to grief his parents' deaths. While Ezra was devastated by the loss of his parents, he was able to come to terms with his grief after he encountered them during a Force vision.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n===Helping the rebellion===\n[[File:Ryder_and_the_Lothal_rebels.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Ryder working with the Spectres]]\nRyder stayed behind with Chopper while Ezra and Kanan traveled to the town of [[Jalath]] to greet [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the daughter of the [[Alderaan]]ian Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]], who was delivering three [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvettes]] to the rebellion. Kanan and Ezra had invited him to come along with them but Ryder did not want to expose himself to the Empire. While Ezra and Kanan were away, Ryder and Chopper were captured by a group of [[stormtrooper]]s, who had orders to execute Ryder. Before the Imperials could take their prisoners into the custody, they were ambushed by Ezra, Kanan, Leia, and the other crew of the ''[[Ghost]]''. Following a brief skirmish, Ryder and his rescuers fled aboard the ''Ghost''; with Ezra and Kanan disguised as a kidnapped [[Imperial cadet]] and stormtrooper respectively. To hide Leia's dealings with the rebels, Ryder pretended to \"kidnap\" the [[Alderaanian]] princess.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>\n\nOnce aboard, Ryder was present when the rebels discussed their plans to \"steal\" Leia's corvettes from the Imperials. To hide Alderaan's support for the rebellion, Bail Organa had arranged for the cruisers to be sent to Imperial worlds where they would be \"stolen\" by the rebellion's agents. In response to these \"thefts,\" the Imperials had installed [[gravity lock]]s on them. Since Ryder had worked on building gravity locks during his captivity, he was able to advise the rebels that explosives would not be able to disable them. He then offered the rebels his help in escaping offworld with the [[corvette]]s.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nWith the help of Ryder, the rebels concocted a [[Mission on Lothal|plan]] which involved using the ''[[Phantom]]'', the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' [[VCX-series auxiliary starfighter|auxiliary]] ship, to enter [[Supply Master]] [[Yogar Lyste]]'s [[Lothal Depot|base]]. Still wearing their Imperial disguises, Kanan and Ezra escorted Leia back to the base and claimed to have rescued the Alderaanian princess from the rebels. While the Imperials were distracted, Ryder worked with Chopper and [[Sabine Wren]] to disable the gravity locks on one of the [[cruiser]]s. While Sabine departed on the first corvette, Ryder and Chopper moved to the next ship and proceeded to disable its locks. However, they were discovered by Lyste and several of his stormtroopers. Before any harm could befall Ryder and Chopper, Kanan and Ezra knocked the Imperials out with [[the Force]].<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nDuring the ensuing battle, Ryder watched Kanan using [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]] and quickly realized that the man was a Jedi. Kanan's intervention allowed Ryder and Chopper to disable the second gravity lock; allowing Kanan to [[pilot]] the ship. Realizing that the crew of the ''Ghost'' needed help, he boarded the third ship while Chopper proceeded to disable its gravity lock. Two stormtroopers pursued Ryder but Ezra used the Force to snatch their [[blaster]]s while Leia [[stun]]ned them with her blaster. At the helm of the third Hammerhead corvette, Ryder forced the ship to fly despite the gravity lock by engaging the thrusters, toppling an [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walker]] in the process. Ryder then escaped with the other rebels into [[hyperspace]] with the three stolen corvettes. After realizing that Ezra's parents had inspired a rebel movement, he agreed to join the rebellion and free Lothal to honor them and their son.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\n===Sabotaging the Imperial war effort===\n[[File:Marida_Sumar_and_Ryder_Azadi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ryder and Marida attacking the Lothal Imperial factory.]]\nBy [[2 BBY]], Ryder Azadi had become the leader of a [[Lothal resistance group|rebel cell]] on Lothal that specialized in sabotaging vehicles being produced at the [[Imperial Armory Complex]]. His fellow operatives included the former farmer [[Morad Sumar]] and his wife [[Marida Sumar]], and the [[Ithorian]] bartender [[Jho]]. When the [[Phoenix Cell]] received intelligence that the Empire was developing a new weapon, Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper arranged to rendezvous with Ryder in [[Capital City]]. The Phoenix Squadron wanted to take out the factory but needed the help of a local rebel cell.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nRyder drove his [[landspeeder]] into Capital City but was quickly pursued by two [[scout trooper]]s on [[614-AvA speeder bike]]s and an [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walker]]. Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper managed to jump into Ryder's speeder and the rebels fled for the highway. On the way, they narrowly ran into an Imperial road block and Ryder was forced to do a U-turn. Ezra and Kanan managed to use their lightsabers to cut down the AT-DP walker's legs. Ryder then led the speeder bikes on a chase through the highway. After telling the Spectres about his cell's work as saboteurs, Ryder reassured his comrades that the speeder bikes could not go beyond 190 km/h. True to his word, the speeder bikes exploded and crashed.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nRyder then drove the rebels to his hideout at a stone circle in Lothal's wilderness. There, they were joined by the Sumars and Jho. Ryder discussed the details of the Phoenix Squadron's plan with Ezra and Kanan. Morad agreed to help Ezra and his team infiltrate the factory disguised as workers and an [[R4 courier droid|Imperial courier droid]] respectively. The mission was complicated by a surprise inspection by the [[Chiss]] [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], who had been sent by [[Imperial High Command]] to investigate the high rate of defective vehicles at the Lothal Imperial factory. Thrawn staged a dangerous test demonstration on a 614-AvA speeder bike that claimed Morad's life.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nKanan tried to contact Ryder but found that the Imperials were jamming all [[comlink]]s. Meanwhile, Ryder contacted [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] via [[hologram]] to warn them that the Imperials had locked down the factory. Ryder described the new Imperial officer as pretty thorough and having red eyes. Hera quickly recognized the officer as Grand Admiral Thrawn, whom she had encountered on [[Ryloth]]. Ryder then told Hera that he and his team would attack the factory's east gate to facilitate Ezra and his team's escape.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nWith the help of the disillusioned [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], Kanan managed to use a communication port to upload his comlink signals to Ryder. Ryder then told Kanan that he and his team were at the east gate and were ready to evacuate their team. Ryder remained in his landspeeder while Marida used a rocket launcher to damage an [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]]. The rebels then came under attack from two AT-AT walkers. Ryder and Marida watched as Ezra's team exited the factory in AT-DP [[Walker 216]]. When one of the AT-AT walkers proceeded to crush the rebel walker, Marida fired a rocket that hit the walker's foreleg.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nRyder expressed a humored surprise when he saw Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper exit the walker that Marida had shot down. When Ryder asked about Morad, Ezra informed him and Marida that the rebel had not survived the mission. Back at Ryder's base, Chopper uploaded the plans to the [[Chopper Base|rebel base]] on the planet [[Atollon]]. After Sabine decrypted the plan, Ryder and the Spectres learnt that these contained the blue prints for Thrawn's [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|new starfighter initiative]]. The rebels feared that the Empire would use these new [[deflector shield]]-equipped starfighters to destroy the rebellion.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n===Mon Mothma's speech===\nLater, Ryder Azadi along with his fellow rebel operatives Old Jho and Marida Sumar were frequenting [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]] when the rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] delivered a speech on [[HoloNet]] urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n===Battle of Atollon===\nPrior to the Phoenix Squadron and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]]'s planned assault on the TIE Defender factories on Lothal, Ryder corresponded with his rebel comrades via hologram and informed them that most of the Imperial fleet had left Lothal. As a result, Hera realized that Thrawn had discovered the location of Chopper Base and Atollon. Shortly later, Ryder's transmission was cut off as the Imperial fleet began jamming long-range transmissions. This preceded the [[Battle of Atollon]], which saw the rebels sustain heavy casualties at the hands of Grand Admiral Thrawn's [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\n===TIE Defender Elite heist===\nEven though Lothal was now heavily occupied by Imperial forces and the planet was suffering due to heavy mining by the Mining Guild, Ryder and his rebels continued to fight against the Imperials. He requested assistance from Rebel high command upon hearing of a new [[TIE/D Defender Elite|fighter]] being built in Lothal. During this time, he sent his fellow rebel comrade [[Jai Kell]] to what was once Old Jho's Pit Stop, to see if help arrived. Ryder's cell was also targeted by an [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|Imperial crackdown]] which claimed the life of Jho.<ref name=\"The Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>\n\nRebel high command eventually received his transmission, and sent help in the form of the Spectres. Jai encountered Ezra and Sabine, and after reconnecting with the other Spectres, they made their way to the sewer system, following the starbirds that were painted there. Ryder narrowly saved the group from being surrounded and captured by the Empire, and was surprised that his message got through, and that only the Spectres were given to him. Ezra assured him that they will free Lothal, as rebellions always start small. While Ryder understood Ezra's sentiments, he replied that the feeling will be gone when they see the new prototype fighter the Empire is designing.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\nRyder later accompanied the Spectres to scout the Elite, and when the mission escalated into an encounter with Thrawn, Ryder became concerned with Ezra and Sabine's safety, but was reassured by Zeb that they would be fine. The two later made their way back to Ryder and the others, and they returned to his camp.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref> The following day, the rebels obtained the hyperdrive from the stolen TIE Defender Elite and installed it into Ryder's [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]]. Shortly later, the camp was eventually found due to the [[Noghri]] assassin [[Rukh]] tracking them back to base. While Hera Syndulla and Chopper returned with the Defender's flight data recorder to [[Yavin 4]], Ryder and his rebels managed to escape due to the help of several [[Loth-wolf|Loth-wolves]], who brought the group from the northern to the southern hemisphere.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\n===Continuing the fight===\nRyder and his rebel cell later set up their new camp in the caves that the Loth-wolves brought them into. He later brings Ezra, Kanan, and Zeb to a nearby [[Mining Guild]] [[ore crawler]], which they boarded. The rebels encountered several indentured civilians including the [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]], who had smuggled the Spectres into Lothal. Besides subduing the [[Trandoshan]] overseers [[Proach]] and [[Seevor]], the rebels also narrowly escaped an Imperial search party. After liberating the prisoners, the rebels managed to get a connection to Hera, who informs them that Rebel high command is sending an attack force to Lothal to destroy the factories and fuel depots, cheering the rebels up.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Attack on Lothal]], Ryder, his cell, and the Spectres sabotaged several towers housing turrets that were being used to defend the factory where the Elites were being manufactured so rebel fighters could bombard it. Out of range of the factory, they watched several fighters crash in and around the city, and realized that the strike force had been destroyed. Ryder became saddened by the turn of events, and when Sabine informed them that several gunships were coming, Ryder told the group that they needed to leave before they were found.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>\n\n===Kanan's death===\nAfter the failed attack, Ryder, [[Mart Mattin]], and Jai Kell watched as the Spectres built several [[Loth-bat glider]]s. He remained at the rebel camp while the Spectres mounted a [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|mission]] to the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]] to rescue their leader Hera Syndulla. During the course of the mission, Kanan was killed when Governor Pryce blew up the [[Lothal City fuel depot]] in an attempt to kill the rebels.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Kanan's death, Ryder along with Mart and Jai Kell were listening to a [[propaganda]] broadcast by [[Alton Kastle]], who claimed that the rebellion on Lothal was over and that their leadership had been crushed. When Ryder advocated contacting [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]] for reinforcements, Ezra told him that the fight on Lothal was over and that Mon Mothma would not commit anymore resources. Ryder the asked Hera what their next move should be. However, Hera was grief-stricken due to the death of Kanan. The rebels subsequently learned that Kanan's death had not been in vain and that the destruction of the fuel depot had knocked out Thrawn's TIE Defender factory on Lothal.<ref name=\"DUME\">{{Rebels|DUME}}</ref>\n\n===Trapping Governor Pryce===\nFollowing the Spectres' [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|mission]] to the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]], Ryder and several other rebels including Sabine, Zeb, and Mart Mattin attended a meeting where Ezra outlined their plan to take Capital City from the Empire before Grand Admiral Thrawn returned to Lothal. Cognizant of the failure of Hera's last attack, Ryder thought that the Lothal resistance had little chance of success against Thrawn. He argued that their best course of action was to stay low, reorganize, and rebuild their forces. When Ezra asked Ryder to trust him, Ryder countered that they needed an army to retake Lothal. Ezra responded that they only needed one person.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>\n\nUnder Ezra's instructions, Ryder contacted Governor Pryce and offered to sell her the coordinates of the Lothal resistance base in return for escaping imprisonment. Since Pryce was desperate to curry favor with Thrawn, she took the bait. As planned, Governor Pryce led a force of [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transports]] and stormtroopers to the Lothal cliff dwelling that served as the Lothal resistance base. When the Noghri tracker Rukh entered the camp, Ryder took care not to shoot him in order to perpetuate the ruse that he was a traitor. Despite stiff resistance, Pryce succeeded in cornering the Lothal rebels and Spectres on top of a Mining Guild ore crawler.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\nAfter Pryce's forces had captured the rebels, the Governor praised Ryder for bringing peace to Lothal. When Sabine feigned anger at Ryder, he claimed that they needed an army to retake Lothal. When Pryce gloated over her victory, Ryder revealed that this was a ruse to lure Pryce into a trap. Shortly later, Hera returned with several reinforcements including the former [[Clone trooper]]s [[Gregor]], [[Wolffe]], the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], the [[Ugnaught]] [[Melch]], and the former Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus. Hera shot down Pryce's remaining gunships while Pryce's forces were overwhelmed by loth-wolves. The rebels then took Pryce and her surviving troops prisoner.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\n===Liberating Lothal===\nPrior to the assault on the Dome, Ryder and Kallus brought the captive Pryce before Ezra, who used the [[White Loth-wolf]] to force her cooperation in their plan to infiltrate the Dome, the center of Imperial power on Lothal which turned out to be a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. The rebels then traveled in two patrol transports to the Dome, using Pryce's access codes to gain landing rights. Following a brief skirmish, the rebels managed to capture the command center.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\nAfter capturing the command center, Ryder assisted Ezra and Kallus' plan to initiate a faux [[Protocol 13]]. As a result, the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal evacuated aboard the Dome. When an Imperial officer expressed doubt, Ryder impersonated Imperial Security Bureau [[Colonel]] [[Wullf Yularen]] and ensured his compliance. Before the rebels could fire off the Dome's thrusters, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera'' and blocked their path.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nThrawn managed to force Ezra to come to him to discuss an unconditional surrender by bombarding Capital City. In Ezra's absence, the rebels adopted Sabine's plan to send two strike teams to recapture the northern and southern power terminals in order to reactivate the shield generators. Ryder remained with Hera, Sabine, and the captive Pryce in the command center for the duration of the fighting.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nAfter Ezra used a pod of [[purrgil]] to carry himself, Thrawn, and the ''Chimaera'' into uncharted space, the rebels completed their mission to fire up the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. Before the rebels detonated the Imperial base, Ryder tried to reconcile with Pryce and offered her the opportunity of coming with them. Pryce however rejected his overtures and perished when the Dome exploded. Ryder and the rebels evacuated aboard the ''Ghost''. Due to their efforts, Ryder and his rebel comrades succeeded in expelling the Empire from Lothal, allowing the planet and its people to recover.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Ryder_Azadi.png|thumb|right|200px|Azadi during his refuge on Lothal]]\nRyder Azadi was a [[human]] male with [[Color|white]] [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and copper skin. While serving as Imperial governor, Azadi coveted the [[Pryce family]]'s [[Pryce Mining]] company. When Arihnda Pryce refused to let him buy a controlling stake in the family's company, Azadi framed her mother Elainye for embezzlement. While Pryce avoided Azadi's takeover by selling the company to the Empire, Azadi's actions earned him the enmity of Arihnda.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThough he served as an Imperial governor, he supported the revolutionary broadcasts made by Ephraim and Mira Bridger, a decision that led to him being charged with treason and incarcerated in an Imperial prison.<ref name=\"Legacy\" /> Time spent in Imperial prison had wearied Azadi. Following his escape, he initially wanted no part in rebellious activities, fearing that any such involvement might land him back in prison, a fate he could not bear. He agreed reluctantly only to assist for one mission, feeling that he owed the rebels for his rescue. Participating in this rekindled his spark for resistance against the Empire's activities and he joined up to continue fighting.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nRyder later used his knowledge of Capital City<ref name=\"The Occupation\" /> and Lothal's natural landscape to help the Spectres undertake a mission to disrupt the Empire's TIE Defender manufacturing operations on Lothal.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> Ryder also owned a U-wing, which he lent to Hera in order for her to escape Lothal with the TIE/D Defender Elite's [[flight data recorder]].<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\nRyder was also capable of deception and used his guile to trick Governor Pryce into sending her forces into a trap at the Lothal cliff dwelling. Ryder appealed to her desire to please Thrawn and depicted himself as a self-interested opportunist wanting to save his own skin.
