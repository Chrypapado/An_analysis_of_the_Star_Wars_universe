He followed the expected career path and joined the Guard himself, becoming one of their best [[Officer/Legends|officers]]. When he found his brother [[Venco Autem]], also a Senate Guard, taking bribes, he turned in Venco due to his extremely strong sense of duty, service, and honor. Autem's dedication to his work and the Republic took a toll on his family, however, distancing his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] [[Sula Autem|Sula]] and making his son [[Reymet Autem|Reymet]] resentful. Shortly before [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], when Autem was assigned to investigate the [[Death/Legends|murder]] of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Jheramahd Greyshade]], he discovered that Venco was the mastermind of the [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]], and that Reymet had unknowingly aided him. Autem shot and killed his brother in the line of duty, but Venco's condemnation of the Republic's corruption shook Autem's faith in his government. His wife left him, and he drew his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on his partner, [[Isaru Omin]], rather than allow him to take Reymet in.\n\nAutem left the Senate Guard in disgrace and began a career as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] before he was [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] on [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] for an operation gone bad. In the midst of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] freed Autem and a handful of other [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] to aid her in infiltrating the [[Shogar Tok's fortress|fortress]] of a [[Shogar Tok|Separatist leader]]. With Autem's aid, Ti and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] won the [[Battle of Brentaal IV (Clone Wars)|Battle of Brentaal IV]], and Autem earned a Republic pardon. Not long thereafter, he gave in to his sense of duty and became an [[Republic officer/Legends|officer]] in the [[Republic Navy]]. He served in the [[Fleet/Legends|Fleet]] for two [[Standard year/Legends|years]], helping end the [[Siege of Saleucami/Legends|Siege of Saleucami]], for which he was later hailed as a hero. When the Republic [[Declaration of a New Order|became]] the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] at the [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|end]] of the war, Autem was marked for execution and barely escaped Imperial agents with his life, due to the efforts of his old partner Isaru Omin and the aid of Reymet, who had returned to Coruscant under the guise of a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. Reunited with Reymet, Autem set out for the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] to join his family and start a new life.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n{{Quote|I've ''made'' my name!

His [[Sagoro Autem's father|father]] and [[Sagoro Autem's grandfather|grandfather]] were both [[Senate Guard/Legends|Senate Guards]], elite protectors of the Republic's [[Galactic Senate/Legends|legislators]].<ref name=\"Databank\">{{DB|character|sagoroautem|Autem, Sagoro|archivedate=20100830071222}}</ref> While growing up on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Autem naturally joined the Senate Guard himself, graduating from the [[Senate Guard Academy]] and beginning a dedicated career,<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> just as his older brother, [[Venco Autem|Venco]], already had.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 2\">[[Republic 47|''Republic'' 47]]</ref>\n\nAutem was a skilled Guard with a reputation for honesty, efficiency, and talent. He was partnered with [[Zalin Bey]] until she was promoted to the rank of [[Commander/Legends|commander]]; the promotion could have been Autem's, but he declined, wishing to remain active rather than take a desk job.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> Nevertheless, he was a talented [[Detective/Legends|investigator]] and had the skills for the job.<ref name=\"Databank\" /><ref name=\"WOTC\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030213sagoro|text=Sagoro Autem|int=Sagoro Autem (article)|archivedate=20091016054533}}</ref> After Bey's promotion, Autem gained a new partner, [[Isaru Omin]]. Omin, a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] who had been rejected by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] due to having been too old when discovered by a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] scout, maintained a close working relationship with Autem and served as a confidante.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" />\n\n[[File:Autem_Family.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Autem in a family argument]]\nAt some point during his career, Autem found that Venco, also considered one of the Guard's best, had been taking bribes. Autem refused to allow family ties to get in the way of duty and turned his brother in to the authorities, whereupon Venco was convicted and [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]]. Ever after that, Autem effectively disowned Venco, despising him as a corrupt man who had betrayed his oath to the Republic and sullied the Autem family name.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 2\" />\n\nDuring his early career, Autem met a woman named [[Sula Autem|Sula]], whose family also included multiple Senate Guards. They fell in love and [[Marriage/Legends|married]], producing two children: Reymet<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" />&mdash;born in [[42 BBY/Legends|42 BBY]]<ref name=\"HoloNet News\">{{Hnn|56|news/13516_5.html|Senate Speeder Thief Arrested|https://web.archive.org/web/20130831142029/http://www.holonetnews.com:80/56/news/13516_5.html}}</ref>&mdash;and [[Lissa Autem|Lissa]], born later. Autem loved his family but was frequently absent due to his job,<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> and he made it clear that he placed the Republic over all other loyalties, including family.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> In addition, he held his family to his own strict standards of loyalty, discipline, and service. Sula grew to find him distant and unloving, and Reymet, who enrolled in the Senate Guard Academy due to family pressure but held no desire to be a Guard himself, resented his [[Parent/Legends|father's]] absence, strictness, and extremely high standards. Reymet frequently engaged in risky behavior, such as illegal [[pit racing]], and Autem furiously upbraided his son for behavior that could get him kicked out the Academy, regarding him as unmotivated and immature&mdash;and in moments of great frustration, idiotic.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" />\n\n===The Greyshade case===\n{{Quote|Your Republic is corrupt and dying, Sagoro&mdash;just like my body.

Greyshade would have been a key vote on the upcoming [[Financial Reform Act]], which intended to address and reduce the corruption prevalent in the Republic, and Autem was reluctant to take on such a [[Politics/Legends|politically]] sensitive case. However, Bey, now his direct superior, felt that Autem and Omin were the men for the job. They reported to the office of [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] himself, where Palpatine introduced them as some of the Guard's \"most valued members\" to Senator [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]], Jheramahd's cousin and his appointed replacement. Palpatine assigned the pair of Senate Guards to investigate Jheramahd's [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] and track down the culprits, while [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his maverick [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] would provide security for Simon Greyshade. Greyshade had requested Jedi protection, but Autem was offended, as the protection of senators was traditionally the duty of the Senate Guard. Palpatine cited the swiftly upcoming bill, which could have a profound influence on the emerging [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]], as creating a need for extraordinary measures, and Autem could do little but accept the situation despite his dislike of Jedi and their mystical ways.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" />\n\n[[File:Autem-Omin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Autem, left, and his partner Isaru Omin in the Supreme Chancellor's office]]\nAt the close of the meeting, Autem received a call from Sula. Reymet was pit racing once more, and this [[Time/Legends|time]] he had taken Lissa with him to watch. Autem knew that a [[Judicial Department/Legends|Judicial]] raid on the [[Garbage pit|pits]] was planned, and that if Reymet were caught, he would be expelled from the Academy. Autem was unaware that Reymet had in fact already been suspended from the Academy. Autem took Omin with him to the races, where they filtered through the crowd incognito. Reymet was in the air when they arrived, however, and the Judicial raid occurred during his flight. Autem and Omin were unable to get Lissa and Reymet out beforehand, and Reymet attacked a Judicial [[Officer/Legends|officer]] after the officer [[Stun/Legends|stunned]] [[Riao Siao]], Reymet's [[Felacatian]] girlfriend, when she resisted arrest. Autem and Omin revealed themselves as Senate Guards and were able to claim priority on Reymet and Lissa, taking them out of custody and freeing them upon their departure from the garbage pit. Autem declined to take Siao, though, whom he despised as enabling his son's irresponsible behavior.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" />\n\nAutem harshly reprimanded his son when he brought him home, telling him his behavior was foolish and risky, and demanding that he buckle down and attend to his studies in the Academy. Sula came to Reymet's defense, but the argument was interrupted by the arrival at their door of Venco Autem,<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> recently released from prison. Autem berated his brother, but was brought up short when Venco told him that he was dying. Autem invited him inside, where Venco informed him that he had an incurable disease. Autem's anger swiftly returned, however, and he dismissed Venco's illness as a possible ploy that would not redeem him from his crimes even if true. When Omin [[Comlink/Legends|commed]] Autem with new developments in the case, Autem turned his brother out of the house as he himself left; Reymet was offended at such treatment of his uncle, whom he rather liked, and Sula despaired at Autem's cold and harsh demeanor.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 2\" />\n\nAutem reported to Greyshade's apartment in the [[500 Republica/Legends|500 Republica]] building, where a pair of modified [[Droid/Legends|droids]] had attempted to assassinate the Senator, only to be foiled by his Jedi [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]]. Skywalker analyzed one of the destroyed droids&mdash;a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]]&mdash;and found a strange [[Subspace transceiver|transceiver]]. Omin and Autem took the transceiver back to the Senate Guard forensic [[Laboratory/Legends|laboratories]] for analysis; Omin also reported that a scan of the droid's memory had revealed that it had been shut down an [[Standard hour/Legends|hour]] before Jheramahd Greyshade's death, which they believed suggested he had been meeting with a shady character. Analysis of the transceiver established a link to [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Tsian]], who had a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] link capable of interfacing with droids; cross-checking her travel history showed multiple unsolved assassinations which corresponded with her visits to various planets. Furthermore, she was currently attending a party in honor of the new Senator Greyshade. The Guards tried to get word to Kenobi and Skywalker but arrived only after the initial attack was made. Autem stunned Tsian as the Jedi battled a swarm of [[Battle droid/Legends|attack droids]], and her [[Sleep/Legends|unconsciousness]] rendered the droids inoperative. The princess was then taken into custody by the Guard. The Jedi returned Greyshade to his apartments, but on their way were attacked by the [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] assassin [[Keluda]]. Kenobi captured Keluda and extracted from him the name of his employer: Venco Autem.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 2\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to Autem, Venco had bribed a prison guard to release Riao from jail, which had impressed Reymet and allowed Venco to manipulate the boy into giving his uncle his Senate Guard access codes. As Reymet's codes had been invalidated due to his suspension from the Academy, he gave Venco his father's access codes, which Autem was unaware that his son knew.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 2\" />\n\nWith Venco's name revealed as the mastermind of the assassinations, Autem was taken off the case and sent home. Such inactivity&mdash;especially when it was his brother causing the problems&mdash;was not Autem's way, however, and he considered himself most likely to be able to take down his brother, who had been one of the Senate Guard's best. Autem stopped by his home, where he found Reymet preparing to leave for Siao's [[Felacat|homeworld]] with her, a trip organized by Venco. When Reymet mentioned speaking with Venco, Autem demanded to know where Venco was. When told of Venco's complicity in the assassination attempts, Reymet revealed all that had transpired. Autem commed Omin with the news that Venco had his access codes, but Omin was busy due to a breakout attempt by Tsian, who had, with assistance from Venco, taken over several droids' [[Programmer/Legends|programming]] and was creating a distraction for Venco.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 3\">[[Republic 48|''Republic'' 48]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Autem_Showdown.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Autem battles his brother in the Senate Rotunda.]]\nAutem swiftly made his way to the [[Senate Building]]'s [[Grand Convocation Chamber]], where he arrived just in time to draw a blaster on Venco, who had disguised himself as Greyshade's personal Senate Guard. Venco detached Greyshade's [[Repulsorpod/Legends|repulsorpod]] and moved to the center of the chamber, but Autem, in an overlooking pod, did the same with his. Autem ordered Venco to surrender, but Venco told his brother that he was in fact dying, and didn't care about escape. His prison time had changed him into a believer determined to bring down what he saw as a hopelessly corrupt Republic. Autem pointed out that he served not the men, but the principles of the Republic. In the end, the two stared each other down, weapons at their sides, before Autem suddenly raised his blaster and killed his brother.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 3\" />\n\n===Loss of faith===\n{{Quote|I'm sorry, partner. The Republic's not worth it. Maybe it never was.|Sagoro Autem, to Isaru Omin|Republic 48}}\nIn conversation with Chancellor Palpatine about the case, Autem covered up for his son, acting as if he didn't know how Venco had accessed his codes. Meanwhile, Autem received a [[holograph]]ic message from Sula, telling him that Reymet was leaving the planet with Riao and that she was taking Lissa and leaving Autem. She also asked him not to interfere with any of them. With his faith in the Republic shattered by Venco's accusations of its corruption and his life ruined by the breakup of his family, Autem acquired a new sense of priorities. When he and Omin went to arrest Reymet&mdash;wanted for questioning as an accessory to murder&mdash;Autem refused to go through with it. Omin offered to keep him from having to arrest his own son by doing it himself, but Autem drew a blaster on his partner, telling him that he wouldn't let the Republic take any more of his family. Omin reluctantly took Autem himself into custody for his actions, refusing to make allowances for his actions. With Reymet safely off-world, Autem quietly complied.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 3\" />\n\n[[File:Sagoro02.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Sagoro Autem, mercenary]]\nAutem was made to answer for his decisions and ultimately departed from the service. Later in his life, he claimed that he left by his own will.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\">''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]''</ref> He retained the respect of many former colleagues, but continued to resent Omin for turning him in, which he regarded as a betrayal.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" /> He turned his skills to work as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]], looking for his family at the same time, though he found no trace.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" /><ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" /> Autem continued in this vein for some time until, during a job with a [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]], the Devaronian betrayed him and left him for the authorities. He was convicted by the Republic and, by the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in 22 BBY, was locked in [[Brentaal IV prison|prison]] on the planet [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]].<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" /> That year, a [[HoloNet News/Legends|HoloNet News]] story on the theft of Simon Greyshade's speeder reported that Reymet Autem had been arrested as the thief&mdash;though in fact Anakin Skywalker had \"borrowed\" it during the pursuit of the assassin [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]]. The report named Sagoro Autem as Greyshade's designated guard at the time and cited Reymet as claiming to have visited his father at Greyshade's residence earlier that day.<ref name=\"HoloNet News\" />\n\n===The Battle of Brentaal IV===\n{{Dialogue|Vos|Our infiltration team's a little ''thin'', Master Ti&mdash;you, me, and a clone.|Ti|I'm accepting these three others as ''volunteers''.|Autem|<nowiki></nowiki>''What?!''

''They'' put us in this jail!|attr=Quinlan Vos, Shaak Ti, and Sagoro Autem|src=Jedi: Shaak Ti}}\nAround five [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the Clone Wars opened, [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] leader [[Shogar Tok]] led an insurrection on Brentaal IV, taking over Autem's prison in the process. This was followed by a Republic [[Battle of Brentaal IV (Clone Wars)|counterattack]] under four [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi Generals]]. Autem and his fellow [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] took advantage of the battle to stage a prison riot. While Autem, the [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] [[Lyshaa]], and the grief-crazed [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Ryyk (Wookiee)|Ryyk]] furiously battled Tok's guards, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] and a group of Republic [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] soon afterward arrived at the prison, where they hoped to take refuge after the Republic forces were devastated by a set of [[Deflector shield/Legends|shielded]] [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannons]] that they had believed to be disabled.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\n[[File:Autem_Firing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Autem battles Shogar Tok's forces during the Battle of Brentaal IV.]]\nWith the aid of Ti and her [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]], Autem and the others defeated the prison guards, although several of the [[Troop/Legends|troopers]] were killed. Also in the prison was Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] for the Republic in solitary confinement under the alias Korto [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Vos]], who was rescued by Ti. Autem, Lyshaa, and Ryyk were conscripted by Ti to join her, Vos, and the [[Unidentified clone trooper (Brentaal IV)|single surviving clone]] in infiltrating [[Shogar Tok's fortress]]. When Autem and Lyshaa objected, Ti promised them their freedom in exchange for their assistance. The three prisoners thus agreed.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\nThey set off through the sewers to access Tok's fortress, where they found a [[Scrange/Legends|scrange]]. During battle with the beast, Ryyk was killed, reducing the infiltration team even further. Once out of the sewers, the team split up, with Ti and Lyshaa departing to capture Tok, the [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] being assigned to destroy the fortress's [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]], and Vos and Autem aiming to destroy the [[Magna-gun|ion cannon]]. The success of even one group would allow the forces of Jedi Master [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]]&mdash;who had withdrawn from [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] following the surprise ion [[Cannon/Legends|cannon]] attack&mdash;to score a victory when they returned four hours after their departure to renew the attack.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\nThe forces of Jedi Master [[Agen Kolar/Legends|Agen Kolar]], who had allowed himself to be captured, were being processed and imprisoned, rendering the fortress was a flurry of activity. Vos was discouraged by this, but Autem saw it as an opportunity. Vos and Autem, whose clothing was little different from the informal gear of Tok's troopers, approached a security checkpoint masquerading as captors of the clone trooper. Autem was able to use his knowledge of guard customs to belligerently bluster past the checkpoint when his authorization was questioned; afterward, he revealed to Vos that he had been a Senate Guard. After this checkpoint, the clone split off.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\nAutem and Vos were able to reach their target, and Autem stood guard while Vos rewired the guns to overload their power supply. Just as Vos finished, however, Tok's guards arrived and captured the [[Saboteur/Legends|saboteurs]]. They discovered the first layer of Vos's sabotage and undid it, but a backup layer went off, destroying the cannons. Meanwhile, the clone gave his life to destroy the shield generator, and Ti captured Tok despite treachery from Lyshaa. Vos used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Telekinesis/Legends|disarm]] his and Autem's captors, blowing his cover and revealing himself as a Jedi, much to the dismay of Autem, who still considered Jedi a bad luck charm. Autem and Vos fought their way out, freeing Kolar's captured troopers as Koon attacked. The Separatists were completely routed.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\n===Return to Republic service===\n{{Quote|That planetary gun smacks us anytime we get in range and the center of the city is still covered by their main shield generator.

Though he still disliked Jedi, his attitude had softened somewhat toward them.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" /> Within approximately seven months, Autem had listened to the counsel of an old friend, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]], and joined the war. He signed up with the [[Republic Navy]]; his sense of duty to the Republic ran too deep to abandon it in the midst of a fierce war, even after his earlier disillusionment.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\nBy the last six months of the war, Autem had risen to the rank of captain, commanding a small [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] from a [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] in orbit over [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]], where [[Senior Jedi General]] [[Oppo Rancisis/Legends|Oppo Rancisis]] and Jedi [[General/Legends|Generals]] Quinlan Vos, [[Ausar Auset]], [[K'Kruhk]], [[Sian Jeisel]], [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]], [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad Hett]], [[Xiaan Amersu]], [[Xeltek]], [[Durnar]], and [[T'Bolton]] attempted to take the capital [[City/Legends|city]], where the Separatists were growing an [[Anzat (species)|Anzati]]-trained [[Morgukai Shadow Army|clone army]] of [[Morgukai]]. Autem provided fleet support but was unable to do much directly, as a powerful and well-shielded [[planetary ion cannon]] held his fleet away from the capital. He did, however, develop strong working relationships with the Jedi Generals, including Vos, whom he already knew. When supplies arrived to the fleet from Coruscant, Autem attempted to get them planetside in order to help refugees, but he was only able to get a limited amount to the surface. He reported as much to Master Rancisis via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]].<ref name=\"The Siege of Saleucami 1\">[[Republic 74|''Star Wars: Republic 74: Siege of Saleucami, Part 1'']]</ref>\n\nThe [[Siege of Saleucami/Legends|siege]] continued on this track for five months, killing Xeltek, Durnar, T'Bolton, and Auset before an underground tunnel network was discovered that allowed the Jedi to infiltrate the Separatist compound. Rancisis was then slain by Separatist commander and [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Sora Bulq/Legends|Sora Bulq]], eliminating his [[battle meditation]] and masterful planning from the Republic's forces.<ref name=\"The Siege of Saleucami 2\">[[Republic 75|''Star Wars: Republic 75: Siege of Saleucami, Part 2'']]</ref> Vos instead devised a plan which let Secura and himself infiltrate the compound and sabotage the shields while the other ground and [[Realspace/Legends|space]] forces led a diversionary [[Space warfare|attack]].<ref name=\"The Siege of Saleucami 3\">[[Republic 76|''Star Wars: Republic 76: Siege of Saleucami, Part 3'']]</ref>\n\nVos launched the attack and successfully disabled the shields, but Autem's fleet was still overwhelmed by the ion cannon, which ran off of a separate power source.<ref name=\"The Siege of Saleucami 3\" /> He was near to calling a retreat when Jedi General Xiaan Amersu deliberately crashed her critically damaged [[Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor|starfighter]] into the cannon, sacrificing herself to destroy it.

Two [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] was proclaimed and the Jedi&mdash;enemies of the new government&mdash;[[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|purged]], Autem was summoned to an audience on Coruscant with Palpatine, along with dozens of other captains of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. Autem stood beside his old friend Jan Dodonna, who informed Autem that he had been retroactively credited as \"the\" hero of Saleucami in Imperial [[Propaganda/Legends|propaganda]] now that the Jedi were enemies of the state. Autem did not care for unearned credit, but there was little he could do. Palpatine appeared before the audience, proclaiming the treachery of the Jedi and reinforcing the message of the New Order. He further announced that resignations would not be accepted at the time and that reviews of fitness for command would be conducted. He also introduced his new second-in-command, [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader, who executed Captain [[Jace Dallin]] in order to make an example when Dallin questioned the guilt of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\nAutem was greatly disturbed by these developments. He had never intended to make a career of the Fleet but to stay only for the duration of the crisis, and was less than thrilled by Vader's summary execution of Dallin. Dodonna warned him to watch what he said, however, as the Empire had little toleration for dissent and many willing informers.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\nAutem felt the need for solitude and rented a [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] room instead of returning to his [[Barracks/Legends|barracks]]. He was contemplating his situation when an urgent knock came at the door: his former partner Omin. Autem admitted him, but was bitter and hostile toward Omin for having turned him in five [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before. Omin had vital news, however: the Senate Guard had received a copy of a list of [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officers]] slated for a [[Emperor's purge|purge]], and Autem was among them. No reason was given, but Omin speculated that it could be related to Autem's outspoken character or his criminal history. Regardless, Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] were on their way to arrest Autem. Under the New Order, Omin had a new set of priorities and still considered Autem to be a friend. As Imperial troopers entered the hotel, Autem fled to the roof and from there to the [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant undercity]] while Omin stayed behind to delay the [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]. After Omin was captured and executed by Darth Vader, Vader hired three [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] to find Autem.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\nAutem dodged patrols in the undercity until, taking refuge in a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], he spotted the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Ch'ord Sy'fon]], who owed him a favor. Autem converted that favor into passage off-world aboard the ''[[Scimitar of Kelso]]'' that night at no cost and no questions asked. He lingered until it was time to set out for the [[Starship/Legends|ship]], then began to make his way there. He was ambushed en route by the [[Shistavanen/Legends|Shistavanen]] [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter [[Severian]]. However, Severian was attacked by [[Tartuta]], another one of the bounty hunters. The Dug hoped to steal Severian's kill and [[Dismemberment/Legends|chopped off]] the Shistavanen's hand before sending him plummeting into an urban chasm. Tartuta then turned to Autem, but was taken down by a shot from the third hunter, [[Evan Hessler]]. Hessler remained in the shadows, however, leading Autem to conclude that one of his own stray shots had downed the Dug.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\n[[File:Autem_Reunion.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Autem is reunited with his son.]]\nAutem was nearly at the ''Scimitar''{{'s}} docking bay when he was attacked yet again by Severian, who had recovered from his amputation and fall. Autem was able to stab him to death with one of Tartuta's short blades, which he had appropriated. After that battle, however, he was waylaid a third time, now by Hessler. Hessler held his [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]] to Autem's head and forced him to watch Vader and a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of troopers waiting for him around the transport&mdash;Sy'fon had sold Autem out. Autem was preparing to go out fighting when Hessler took off his mask and revealed himself as none other than Reymet Autem. Reymet had made use of the contacts that Venco had given him to start a career as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]], keeping an [[Eye/Legends|eye]] on his father. He had gotten wind of the termination order and used the Hessler alias to gain the bounty assignment.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\nThe pair boarded the younger Autem's ship and set out for the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], where they planned to go underground and meet up with Sula, who had never truly fallen out of love with Autem, and Lissa, both of whom had remained in contact with Reymet. Autem had escaped, and gained another chance with his family in the process.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Sagoro's a ''good'' man, if a ''bit'' unyielding. He ''means'' well, I'm sure.|Venco Autem, to Reymet Autem|Republic 47}}\nSagoro Autem had light [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], brown eyes, and light skin.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> One of his defining personal characteristics was his exceptional loyalty to the Republic. He was raised in a family with a tradition of service, dedication, and responsibility, and sought to continue that tradition. To him, they were sacred ideals.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" /><ref name=\"Databank\" /> The Republic stood for civilization, order, and justice, and to Autem, it was a proud task to uphold those values.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 3\" /> He placed the Republic above personal concerns&mdash;including his family, though he did sometimes bend rules to protect his son Reymet.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> Autem turned against his brother when he found that Venco had betrayed the Republic, and he also placed his work above more routine commitments to family. He was frequently absent while on cases and caused his wife and son to feel disconnected from him.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /><ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nAutem's faith in the Republic was deeply shaken by Venco's indictment of its corruption. Autem began to realize that the Republic might not have been as great as he had supposed.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 3\" /> Combined with the departure of his wife and children, he rearranged his priorities and placed his family first; by the time of the Clone Wars, his loyalty to the Republic had at least outwardly crumbled. Imprisonment on Brentaal IV made him even more bitter.<ref name=\"Databank\" /><ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" /> However, that spark was never fully extinguished, and Jan Dodonna was able to talk him back into serving his government in a time of crisis. While that sense of duty did not die, it did not remain as strong, with Autem intending only to serve for the length of the crisis rather than restarting a career with the Republic.<ref name=\"Loyalties\" />\n\n[[File:Sagoro_Profile.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Autem could be given to periods of loneliness after the loss of his family.]]\nAutem was also a demanding man who insisted that his family and everyone else live up to his high standards of service. He expected that his family would understand his putting the Republic first and do the same, and he could not understand why Reymet would not want to be a Senate Guard.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> It was not until his family left him that he began to reconsider those standards.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nAnother characteristic of Autem was his dislike of the Jedi Order. He disliked their mystical nature and didn't trust them, putting his faith in traditional detective work over unconfirmable Jedi hunches.<ref name=\"Honor and Duty 1\" /> They were overrated in his opinion, and as likely to impede the proper pursuit of a case as they were to solve it.<ref name=\"WOTC\" /> By the time of Autem's imprisonment, he considered them bad luck, as his cooperation with Jedi on the Greyshade case had not exactly turned out well for him. His rescue by Shaak Ti and Quinlan Vos, however, softened his stance, and Autem began to consider that Jedi, or at least some Jedi individually, might be decent, helpful individuals, though he still did not care for the Jedi overall.<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" /> By the end of the war, Autem was working cooperatively with several Jedi, including Masters Quinlan Vos and Oppo Rancisis, at Saleucami.<ref name=\"The Siege of Saleucami 1\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Sagoro Autem was created by [[John Ostrander]] for use as a protagonist, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, in the ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series story arc [[Star Wars: Republic: Honor and Duty|''Honor and Duty'']]. Ostrander reused Autem as part of the supporting cast in ''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]'' and again in the ''[[Star Wars: Republic: Siege of Saleucami]]'' story arc. [[Republic 78|''Republic'' 78]], also written by Ostrander, was the first issue to feature Autem as the sole protagonist. Currently no author but Ostrander has used the character. In ''Jedi: Shaak Ti'', Sagoro Autem's name is occasionally misspelled as \"Saguro Autem.\"<ref name=\"Jedi: Shaak Ti\" />\n\nThere are various conflicting sources for the time placement of ''Honor and Duty''. The interior covers of the three individual issues state, \"The events in this series take place approximately 23 years prior to ''Star Wars: A New Hope''\" while, within the arc itself, the time frame is clearly identified as eight years after the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]], or [[24 BBY/Legends|24 BBY]]. This later date corresponds with references in ''Loyalties'', which identify the events of ''Honor and Duty'' as being five years earlier than that story, which takes place in 19 BBY. However, the [[Star Wars: Republic: Honor and Duty (TPB)|trade paperback]] of ''Honor and Duty'' and ''Loyalties'' identifies the arc as taking place three years prior to [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], or 22 BBY. The [[StarWars.com]] [[Databank (original)|Databank]] and ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' give yet another time, nine years after the Battle of Naboo or [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], as does ''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''. As yet, no official explanation has been given.\n\nAnother conflict regards Autem's appearance in ''Senate Speeder Thief Arrested'', a story included in [[HoloNet News Vol. 531 56|Volume 531, Issue 56]] on the [[HoloNet News (original website)|HoloNet News website]]. The story takes place in 22 BBY, after the events of ''Honor and Duty'', and claims that Autem is still a Senate Guard and still living with his family. This contradicts the events of ''Honor and Duty'', as well as statements made by Autem in ''Jedi: Shaak Ti''. As the claims in the story are based on statements made by Reymet Autem while under arrest, this article treats them as false testimony.\n\nAutem's eyes are consistently brown-colored in all sources except ''Loyalties'', in which one panel shows him with blue eyes, and in ''Honor and Duty'', in which they generally are brown but are occasionally colored gray, especially in close-ups of his eyes and face.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Honor and Duty]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{Hnn|56|news/13516_5.html|Senate Speeder Thief Arrested|https://web.archive.org/web/20130831142029/http://www.holonetnews.com:80/56/news/13516_5.html}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]''\n*[[Republic 74|''Star Wars: Republic 74: Siege of Saleucami, Part 1'']]\n*[[Republic 76|''Star Wars: Republic 76: Siege of Saleucami, Part 3'']]\n*[[Republic 77|''Star Wars: Republic 77: Siege of Saleucami, Part 4'']]\n*[[Republic 78|''Republic'' 78]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030213sagoro|text=Sagoro Autem|int=Sagoro Autem (article)|archivedate=20091016054533}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030313guard|text=Senate Guard|int=Senate Guard (article)|archivedate=20100327173548}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|sagoroautem|Autem, Sagoro|archivedate=20100830071222}}\n*{{SW|url=news/viva-space-vegas-the-history-of-the-marvelous-wheel-part-2|text=Viva Space Vegas!
