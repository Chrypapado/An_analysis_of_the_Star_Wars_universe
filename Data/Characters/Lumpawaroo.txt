During the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], Waroo and his [[species]] were [[Slavery|enslaved]] by the [[Galactic Empire]]. He and other Wookiee [[Youngling|children]] were forced to work at a slave labor camp run by [[Commandant]] [[Dessard]]. Following the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberation]] of [[Kashyyyk]], Waroo escaped his labor camp. He was pursued by Dessard and his [[Soldier|men]], who caught up with him. However, the Imperials were [[Death|killed]] by a joint party of Wookiees and [[New Republic soldier]]s. Waroo reunited with his father Chewbacca.\n\n==Biography==\nLumpawaroo was the [[Gender|son]] of [[Chewbacca]]<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> and his [[Marriage|wife]] [[Mallatobuck|Malla]].<ref name=\"PSFB\">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> During the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], the [[Wookiee]]s of [[Kashyyyk]] were [[Slavery|enslaved]] by the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Tales\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Lumpawaroo was young, he ventured down into the dangerous depths of Kashyyyk to find [[Wasaka berry|wasaka berries]], which even adult Wookiees were reluctant to do. Chewbacca later recounted the tale, and how he missed his son, to the [[bartender]] [[Tivoche Bilure|Midnight]], who wrote it in his [[Midnight's book|journal]].<ref name=\"Tales\" />\n\nAs a child, Lumpy's mother was taken from him and he was separated from his father. Waroo and other Wookiee children were forced to work as slave laborers at an Imperial child labor camp on the slopes of [[Mount Arayakyak]]. The Imperials prized the Wookiees for their small hands and their ability to climb for high altitudes.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWaroo was a slave for most of his childhood and toiled under the supervision of [[Commandant]] [[Dessard]]. The Empire controlled the Wookiees by using [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] which sounded like a song of fire and terror. On one occasion, Waroo witnessed a female friend dying while trying to scale the walls of the [[daubcrete]] bunker. Following the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberation]] of Kashyyyk by [[New Republic]] forces in [[5 ABY]], the inhibitor chips in Waroo and the other child slaves were disabled. While Dessard and his subordinates managed to reassert their authority by using [[shock-lance]]s and [[blaster]]s, Waroo was encouraged by the demoralized state of the Imperial slave masters.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nDesiring liberty, Waroo made a dash for freedom while Commandant Dessard tried to close the pylon-gate. Waroo fled through the jungle by leaping through trees and branches. However, he came into contact with a [[spore-pod]] that had defoliated much of the surrounding jungle. Dessard and his men caught up with Waroo and prepared to execute him. However, the Imperials were then shot by several adult Wookiees including his father Chewbacca and [[Greybok]], and [[New Republic soldier]]s. Dessard managed to escape the barrage of blaster bolts and was taken prisoner by New Republic soldiers. Waroo recognized his father and the two embraced each other after years of separation.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLumpawaroo was a male Wookiee child who lived during the Age of the Empire. As a slave, he was prized by his Imperial masters for his small hands and ability to climb high. Waroo hated his Imperial captors and nicknamed them \"milk-skins.\" He regarded the signals created by the Imperial inhibitor chips as a song that could drive one insane. He also had a strong sense of smell and could smell his Imperial captors from afar. Waroo took delight in the disabling of the inhibitor chips and the despondent state of his Imperial captors. Waroo once made a desperate dash for freedom. He loved his father Chewbacca and mother Malla. Waroo experienced an emotional reunion with his father following the Liberation of Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> Chewbacca spoke with pride to the bartender Midnight about how Lumpy was good with tools, better than Chewbacca was at that age.<ref name=\"Tales\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Lumpy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lumpawaroo as he appeared in ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'']]\nLumpawaroo first appeared in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] in the [[2017]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]'', written by [[Chuck Wendig]].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> Waroo was originally created for ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', a ''[[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]]'' TV movie released in [[1978]].<ref name=\"Holiday Special\">''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!
