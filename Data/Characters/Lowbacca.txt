He was the nephew of [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], the son of [[Kallabow]] and [[Mahraccor]], and the brother of [[Sirrakuk]]. He studied at [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]] and was a companion of [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], [[Anakin Solo]], [[Zekk]] and [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]]. He wielded a bronze-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLowbacca the [[Wookiee]] was born to [[Kallabow]] and [[Mahraccor]], with his mother [[Kallabow]] being the sister of the famous [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] hero [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. While growing up, he had had two passions: [[Computer/Legends|computer]] science and the study of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk's]] complex plant life. The latter had prompted him to go alone into the dangerous lower levels of his homeworld's forests during his rite of passage to young adulthood, and to pit himself against the deadly [[Syren plant/Legends|syren plant]].\n\nBeing a Wookiee, Lowbacca was a rarity among [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], as [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitives]] were even less common among Wookiees than among other species, one being born only every century or so.\n\n===Second Imperium Crisis===\n[[File:Lowbacca18.jpg|thumb|left|125px|left|Lowbacca and Em Teedee]]\n\nIn [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]] at the age of 19, he went to study at [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]]. Since most of the people Lowbacca would have to interact with were not fluent in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], the [[Wookiee]] trade language, he used a small translator [[Droid/Legends|droid]] that he carried at his waist named [[M-TD|Em Teedee]]. Later in [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]] it was modified to hover, and followed him around flying. He became friends with [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] and [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]]. Jacen had a good sense of humour, and Lowie liked him because of this. Lowbacca's combination of computer skills and biological knowledge, and desire to take on the impossible would make him an invaluable asset to the [[Jedi]].\n\nLowbacca unknowingly set a chain of events in motion when he discovered what eventually turned out to be a derelict [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] in the jungles of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. His new friend Jaina Solo, somewhat envious of Lowbacca's [[T-23 skyhopper]], wanted to repair the TIE Fighter. With the help of Lowbacca, [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], and Tenel Ka, she did, but the friends didn't know that they were being watched by the TIE Fighter's pilot, [[Qorl]]. Eventually he was forced to reveal himself and he took the [[Solo twins]] hostage, forcing them to repair the fighter for him.\n\nLowbacca ran away to his [[Skyhopper/Legends|skyhopper]], and returned with it in an attempt to intimidate Qorl into running away. However, [[Qorl]] called his bluff and critically damaged the [[airspeeder]], forcing Lowbacca to abandon it in the jungle. Lowbacca tore through the jungle on foot for the Praxeum, losing [[M-TD|Em Teedee]] in the process. Once he got there, he couldn't communicate with anyone. He then remembered that his uncle and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] were still in the system and within communicator range, delivering supplies to [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] [[GemDiver Station]]. Solo translated the situation to [[Tionne Solusar]]. A rescue mission was mounted and the twins were recovered.\n\n[[File:Lowbacca-YJK5cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lowbacca with his unique bronze lightsaber]]\n\nShortly thereafter, Lowbacca was kidnapped along with his friends Jacen and Jaina, as well as Em Teedee while on a field trip to GemDiver Station. The little droid was taken away from him and they were brought to the [[Shadow Academy]]. There, [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] [[Tamith Kai]] tried to exploit his anger in an attempt to turn him to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. She went to such lengths as reprogramming Em Teedee to spout pro-[[Imperial Remnant|Imperial]] propaganda or subjecting him to arduous [[Torture/Legends|torture]].\n\nLowbacca gave into his anger twice, the first time when Brakiss attacked [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]] with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], and the other when he smashed a screeching [[sonic generator]] beyond all repair. However, Lowbacca was able to keep himself from being indoctrinated. When Jacen freed himself using a [[Corusca gem/Legends|Corusca gem]] that he had acquired during their field trip, Lowbacca used his excellent programming skills to help his friends in an escape attempt aboard the station just in time for Luke and Tenel Ka to show up to rescue them.\n\nLater, Lowbacca went to Kashyyyk with Jacen, Jaina, and Tenel Ka in response to his sister, [[Sirrakuk]]'s, coming of age and going deep in the underlevels of Kashyyyk to harvest strands of the deadly syren plant. Lowbacca had done this under unwise counsel alone, and Sirrakuk wished to repeat this, as did her best friend and Lowbacca's admirer, [[Raabakyysh]]. When Raaba did, though, she disappeared and was presumed dead.\n\nShortly after their arrival, the [[Second Imperium]], headed by [[Zekk]], came to [[Battle of Kashyyyk (Second Imperium Crisis)|raid]] a factory for computer supplies for the new fleet. The two parties soon met, and started a skirmish that killed the Nightsister [[Garowyn]], tumbling into the underlevels of the Kashyyyk forest. There, Lowbacca and the others headed off Vonnda Ra and eleven [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. Shortly following, they encountered a syren plant. There, Nightsister [[Vonnda Ra]] and Sirrakuk were swallowed by the carnivorous plant, with Vonnda Ra being eaten and Sirrakuk pulling out the strands of the plant and then being pulled out by Lowbacca.\n\nIn the [[Third Battle of Yavin]], Tenel Ka and Lowie sabotaged the floating battle platform from which Tamith Kai lead her forces, causing it to crash into a river killing the Nightsister. Suddenly, a bomb exploded and destroyed a large proportion of the Jedi Praxeum though no one was badly injured. With the end of the battle, the Second Imperium had been defeated.\n\n===Diversity Alliance===\nOn one occasion, Lowbacca was tricked into joining the [[Diversity Alliance]]&mdash;an anti-[[Human/Legends|Human]] terrorist organization&mdash;by Raaba, a fellow Wookiee who had been presumed dead on Kashyyyk. However, Lowbacca turned against the Diversity Alliance after learning of their true purposes and rejoined his fellow [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]. He later helped Zekk, [[Bornan Thul]], Tenel Ka, and the [[Solo twins|Solos]] [[Battle of the Emperor's Plague Storehouse|destroy the Emperor's Plague]].\n\n===Black Sun Insurgency===\nDuring the Solo's trip to [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], Lowie, M-TD, Zekk, and Tenel Ka secretly entered the ''[[Rock Dragon]]'' for the [[Blockade Runners Derby]]. They used their combined [[The Force/Legends|Force]] ability and won the Blockade Runners' Derby. The fact that they were training at Luke's Jedi Praxeum caused controversy, but as the ship had not been modified specifically for the derby, as was commonly done by participants, after a few days the matter was dropped.\n\n[[File:AmbushEC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anja Gallandro, Jacen Solo, and Lowbacca are ambushed by chameleon creatures]]\n\nLater in a docking bay some [[chameleon creature]]s, loyal to the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]], were stealing the [[space mine]]s they had found. Lowie, the Solos, Zekk, and Tenel Ka ran out of the ''Rock Dragon'' to stop them. A few of the chameleon creatures were killed. [[Anja Gallandro]] arrived and killed one more escaping chameleon, but they ultimately escaped with the mines.\n\nWhen Han Solo came, Anja accused him of killing [[Gallandro/Legends|her father]]. Han denied this, his children unconvinced either. Anja convinced them to go with her to [[Anobis]], onboard the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] (She really intended to get Han killed in the war). They landed near [[Yuos]]'s village where they were attacked by [[Knaar]]s. After Jacen used a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to scare away the Knaars, Tenel Ka, Jacen, and Lowie went into the woods to meet up with the Falcon. Upon arrival they were arrested by [[Elis]].\n\nAnja then went back to Yons's village with Elis's brother, [[Protas (Human)|Protas]] to blow it up, but one of the mines Protas planted detonated and killed him. After hearing this Elis was more open to negotiations, the end result being Lowie and the Solos' freedom, and an end to [[Anobis]]'s 25 year war.\n\nAnja came back with them to Yavin 4. She shunned everyone but Zekk and Jacen. A few weeks later, Lando invited them to come to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] so they could see the amusement park SkyCenter Galleria that he and [[Cojahn]] were working on. Upon arrival they learned Cojahn was killed (unknown to them by the Black Sun).\n\nLando, despite the bad news, continued with the tour he promised them. Due to lack of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] Anja told [[Czethros]] that Cojahn's death was under investigation. In the swamp simulated environment they found out that the [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes/Legends|Modal Nodes]] mysteriously disappeared so Lando, Zekk, and Jaina went to [[Clak'dor VII]] and learned of Black Sun's influence on Cloud City.\n\n[[File:Lowbacca_Bespin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lowbacca around 24 ABY]]\n\nWhile Lowie was in the snow environment, he noticed an [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]] spying on them, which they followed down a tunnel that led into an open room, where seven Black Sun [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] with images of them showed themselves, and Lowie ran down another hallway. The Ugnaught launched them down a garbage chute, Lowie grabbed an antenna and Tenel Ka with the other hand, however, Jacen wasn't as lucky and fell through the clouds.\n\nThe [[Lady Luck/Legends|''Lady Luck'']] arrived with a rescued Jacen. With the information Jacen heard (from his rescuer [[M'kim]]) and the information Lando got from the Modal Nodes they then had evidence to link [[Cojahn]]'s death to the Black Sun. Lowie looked up the holo recordings, and found a lot of the recordings deleted, but also found [[Czethros]] was on Cloud City and that he himself killed Cojahn.\n\nWhen Lowie, Jacen, and Tenel Ka went to the address for the debriefing about the Black Sun, they were attacked by the [[Bespin Wing Guard/Legends|Bespin Wing Guard]] and Black Sun mercenaries. Lowie jumped into a [[Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud car/Legends|cloud car]] and took off. One mercenary and one wing guard took off in pursuit of Lowie. Just as Lowie's engine was giving out, seven [[Thranta/Legends|thrantas]] and their [[Thranta Rider|Riders]] came and knocked Lowie's pursuers out of their vehicle and caught them. Lowie then came for a landing on Cloud City.\n\nLowie later reunited with his fellow Jedi Knights (all had a similar run-in) and returned to Yavin 4. Later Anja ran out of spice so she stole the ''[[Lightning Rod]]'', and flew it to the spice mines of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. They got a lead from [[Lilmit]] so Tenel Ka, Jacen, and Zekk flew to [[Dac]]. Lowie and Jaina stayed on Kessel.\n\nWhile on Kessel, an army of Black Sun mercenaries [[Battle of Kessel (Black Sun Insurgency)|took control]] of the planet and captured [[Nien Nunb/Legends|Nien Nunb]], though Jaina and Lowbacca managed to escape. They found out that while Kessel, Czethros planed to send a signal that would trigger Black Sun spies everywhere. However, Jaina, Lowie, and M-TD sabotaged his plan by destroying the transmitter before Czethros could send the signal. Lowie also helped free the prisoners and defeated the Black Sun mercenaries. Czethros fell into a vat of [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and was flash-frozen instantly. The criminal was retrieved by the New Republic. As a result, the names of Black Sun spies in strategic positions of power were discovered amounting to the defeat of the Black Sun.\n\nFollowing this ordeal, the Solo Twins, Anakin, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, and Zekk were promoted to apprentice Jedi Knights during a ceremony at the Jedi Praxeum.\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War===\n{{Quotetrans|You don't suppose that New Republic Intelligence has once again drop-kicked their brains and sent us out here for nothing?|Lowbacca to Jaina Solo (translated from Shyriiwook)|The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way}}\n\nWhen Chewbacca died at the start of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Lowbacca attended his funeral on Kashyyyk. Later, he and Chewbacca's son [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawaroo]] vowed to take up his life debt to [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] after Chewbacca's [[Funeral of Chewbacca|funeral]], but Han insisted that he was still mourning Chewbacca. Instead, Luke assigned him to accompany Jedi Knight [[Daye Azur-Jamin]] and his wife [[Tinian I'att Azur-Jamin|Tinian I'att]], a [[Chenlambec|Wookiee]]-trained [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], as scouts in [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]].\n\n[[File:Lowie-myrkr.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Lowbacca during the mission to Myrkr]]\n\nWhen Daye was captured on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], and the Yuuzhan Vong tightened their grip on Hutt territory, however, Lowie and Tinian had to flee back into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] territory, returning to his home planet of Kashyyyk.\n\nEarly in the War he returned to Yavin 4, and trained with [[Finn Galfridian]]. He then went with Finn and the Solo's to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] to retrieve a [[Dray's holocron|holocron]].\n\nUnable to fulfill the debt to Han himself, Lowbacca subsequently stuck close to the Solo children, particularly Jaina. He took part in the [[Myrkr strike team]]'s [[Mission to Myrkr|assault]] on the [[voxyn]] [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]] facility onboard the [[Koros-Strohna|worldship]] ''[[Baanu Rass]]'', and subsequently served as Jaina's first mate aboard ''[[Trickster]]''. He later became a member of [[Twin Suns Squadron]] under Jaina's command, where he earned the nickname Streak. At the [[Battle of Ebaq]], Lowbacca was stabbed by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]], but the wound was not fatal. By the end of the war, Lowbacca was commanding a squadron of his own, and he later bonded with a [[Zonama Sekotan fighter|seedship]] on [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] which he flew during the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar]]. After the war, Lowbacca told Han he and Waroo were assuming Chewbacca's life debt.\n\n===Dark Nest Crisis===\n[[File:Lowbacca.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Lowbacca during his days in the New Jedi Order]]\nIn the years after the war, the Jedi went to great lengths to help the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] recover. Lowbacca worked with Jaina and [[Tesar Sebatyne]] on at least one occasion in helping to foil criminal warlords eager to profit from the war's fallout. In [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], after the three boarded the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Night Lady]]'' and took down the [[Yaka]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Redstar]], they attended his trial on the maximum security [[Space station/Legends|space station]] [[MaxSec Eight]]. While Jaina was testifying, the received a Force-cry from their old friend [[Raynar Thul]]. Along with most of the other survivors of the Myrkr mission, Lowbacca followed it into the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] and discovered that Thul was now Unuthul, the leader of a colony of [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]].<ref name=\"The Joiner King\">''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''</ref>\n\nLowbacca was one of several Jedi who became [[Joiner]]s and were absorbed into the Killik [[Hive mind/Legends|hive mind]]. He fought for the [[Insectoid/Legends|insectoid]] [[Species/Legends|species]] during their conflict with the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]], and was captured by Chiss forces. He was released by [[Jagged Fel]] after the signing of the [[Qoribu Truce]],<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> but the move ended up forcing Fel's entire [[Fel dynasty|family]] into [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] from the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]].<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref> After the truce, Lowie and Tesar [[Hunting/Legends|hunted]] pirates who were hijacking abaarian [[Water/Legends|water]] shipments.<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\">''[[Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[36 ABY]], the Killik-Chiss conflict was reignited by the machinations of Jacen Solo and erupted into an all-out [[Swarm War]]. During the war, Lowbacca, Tesar, and [[Tahiri Veila]] had endangered the security of the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] by telling [[Aryn Dro Thul]], Raynar Thul's [[Parent/Legends|mother]], that the Jedi were planning to kill her son. Grand Master Luke Skywalker found out and ordered the three to [[Meditation/Legends|meditate]] on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"The Swarm War\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref>\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War===\n[[File:Lowiebyshea.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Lowbacca]]\nIn [[40 ABY]], tensions rose between the Galactic Alliance and the [[Five Worlds]] government of the [[Corellian system]]. While Corellia was under [[Blockade of Corellia|blockade]], Lowbacca and Tesar operated under the command of Alliance [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Nek Bwua'tu]]. Bwua'tu had Jaina and Zekk monitoring secret [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] in the [[Kiris Asteroid Cluster]], but when the two were relieved of their posts and sent to the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]], Lowbacca and Tesar took over.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nThe Jedi departed the Alliance after it fell under the despotic rule of Jacen Solo, now the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Darth Caedus. Lowbacca was one of many Jedi who fought against Caedus during the [[Battle of Kashyyyk (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Kashyyyk]], and led a Jedi charge against Caedus's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']]. Caedus attempted to [[Force meld]] with Lowbacca in order to sense where the other Jedi Knights were. Lowbacca tried to mentally reason with Caedus while simultaneously launching a [[Jedi shadow bomb|shadow bomb]] at the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]]; the bomb hit, but a distraction caused by [[Ben Skywalker]] saved Caedus' life.<ref name=\"Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\nLowbacca's home planet joined a [[Jedi Coalition]] directed against Caedus in the battle's aftermath.<ref name=\"Inferno\" /> In [[41 ABY]], Lowbacca went on to participate in some of the final battles of the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], which ended after Caedus was [[Battle of Uroro Station|slain]] in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]] by his own twin sister, Jaina.<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref>\n\n===Rising Tensions===\nIn [[44 ABY]], Jaina and Lando Calrissian returned to the Jedi's home base on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] after an encounter with the recently-discovered [[Lost Tribe of Sith]]. Lowbacca was presented with a modified [[MSE-series]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] that had been placed aboard Calrissian's ''[[Rockhound]]'' by [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] pirates in an effort to determine the [[Programmer/Legends|programming]] style and hopefully learn the location of the Sith base.<ref name=\"Vortex\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]''</ref>\n\nThe Jedi Order prepared to launch its [[StealthX]] wing from Coruscant to assist Luke Skywalker in his battle with the Lost Tribe. Lowbacca was one of several veteran Jedi pilots who helped command the fighter wing. After launching, the wing arrived at [[Pydyr]] and did [[Battle in the Fallanassi village|battle]] with Sith forces,<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> who soon after escaped.<ref name=\"Conviction\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Visuallowie.jpg|thumb|right|135px|Lowbacca]]\n{{Quote|Seriously? A Wookiee, with a lightsaber! That's just overkill.|[[Spraug]] after being confronted by Lowbacca.|Invasion 5}}\nLowbacca was a serious fighter who loved the heat of battle. He had a slight sense of humor, but only used it when it was necessary. Of their core group of friends, Lowbacca enjoyed spending time with [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] because of Jacen's sense of humor. Their relationship came to an end after Jacen became Darth Caedus and ravaged Kashyyyk, Lowbacca's homeworld, thus forcing the Wookiee Jedi to fight his former friend until Caedus' eventual demise.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLowbacca was created by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and [[Rebecca Moesta]], and featured as a major protagonist throughout their fourteen-book [[Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights|''Young Jedi Knights'']] series of young adult novels, published from [[1995]] to [[1998]]. He later went on to feature in several installments of [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|''The New Jedi Order'']] series of novels, which were released from [[1999]] to [[2003]]. A baby Lowbacca appears in the 1998 novel ''[[Rebel Dawn]]''.\n\nAfter the release of ''[[Star Wars: The Dark Nest Trilogy]]'', [[George Lucas]] declared that no more Wookiee Jedi could be made in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]].<ref>{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/79/indexp2.html|text=Wookiees: No Trivia Too Small}}</ref> Lowbacca was exiled to Dagobah in [[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War|''The Swarm War'']], the final chapter of trilogy, but author [[Troy Denning]] stated that it was not permanent.<ref>[http://www.njoe.com/index.php?id=view&sub=ex&sub2=inter&sub3=552 Troy Denning on NJOE.com]</ref> When asked about Lowbacca's sudden disappearance, [[Sue Rostoni]], Executive Editor of [[Lucas Licensing]], replied that he was busy doing 'Jedi things.'<ref>[[Sue Rostoni]] ([[October 5]], [[2006]]).
