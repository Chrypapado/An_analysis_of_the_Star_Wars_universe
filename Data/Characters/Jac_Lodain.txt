He was the leader of a group of thirteen-[[Standard year|year]]-old farmhands, including the [[human]] [[Shari]], a [[Unidentified Sullustan farmer|Sullustan]], and a [[Unidentified Gungan farmer|Gungan]]. The group was surprised by the [[smuggler]] [[Izal Garsea]]'s appearance when their former colleague [[Julen Rakab]] brought her to the [[farm]]. Garsea told them that she was in between jobs, and the group was impressed that she owned her own [[starship]], the [[light freighter]] [[Meridian (light freighter)|''Meridian'']]. When Shari and the [[Gungan]] entreated Garsea to stay at the farm, Lodain rebuffed Shari's suggestion smugly, pointing out that her grandparents needed somewhere to hide after the [[Clone Wars]].
