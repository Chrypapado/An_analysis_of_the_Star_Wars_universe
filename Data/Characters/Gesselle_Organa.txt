However, a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]] of [[Darth Baras]] managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup mode&mdash;cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\n\nAfter the [[Sith Warrior]] sabotaged the planetary generator and killed numerous [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], Organa, along with [[Blenks]], [[Kan'grell]], and [[Prinn]] confronted the Sith, who was looking for information about Jaesa Willsaam, Organa's former handmaiden. Organa decided to make an offer to the Sith, which was refused. The Sith started to torture Blenks, who was Organa's lover. Refusing to watch him [[Death/Legends|die]], Organa revealed that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Jaesa Willsaam]]'s [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were still servants at [[Castle Organa]]. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Warrior executed Organa and her bodyguards for defying the Empire.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organa, Gesselle}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House of Organa]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Republic Army generals]]"}}}]}}}}
