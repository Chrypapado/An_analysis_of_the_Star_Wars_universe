The pair attempted this by having a [[Gender/Legends|female]] college infiltrate the museum and reprogram one of the [[ASP-7 labor droid]]s that worked there to bring the pots to the museum's loading dock and walk off the edge with them into a waiting speeder, driven by Urnon. Hewpaj's job was to distract the museum staff with his [[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]] from a nearby building until Urnon picked him up after collecting the stolen pots. However during their escape the pair were chased by a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] which caused them to crash their stolen [[hot rod]] [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] into the [[Royal Icqui Aquaria]]. Both ended up in the tank of a [[Pierceskimmer]] where they were knocked unconscious and possibly devoured by the beast.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHewpaj was a character in the [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook|saga edition]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]] mini-adventure [[Art For Art's Sake]] and so the above biography assumes the adventure is completed as suggested in the article.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030220art|text=Art For Art's Sake|int=Art For Art's Sake|archivedate=20090828012419}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
