While the ships were gathered in the remains of Alderaan within the [[Alderaan system]], the ''Sunspire's'' [[sensor]]s picked up several large ships approaching. Worried, Beagle reported via [[hologram]] to the Alderaanians' [[Regent Administrator]] [[Eglyn Valmor]], but then quickly announced that the ships had [[New Republic]] code clearance. The new ships turned out to be bringing the wreckage of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] to the flotilla as a gift from the New Republic, which some then suggested should be used to build a [[space station]] for the Alderaanians to live on.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRickert Beagle first appeared in the novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]] and released in [[2016]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}} {{Hologram}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Rickert Beagle\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beagle, Rickert}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Communications officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
