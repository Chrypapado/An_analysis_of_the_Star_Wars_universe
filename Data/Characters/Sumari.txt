We&hellip; we suffer&hellip;|Matriarch Sumari|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Sumari''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] and the [[Matriarch]] of [[Kalikori village]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]]. Succeeding [[Kolovish]] as leader of the [[Pilgrims]], Sumari brought her daughter, [[Ranna Tao'Ven]], with her to Tython, where the Pilgrims built their small settlement in the [[Tythos Ridge]] mountains near the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order's]] [[Jedi Temple (Tython)/Legends|new Temple]]. Sumari served as Matriarch for several [[Standard year/Legends|years]] until she fell ill around [[3643 BBY]], when the native [[Flesh Raider]]s began to [[Flesh Raider uprising|attack]] both the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the villagers in greater numbers. Despite her sickness, Sumari directed her villagers while aiding the Order in investigating the causes of the natives' recent activities. Ultimately, however, the Twi'lek succumbed to her illness and [[Death/Legends|died]], leaving her daughter as the new Matriarch.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I shut down the energy shield. Any word on Master Orgus' mission?''\"<br />\"''No. My mother&hellip;she found peace during your absence. I'm now Matriarch.|The Padawan and Ranna Tao'Ven|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Sumari joined the [[Pilgrims]], a religious group founded by [[Matriarch]] [[Kolovish]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], during the Pilgrims's travels between Twi'lek colonies during the [[Great Galactic War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]].<ref name=\"Pilgrims\">{{TORcite|type=codex|Twi'lek Pilgrims}}</ref> Sumari and her daughter [[Ranna Tao'Ven]] were among the Pilgrims who settled on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] and refused to depart after the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] denial of their settlement request, establishing [[Kalikori village]] at the base of the [[Matriarch's Summit]] in the [[Tythos Ridge]]. Sumari eventually became the Matriarch of the village when Kolovish retired to an [[Kolovish's tower|ancient stone tower]] atop the summit.<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" />\n\n[[File:Sumari_illness.png|thumb|left|170px|Sumari's illness sapped her strength and left her exhausted.]]\nAround [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"Time\" /> the native [[Flesh Raider]] began to attack the village in greater numbers and with rising frequency. Also around this [[Time/Legends|time]], Sumari fell ill, and was plagued by weakness and feelings of fatigue and exhaustion. Whenever her [[Parent/Legends|mother's]] illness was too much for her, Sumari's daughter, Tao'Ven, would take over her duties as Matriarch,<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" /> as she did during the [[Search for the Fount of Rajivari|crisis]] involving [[Nalen Raloch]] and the [[Fount of Rajivari]]. Raloch, a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] villager, discovered the mystical Fount and was corrupted to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and driven insane.<ref name=\"Pilgrims2\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|Pilgrims|Tython}}</ref> He then attempted to destroy the [[Forge]]<ref name=\"The Forge\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|The Forge|Tython}}</ref> machine that the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] used to construct [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]],<ref name=\"Forge Codex\">{{TORcite|type=codex|The Forge}}</ref> but was stopped by the [[The Barsen'thor|apprentice]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Yuon Par]] and healed of his insanity. Raloch was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] as a way of easing tensions between the Order and the village,<ref name=\"The Forge\" /> but the people of Kalikori Village remained resentful of the Jedi for their lack of aid.<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" />\n\nWhen a group of Flesh Raiders under the leadership of a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] named [[Callef]] attacked the region known as the [[Tythonian Gnarls]], a [[Hero of Tython|Jedi apprentice]] [[Duel in the Gnarls cave|fought and defeated]] Callef. Having witnessed the apprentice's skill,<ref name=\"Attack of the Flesh Raiders\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Attack of the Flesh Raiders|Tython}}</ref> Jedi Master [[Orgus Din]] took the young Jedi on as his own [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], and sent the apprentice to Kalikori to see if the villagers had noticed anything strange lately.<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" />\n\nThe apprentice met with Sumari and her daughter, and the Matriarch expressed her anger with the Jedi about their refusal to aid the village before directing the young apprentice to speak with her [[Scout Chief]], [[Moorint]]. Sumari would have continued the conversation, but her illness had taxed her strength too much, and she was forced to retire. Sumari rested while the Padawan [[Raid on the Flesh Raider weapons cache|recovered]] a supply of weapons from the Flesh Raiders for the villagers,<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" /> but by the time the Padawan returned to the village after [[Skirmish at the ancient shrine|several]] [[Raid on the Tythos Ridge shield generator|missions]], Sumari had passed away, leaving Tao'Ven as the new Matriarch.<ref name=\"The Face of the Enemy\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|So the Jedi finally deign to recognize my people's suffering? How noble.|Sumari|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA green-skinned Twi'lek female with [[Color/Legends|blue]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], Sumari cared deeply for her people. Even when she fell deathly ill, she continued to serve as Matriarch until her illness had weakened her to the point where she could no longer walk. Sumari held a deep grudge against the Jedi Order for refusing aid to her village, but swallowed her pride when Orgus Din's apprentice approached the village with an offer of help.<ref name=\"High-Tech Savages\" /> Her devotion to her people overrode her personal feelings and safety, and her passing greatly affected her daughter, Ranna Tao'Ven.<ref name=\"The Face of the Enemy\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSumari was created for ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] released by [[BioWare]] on [[December 20]], [[2011]].
