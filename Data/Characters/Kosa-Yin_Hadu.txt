A group of Believers led by Hadu and Granga established a [[Believers camp|temporary camp]] on an Almas hilltop and erected a [[Tent/Legends|tent]] to serve as Hadu's field office and personal quarters. Using the camp as a base, the Believers attacked kaluthin [[Farm/Legends|farms]] across Almas over a period of three [[Standard month/Legends|months]], [[Poison/Legends|poisoning]] many of the planet's [[aquifer]]s with a biological toxin and causing large swaths of kaluthin to die. Agitated by the attacks on their crops, some of Almas's kaluthin farmers blamed the Jedi Order for the death of their plants. In an attempt to further escalate tensions between the farmers and the Jedi, Hadu visited the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Building 49-A]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Forard]] and bad-mouthed the Jedi while in the presence of a number of farmers.<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\nThe [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] at a [[Forard research station|kaluthin research station]] on Almas started to investigate the areas of kaluthin extinction, and Hadu and Grangra feared that the station posed a risk to the Believers' operation, believing that the researchers might be able to identify the toxins that the Believers were using to poison the aquifers. In an attempt to mitigate the threat posed by the scientists, Hadu, Granga, and several other Believers traveled to the planet [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], where they plotted to stop a shipment of supplies from being transported to the research station, to prevent the scientists from performing their studies. The supplies were due to be taken to Almas by the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Welrin Maduk]] aboard the [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] ''[[Fool's Paradise]]'', so the two Dark Jedi headed to the ''Fool's Paradise''{{'s}} [[Hangar/Legends|landing bay]] in the city of [[Hedrett]] with some other Believers, planning to hijack the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]]. As a safeguard, Hadu and Granga parked a starship on a landing pad near the ''Fool's Paradise'' and then concealed their craft and an exit from the ''Fool's Paradise''{{'s}} landing bay using a [[Mind trick/Legends|Force illusion]]. The Dark Jedi duo then approached the ''Fool's Paradise'' while accompanied by a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] and three other Believers, and the pair told Welrin Maduk that they had been sent by the port authority. Maduk protested and claimed that his ship had already been inspected, so Hadu and Granga ignited their lightsabers and prepared to attack the Duros. However, the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin [[Star system/Legends|system]], saw that Maduk was being threatened, and they came to his rescue. As the agents approached the ''Fool's Paradise'', Hadu and Granga fled through the concealed hangar entrance, leaving the battle [[Droid/Legends|droids]] and the other Believers to face the agents alone.<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\nHadu returned to the Believers' hilltop camp on Almas, where he received a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] message from Garvin Delquist, who warned him and Granga that the Jedi had learned of the Believers' presence on Almas and urged the two Dark Jedi to accelerate the [[Time/Legends|timetable]] of their work to poison the kaluthin. The Heroes of Cularin investigated the poisoning of the aquifers, and they launched an assault on the Believers' encampment. After being alerted of the attack, Hadu emerged from his tent and engaged the agents in combat along with some of his guards, while the other Believers powered up their [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeders]] in preparation to evacuate the camp. The agents eventually defeated Hadu and his Believer subordinates, thwarting the Gungan's attempts to wipe out the kaluthin. The Jedi learned Hadu's identity, and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Seenlu Kir]] began to research the mission on which Hadu and Kin-Ya Dosun had disappeared, in an attempt to discover how the two Gungans had been lost. However, her research was unsuccessful, for she did not learn anything new about the two Gungans.<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKosa-Yin Hadu was an angry individual who was happy to persecute and [[Torture/Legends|torture]] other people in order to achieve his aims. He wore an [[All-Temperature Cloak]] and was equipped with both a lightsaber and a [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistol]]. Although he originally studied as a Jedi Padawan, he later turned his allegiance to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] cult of the Believers.<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHadu mastered a number of [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]], and he was able to use [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Force sense/Legends|sense things]], [[Telekinesis/Legends|grip objects]], [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] himself, [[Battlemind|augment his fighting spirit]], and boost his combat abilities. In addition, he was able to use the powers of [[Hatred|Force hatred]] and [[Force rage]] when fighting against his opponents. Hadu was [[Language/Legends|multi-lingual]] and could speak [[Gungan Basic|Gungan]] and [[Mon Calamarian]] in addition to [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]].<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKosa-Yin Hadu was created by [[Adam Burns]] for ''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'', a [[2002]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|role-playing]] supplement that formed part of the [[Almas, Sweet Almas trilogy]] of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign. In the supplement, the player characters [[Roleplaying game|role-play]] as the Heroes of Cularin, and when the agents confront Hadu at the Believers' encampment on Almas, the Gungan's level of combat prowess is dependent on the players' role-playing experience tier. If the players are in the lower role-playing tier, Hadu is weakened as a result of expending large amounts of Force energy to terrorize some farmers earlier in the day, and during combat, he does not use the Force to heal himself, because he does not believe that the agents are worth the effort. If the players are in the medium tier, Hadu has used up some of his Force energy to intimidate some innocent beings prior to the agents' assault, and during the attack, he considers using the Force to heal himself if the players pose a danger to him. If the player characters are in the higher role-playing tier, Hadu is at full strength when he engages the agents in combat. When the players' battle against Hadu comes to a conclusion, the Gungan can either be killed or escape. If the agents kill him, it is possible for one of the player characters to loot Hadu's lightsaber.<ref name=\"TKAAG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hadu, Kosa-Yin}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitive Believers]]\n[[Category:Gungans of unspecified race]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
