Believing that Durd would promise to offer aid and supplies for the wounded, Brandeh and the villagers agreed to his statement. After some time, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], posing as [[Farmer/Legends|farmers]], arrived to warn the inhabitants about the Separatist's plot until one of the shields of the village threatened to fail, causing the refinery to collapse. When the residents were suffering, Brandeh and [[Greti]] assisted Obi-Wan and Skywalker in healing several of the villagers from the illness. As Durd learned that the two Jedi were hiding in Torbel, he sent an army of [[Battle droid/Legends|Battle droids]] to eliminate them. As the Separatists attacked the village, Brandeh was killed by a swarm of [[Mosquito droid]]s during the [[Battle of Lanteeb|fight]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege]]'' {{1st|[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Brandeh\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lanteebans]]"}}}]}}}}
