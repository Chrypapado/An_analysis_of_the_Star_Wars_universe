He worked many years and was promoted to an important position in the local office on [[Kwenn Space Station/Legends|Kwenn Space Station]]. However, years of shady dealings led him to leave IOCI to avoid being investigated and prosecuted. He became a free-lance expediter where his connections allowed him to stay in business.\n\nHe was not particularly interesting, but had an intense personality and tendency to chatter non-stop which would often cause people to be drawn to him. He was utterly selfish and cared only for [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. He believed information was valuable, and he was a master at trading it.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=No Disintegrations (West End Games)|text=''No Disintegrations''|story=Seregar Turnabout}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snivas, Jerik}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations officers]]\n[[Category:Lianns]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
