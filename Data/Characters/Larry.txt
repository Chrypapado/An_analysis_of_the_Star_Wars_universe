In his [[Youngling/Legends|childhood]], Larry ran away from his [[Larry's tribe|home]] and became a [[Hermit/Legends|hermit]], living alone inside of a [[Tree/Legends|tree]]. When visitors came to the [[Endor tree fort|fort]] built atop his [[Plant/Legends|tree]], Larry frightened them off by shrieking into the tree's roots, which reverberated his voice throughout the structure. The [[Kagles]], who had visited the fort and believed Larry's voice to be evil [[Forest/Legends|forest]] [[Ghost (folklore)/Legends|spirits]], referred to him as \"'''the Shrieks'''.\"\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]] and [[Teebo/Legends|Teebo]] came to reside in the tree fort and eventually discovered Larry. The hermit told the Ewoks his story, and the pair, having also ran from home, decided that they should return. That [[Standard day/Legends|night]], Larry and the Ewoks went to [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]] and celebrated the [[Harvest Festival (Endor)|Harvest Festival]]. Later, when Warrick and Teebo were trading items on behalf of the [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]] [[Mooth]], Larry convinced the Ewoks to give him a [[fire feather blanket]] for free.\n\n==Biography==\n===Hermit life===\n====Leaving home====\n{{Quote|Intruders.

When [[Gender/Legends|he]] was a [[Youngling/Legends|child]], he ran away from his [[Larry's tribe|home]], saying that it would take \"a million [[Munyip/Legends|munyips]] to drag him back.\" He came to live inside a [[Tree/Legends|tree]] near the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[City/Legends|settlement]] of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]]. After a few [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of independence, Larry grew homesick and returned to his childhood abode, only to discover that everyone there had moved away.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" /> By [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=\"EwoksDate\">{{EwoksDate|appearance of Larry|[[Home is Where the Shrieks Are]]\" and \"[[Hard Sell]]}}</ref> Larry's [[Plant/Legends|tree]] had a [[Endor tree fort|fort]] built into its branches. Larry was unreceptive to visitors, and he scared off intruders by shrieking into the tree's roots; the roots echoed the sound throughout the fort and created an illusion of multiple displaced voices. One group of visitors, the [[Kagles]], believed Larry's cries to be evil [[Forest/Legends|forest]] [[Ghost (folklore)/Legends|spirits]] and dubbed the mysterious howling \"the Shrieks.\"<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" />\n\nIn 3 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]],<ref name=\"EwoksDate\" /> Larry's tree received two uninvited guests: the young Ewoks [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]] and [[Teebo/Legends|Teebo]]. The pair had run away from Bright Tree Village and decided to occupy the old, ramshackle tree fort. When the Ewoks climbed into the fort, Larry spied on them, laughing and telling himself that they would not stay long. Later that [[Standard day/Legends|day]], as Warrick and Teebo made repairs to the fort, Larry peered at them from beneath the floorboards.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" />\n\n====Meeting the Ewoks====\n{{Quote|I've been here all alone ever since I ran away from home as a kid. After a few years, I got homesick, but when I went back, everyone had moved.''\"<br />\"''You mean they left you?''\"<br />\"''Yeah. I told them it would take a million munyips to drag me back home. So they left without me.|Larry and Teebo|audio=LarryAllAlone-Ewoks.ogg|Home is Where the Shrieks Are}}\nLater, during a [[Water/Legends|rainstorm]], Warrick was alone in the fort. Larry watched him from inside the wall and shrieked loudly, startling the Ewok. Teebo reentered the fort with the Kagles and started a game of [[Trok (game)|Trok]]. The Kagles were surprised that the Shrieks allowed the Ewoks to stay. When Warrick revealed that he had not heard of the Shrieks, the Kagles realized that they were in the fort without permission and fled, terrified. Warrick and Teebo considered returning to their village but instead began setting traps to defeat the Shrieks.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" />\n\n[[File:LarryConfesses-HIWTSA.png|thumb|left|250px|Larry confesses to Wicket Wystri Warrick and Teebo.]]\nOnce the Ewoks set up their traps and darkened the room, Larry crept through the space, causing the Ewoks to tumble into their own traps. Larry fled through the fort's front door, shrieking, with the Ewoks in pursuit. Larry then ran back into the tree, and the Ewoks followed his voice inside. As the Ewoks approached, he continued to shriek and laugh, warning them to turn back or be destroyed. Teebo wanted to leave, but Warrick took Teebo's [[magic pouch]] and blew dust into the tree roots, causing Larry to sneeze. He then ran out of the tree roots for fresh [[Atmosphere/Legends|air]], and the Ewoks tackled him.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" />\n\nWith Larry held down, Warrick told the Shrieks to surrender. Larry confessed that there was nobody else, and that the Shrieks were just him. Warrick did not believe him, so Larry pulled back a curtain and revealed the tree's \"voice roots.\" Teebo asked why Larry had to scare them, to which he simply replied that they had been in his tree. He told the Ewoks his story of running away from home. Upon hearing Larry's tale, the Ewoks decided to return to Bright Tree Village. That night, Larry attended the village's [[Harvest Festival (Endor)|Harvest Festival]], happily chattering and [[Diet/Legends|gorging]] himself with various [[Foodstuff/Legends|foods]].<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" />\n\n===Striking a bargain===\n{{Dialogue|Larry|Oh, that's real nice.

When Larry said that it was [[Temperature/Legends|cold]] outside, Warrick offered to trade the [[Hermit/Legends|hermit]] a [[fire feather blanket]]. Larry noted that the [[Blanket/Legends|blanket]] was nice but that he had nothing to trade for it.<ref name=\"Hard Sell\">{{Ewoks|Hard Sell}}</ref>\n\nHe shivered and wiped away tears as he reiterated that he was poor, lonely, and cold. Larry's desperation made Teebo cry, and the hermit continued his act until Warrick gave him the blanket for free. He then thanked Warrick and bounded inside the tree.<ref name=\"Hard Sell\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|But why did you scare us?''\"<br />\"''Because you were in my tree.|Teebo and Larry|audio=LarryMyTree-Ewoks.ogg|Home is Where the Shrieks Are}}\nLarry was an obese,<ref name=\"Insider 27\">{{InsiderCite|27|A Star Wars CELibration|A ''Star Wars'' CELibration}}</ref> [[Color/Legends|violet]]-[[Hair/Legends|furred]] alien male with an orange [[Nose/Legends|nose]] and bags under his three yellow-green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].

Larry had a gray moustache and black eyebrows.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" /> He was approximately 0.8 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall.<ref name=\"Height note\" />\n\nAs a child, Larry left his home. After returning to his childhood home and discovering that everyone there had moved, he felt as if he had been left behind. During Larry's [[Time/Legends|time]] as a lonely, reclusive hermit, he talked to himself and scared away visitors by yelling and laughing. At the Harvest Festival, Larry consumed generous amounts of food and drink, talking to his new Ewok acquaintances.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" /> On a later occasion, Larry used his reputation as a lone hermit to receive a [[Fire/Legends|fire]] feather blanket from Warrick.<ref name=\"Hard Sell\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|You can't fool us.

By yelling into the roots, his voice was carried throughout the entire tree and sounded like an [[Army/Legends|army]] of spirits. Inside the tree, Larry had a torch, curtains covering a tunnel to the roots, and a pot filled with food.<ref name=\"Home is Where the Shrieks Are\" /> When Larry received a fire feather blanket from Warrick, he took the gift into his tree.<ref name=\"Hard Sell\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Larry-KeyArt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Final model sheet of Larry]]\nLarry first appeared in \"[[Home is Where the Shrieks Are]],\" the third episode in the [[Ewoks: Season Two|second season]] of the animated television series [[Ewoks (TV series)|''Ewoks'']].
