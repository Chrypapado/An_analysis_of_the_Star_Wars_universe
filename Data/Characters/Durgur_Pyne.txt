I'm in charge of security. We've had some problems with pirates recently. I hate pirates. There's nothing I like better than blasting them into so much space dust. Word around town is that you're pretty good with that sort of thing. I'm a bit short-handed right now. Think you can help me bring these lousy murderers in?|Durgur Pyne|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n[[Captain/Legends|Captain]] '''Durgur Pyne''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Police officer/Legends|member]] of the [[Corellian Security Force]].

Since he did not have enough men available, he employed the aid of a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] willing to help. Pyne first tasked the spacer with rescuing one of his best agents, who was kidnapped by the sleemos. The spacer succeeded in the rescue, allowing the agent to provide Pyne with the location of the pirate leader, a notorious and dangerous criminal.\n\nThe spacer helped him track down and arrest a murderous pirate lieutenant, freed a kidnapped CorSec agent from the hands of Sleemo thugs and eliminated the leader of a pirate organization for which Pyne paid him a fair amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDurgur Pyne was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pyne, Durgur}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
