He spent [[time]] at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] in the [[spaceport]] of [[Mos Eisley]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] before accompanying Jabba to find the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] in [[Docking Bay 94]]. Byrnloo and several other thugs began searching around Solo's [[YT-1300 light freighter|ship]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', but the smuggler arrived and offered to pay back the [[Credit|money]] he owed the Hutt. After haggling with Solo over interest on the debt, Jabba called off Byrnloo and the others, and they left the docking bay.\n\n==Biography==\n===Visiting the cantina===\n[[File:Ront_Byrnloo_at_the_cantina.png|thumb|left|250px|Ront Byrnloo was one of the patrons at Chalmun's Cantina in 0 BBY.]]\nA [[Corellian|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Corellia]],<ref name=\"Homeworld\" /> the [[human]] [[Gender|male]]<ref name=\"ANH\" /> Ront Byrnloo<ref name=\"Tweet\">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/853330463041232897|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=Two newly named cantina denizens courtesy of the panel @TomSpinaDesigns and I just wrapped. #SWCO|image=File:RontByrnlooTwitter.png}}</ref> was a [[pirate]]<ref name=\"Cantina BTS\" /> and [[bounty hunter]]<ref name=\"YOMAR\">{{Shortstory|story=You Owe Me a Ride|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> who served<ref name=\"ANH\" /> the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]<ref name=\"ANH\" /><ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\" /> as an enforcer.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], which includes Ront Byrnloo's [[time]] in [[Mos Eisley]], to [[0 BBY]].</ref> Byrnloo and two other human thugs were drinking at the [[Cantina|bar]]<ref name=\"Cantina BTS\" /> of [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]]<ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\" /> in the [[spaceport]] of [[Mos Eisley]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] when local [[moisture farmer]] [[Luke Skywalker]] and the hermit [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] entered with the [[droid]]s [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]].<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\nByrnloo and the two others then left the cantina and joined Jabba, three<ref name=\"ANH\" /> [[Rodian]]s, and the [[bounty]] [[Hunting|hunter]] [[Boba Fett]]<ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\" /> in traveling to [[Docking Bay 94]] in Mos Eisley,<ref name=\"ANH\" /> where the [[YT-1300 light freighter]]<ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\" /> known as the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' was docked.
