Lha-Mi's skill with a [[Force-imbued sword|sword]] were legendary when he was appointed as a [[Je'daii Temple Master]], the highest ranking members of the Order. Lha-Mi governed the Great Temple of Martial Arts, [[Stav Kesh]]. Assisted in his duties by [[Je'daii Master]] [[Tave]], Lha-Mi and the other Temple Masters formed the [[Je'daii Council|Masters' Council]], meeting via [[Holocomm/Legends|holocommunication]] at the Temple of Balance, [[Akar Kesh]].<ref name=\"DotJ4\" /> \n\nWhen [[Je'daii Journeyer]]s [[Dalien Brock|Dalien]] and [[Lanoree Brock]] were studying at Stav Kesh during their [[Great Journey]] circa [[25,802 BBY]], the siblings were called before the Temple Master after they were both injured during a training session with Master [[Kin'ade]] and her [[Darrow Sphere]]. Dalien's impatience with his limited Force ability led to both his own injury and his sisters, forcing Kin'ade to intervene. Listening to their account of the situation, Lha-Mi dismisses Kin'ade and the younger Brock, while asking Lanoree to stay behind for further discussion on her future and how Dalien's path was his own to tread. At the end of the Brock siblings' time at Stav Kesh, Lha-Mi oversaw a controlled fight in the Great Hall alongside Masters Kin'ade and Tave. The Brocks, two [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] twins, a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], and a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] demonstrate their skills to the Masters one last time, with Tave and Kin'ade softening their blows through the Force to avoid injuries. When the fighting concludes, Lha-Mi summons Lanoree Brock to his spartan chambers for one final meetings before she departs in the morning. The Temple Master shows Brock a hexagonal chamber adorned only with framed pictures on the walls, dozens of beings from across the system that Lha-Mi has failed. He explains to her that he keeps this room open for all to visit as a symbol that no one among the Je'daii is perfect, not even a Temple Master.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\nDuring the [[Stargazer Uprising]], Lha-Mi arranged a meeting with [[Je'daii Ranger]] Lanoree Brock aboard his [[Peacemaker-class cruiser|''Peacemaker''-class cruiser]] in a remote field thirty [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] south of [[Akar Kesh]]. Attended by Masters [[Dam-Powl]], [[Tem Madog]], [[Xiang]], a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], and one other, Lha-Mi had arranged the secretive meeting to discuss the growing problem of Dalien Brock's [[Stargazers (sect)|Stargazer cult]]. Chosen because of her involvement in the [[Hang Layden]] accords on [[Kalimahr]], a successful mission to [[Nox]], and her elimination of the leader of  Wookiee dissidents on [[Ska Gora]], [[Gharcanna]]; but also because of the fact that Dalien and Lanoree were siblings, Ranger Brock was given a briefing on the threat he posed to the Order. Brock and his cult desired to leave the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] and planned to do so by activating a [[hypergate]] rumored to be located deep within the heart of the [[Old City (Tython)|Old City]] far out in the [[Red Desert]] on the continent of [[Talss]]. While Lha-Mi vehemently denied the existence of the hypergate, going as far as to seal the cabin of his starship using the Force when mention of it arose, he insisted that the true threat to Tython was the method in which Brock planned to open the gate. A [[Gree device|device]] using the ancient [[Gree technology|technology]] of the [[Gree/Legends|Gree]] to create [[Dark matter/Legends|dark matter]] was theorized by the Je'daii to rip open a [[Black hole/Legends|black hole]] if activated on Tython, and potentially destroy the entire system. Hoping to avoid panic by sending a larger group to find and detain Brock or worse, lead more people to support his cause, the Masters agreed a single Ranger would make for a better outcome.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA wise and old being by the time he was Temple Master of Stav Kesh, Lha-Mi was a legendary warrior of great renown on Tython. Carrying a similarly fabled sword, Lha-Mi was possessed of a kind and gentle demeanor that belied his deadly skills. Humble and balanced in the Force, Lha-Mi kept a public room at Stav Kesh filled with the photos of beings he had let down, a symbol of the imperfection of all Je'daii.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]''\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]] {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 5]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 3]] {{Vision|Xesh}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lha-Mi\n|fr=Lha-Mi\n|ru=\u041b\u0430-\u041c\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dai Bendu]]\n[[Category:Je'daii Temple Masters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Talid]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
