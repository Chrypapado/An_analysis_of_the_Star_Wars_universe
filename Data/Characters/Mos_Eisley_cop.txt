Though BoShek was indeed the perpetrator, the [[Police officer/Legends|policeman]] simply wanted a pilot scapegoat to sacrifice to the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] presence that had amassed on the [[Tatooine/Legends|planet]] in pursuit of the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']]<nowiki>'s</nowiki> jettisoned [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]].\n\nThe cop and his reinforcements chased BoShek to the [[Dowager Queen/Legends|''Dowager Queen'']] where the smuggler disguised himself as a [[The Force/Legends|Force]] preaching monk, the execution of [[Het Nkik/Legends|Het Nkik]] by [[Zeta Squadron]] below distracted the group long enough for BoShek to escape the old ship. Though the law enforcer managed to get a shot from his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], a throng of preachers now also chasing BoShek for mocking their profession provided enough cover that the man couldn't get an aim finally allowing BoShek to slip away.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[At the Crossroads: The Spacer's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
