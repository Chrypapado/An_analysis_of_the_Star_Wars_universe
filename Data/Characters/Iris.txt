She and several of her fellow leaders met with [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] after the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] promulgated labor laws that they found unsatisfactory. While they agreed to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Iris argued against doing so. Once the decision was made, she resolved to sell out the others to the Empire. The other leaders, fearing that she would do such a thing, tipped off Antilles, who sent an agent to reason with her. She instead attacked the agent, who killed her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Champions_of_the_Force#Card_gallery|cardname=Iris}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iris}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
