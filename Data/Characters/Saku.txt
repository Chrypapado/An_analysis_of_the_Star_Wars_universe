She was the granddaughter of the then village chief, and had a sister called [[Haru]].<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Biography==\nLocal raider [[Lord]] [[Izuma]], who took over much of the deserted [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] arsenal on Keelia, at one point demanded her grandfather as collateral to avoid unnecessary conflict with the villagers. [[Haru]] and her bridegroom [[Asu]] both volunteered to go in his stead, despite repeated protests from Saku. Haru and Asu's [[Marriage|wedding ceremony]] took place the night before they were to be taken. When the village gathered to eat that night, Saku and several others ended up storming off when Haru refused to back down.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nOn the day following the wedding, Haru and Asu turned themselves in to Izuma. Saku and others had secretly organized an ambush on the raiders, but their plans were foiled. When Izuma was ready to execute Saku for being the leader, the [[Jedi]] [[F]] intervened and saved her. F's companion [[Valco]] destroyed Izuma's ship, thus disabling his [[B1-series battle droid|battle droids]]. In the ensuing chaos, Izuma's associates fled. Izuma then took Haru as hostage. In a swift move, F struck down the raider, and saved Haru, Saku, and the rest of the villagers.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nSometime later, Saku and other villagers thanked F for her help, and said their farewell to F as the Jedi left the planet.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSaku was a defiant and stubborn individual. She tried to convince her sister not to sacrifice herself to Izuma and his raiders and instead advocated for resisting by fighting back. When Haru calmly accepted her fate, Saku decided to take matters into her own hands and make plans to attack their enemies. She was a capable leader, able to rally several other villagers to her cause. She wore her [[Color|blonde]] [[hair]] in a ponytail and had green earrings.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSaku first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Visions]]'' short film \"[[The Village Bride]].\" She was voiced by [[Mariya Ise]] in the original Japanese audio, and by [[Stephanie Sheh]] in the English dub.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{VisionsCite|The Village Bride}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast|text=Stunning New ''Star Wars: Visions'' Trailer Debuts}} {{1stm}}\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-visions/episode-guide-the-village-bride|text=Star Wars: Visions {{!}} \"The Village Bride\" Episode Guide}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keelia residents]]"}}}]}}}}
