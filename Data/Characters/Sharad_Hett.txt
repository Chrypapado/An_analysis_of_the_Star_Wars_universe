I knew him&hellip; a long time ago. A ''great'' Jedi.|[[Ausar Auset]]|Republic 74}}\n'''Sharad Hett''' was a powerful [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who lived during the decades of relative peace prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]]. A heroic and legendary figure in the pre-[[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Hett was well known throughout the ranks of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. He eventually grew weary of his fame and, after a disaster that destroyed his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and [[Death/Legends|killed]] his family, [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] himself to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he became the warlord of a tribe of [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]].\n\nHe sired a son, [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad Hett]], in this period, and continued to lead the Tuskens until the Jedi sent a representative to retrieve him&mdash;[[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]]. During a war between the Tuskens and the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] of Tatooine, [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] killed Sharad Hett. Honoring the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] final wish, Ki-Adi-Mundi took A'Sharad back to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] as his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]. Many decades after Sharad's death, A'Sharad would fall to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and become the infamous Darth Krayt, [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|ruler]] of the [[One Sith]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Hero===\nLike most [[Jedi/Legends|members]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] during the era, the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] Sharad Hett was given over to the Jedi by his parents while he was still an infant. Born on a world in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], its name lost to history, Hett's parents willingly allowed their child to be taken for training, proud to be among those honored families who spawned a Jedi Knight.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n[[File:SharadHett-Outlander5.png|thumb|left|180px|Sharad Hett as a Jedi]]\nInducted into the [[Jedi academy|academy]] at the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]], Sharad Hett was eventually chosen as the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Eeth Koth/Legends|Eeth Koth]]. Master Koth formed an intense bond with the dedicated and fearless young Hett, allowing him to keep in touch with his family and visit his homeworld; though his apprenticeship made it a rare treat. After years of [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] with Koth<ref name=\"SWRO\" /> and constructing his own [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Hett was elevated to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"SWRO\" /> Quickly building a legacy that surpassed even his Master's renown, Hett acquired many names while he served as a [[Jedi Guardian|Guardian]],<ref>''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''</ref> including ''Howlrunner'', the ''[[Champion of Krmar]]'', the ''[[Nemesis of Pirates]]'', the ''[[Defender of Kamparus]]'', the ''[[Hound of Worlds]]'', the ''[[Tamer of Tyrants]]'' and the ''[[Nemesis of the Kimm]]''.<ref name=\"JvS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref>\n\nAt some point, Hett had become associated with [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], whom he held in high esteem and dubbed as an \"old rascal.\"<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\nDespite his fame and prestige within the ranks of the Order, Hett grew weary, recognizing that the acclaim of his peers ran counter to the humility taught by the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]], and desired nothing else but to be with his family, whom he had all but lost contact with over the [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. After completing another dangerous mission and arriving back at the Temple, Hett turned his back on the cheering crowds of his peers and sought out Master Koth. In a corridor of the Temple, Hett confessed his desire to leave the Order to the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]]. With a tearful goodbye, Master Koth accepted Hett's resignation and the Human departed from the Temple for the last time in [[47 BBY/Legends|47 BBY]].<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\nIn a tragic twist of events, the long-awaited reunion between Hett and his family would never occur. When Hett arrived on his homeworld, he returned to death and ruin. An alliance of offworld rivals had attacked his homeworld in the time he had been gone. Every major city on the planet was razed. Millions were killed&mdash;including every member of Sharad's family.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\n===Exile===\n{{Quote|I'm a war-leader, Ki, not a king.|Sharad Hett|Star Wars: Republic: Outlander}}\n[[File:Sharad_vs_Aurra.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hett dueling with the fallen Jedi Aurra Sing.]]\nGrief-stricken, Hett left the Republic forever, voluntarily [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiling]] himself. He crash-landed on the world of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he eventually integrated himself with the local [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken]] culture. He became a feared warlord of the Sand people, and taught them new ways of fighting. Further, Hett took a wife: [[K'Sheek]], a Human woman who had been kidnapped and adopted into Tusken culture while still young. Together they had a son, [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad]], who Hett began to train in the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\nOver a decade had passed since the beginning of Hett's exile when [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] began to incite war between the Humans and Tuskens of Tatooine as a way to sell off his stock of antiquated [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]]. Sharad Hett, seeing no other option, led the Tusken tribes in the war. He was able to prevent the worst of the atrocities from occurring, and minimized civilian casualties. Nevertheless, he became a feared figure amongst the non-Tuskens of Tatooine and footage of what appeared to be a lightsaber-wielding Tusken reached the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where Hett's former colleagues were amazed to see that he still lived.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n[[File:Sing_kills_Sharad_Hett.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sharad Hett is killed by Aurra Sing.]]\nThe [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] sent Master [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]] to bring back Hett- reasoning that Mundi was the only Jedi skilled enough to defeat the rogue Jedi in a duel who would not be tainted by memories of any past friendships. Mundi found both Hett as well as young A'Sharad, who rescued the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] from a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]]. Hett had hoped that when the Council sent an emissary to find him, it would be Qui-Gon Jinn; he felt some anguish upon hearing of his murder. But despite giving Hett the surprising news of the [[Order of the Sith Lords|reborn]] [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] threat, Mundi still could not convince his fellow Jedi to return to Coruscant. Hett believed his place was on Tatooine, with the Tuskens.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\nEventually, due to intelligence gathered by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]], both [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla the Elder]] and Jabba launched a surprise assault on the main Tusken camp. As promised, Hett led his people into battle, but was confronted by Aurra Sing. The Tusken easily blocked the bounty hunter's attacks but a quick [[Dun M\u00f6ch/Legends|Dun M\u00f6ch]] distraction gave Sing the opportunity she needed to plunge her lightsaber into his chest. Before dying, Hett made Ki-Adi-Mundi promise to accept his son, A'Sharad, into the Jedi Order, and to train him as his own Padawan; Ki-Adi-Mundi agreed. Hett's last words were to note that, while he had not known his own parents, he was honored to have known his son.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:Sharad_Jedi-Training.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The young Hett is trained by his master, Eeth Koth.]]\nIt was believed that Sharad Hett would have advanced to the level of Jedi Master if he had not imposed exile on himself. He was highly skilled at [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]] and was able to easily fend off [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]]. In fact Sing only managed to defeat him by using the [[Dun M\u00f6ch/Legends|Dun M\u00f6ch]] technique. He was also skilled with the Force. In addition, Hett was an expert in harsh environmental survival tactics and this helped him when he lived with the Tusken Raiders. He successfully adapted to Tusken wildlife and the harsh desert.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\n===Hett's lightsaber===\n{{Quote|His&hellip;I'm certain of it.|Ki-Adi-Mundi, recognizing the hilt of Sharad Hett's weapon|Star Wars: Republic: Outlander}}\nSharad Hett used a lightsaber during his career as a Jedi Knight, which was at his side even in self-imposed exile on Tatooine. Although the color of the blade could have varied during his time as a Jedi, the blade was crimson red in color during Sharad's time as a warlord.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n[[File:Sharad_Hett_saber.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sharad Hett's lightsaber]]\nWhen a report reached the Jedi Temple in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] of a Tusken Raider wielding the lightsaber while leading a massive Tusken war band, the saber correlated to a historical [[Hologram/Legends|holorecording]] of Sharad Hett. Due to Hett's fame, it was instantly recognizable to many Jedi including [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] and Eeth Koth, who trained him. It was this clue that led the Jedi to identify the Sand Person seen wielding it as Hett himself.<ref name=\"SWRO\" />\n\nBefore becoming one with the Force, Sharad Hett gave his lightsaber to his son, A'Sharad Hett, who would in turn wield it throughout the Clone Wars. However, decades later, A'Sharad Hett pledged himself to the Sith and became Darth Krayt, named after the [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] on Tatooine. It is not known if the weapon was still in his possession at that time.<ref>''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Sharad Hett}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 7|''Star Wars'' (1998) 7]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 9|''Star Wars'' (1998) 9]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 10|''Star Wars'' (1998) 10]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 11|''Star Wars'' (1998) 11]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 12|''Star Wars'' (1998) 12]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 13|''Star Wars'' (1998) 13]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 15|''Star Wars'' (1998) 15]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 28|''Star Wars'' (1998) 28]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 30|''Star Wars'' (1998) 30]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 31|''Star Wars'' (1998) 31]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Republic 59|''Republic'' 59]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Siege of Saleucami]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 15|''Legacy'' (2006) 15]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 16|''Legacy'' (2006) 16]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 18|''Legacy'' (2006) 18]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 1]]'' {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Around the Galaxy|Around the Galaxy: Dark Horse Unmasks The Phantom Menace}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Power of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|131|HET1-4, ''A'Sharad Hett''}}\n*{{FFCite|140|KOT3-4, ''Eeth Koth''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[Star Wars Fandex Deluxe Edition]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.5]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|135|Mon Mothma's 5 Facts}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sharad Hett#legends\n|es=Sharad Hett\n|ja=\u30b7\u30e3\u30e9\u30c9\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30c8\n|nl=Sharad Hett\n|pl=Sharad Hett\n|pt=Legends:Sharad Hett\n|ru=\u0428\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0425\u0435\u0442\u0442\n|deFA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hett, Sharad}}\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raiders]]\n[[Category:Warlords]]"}}}]}}}}
