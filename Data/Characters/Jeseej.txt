The owner of the restaurant [[Zlato's Place]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Jeseej used it as a front for his forgery business. He was very knowledgeable about the [[Coruscant underworld]] and had a reputation among his clients for being trustworthy and providing useful information. A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], Jeseej also granted clients readings of their future for a fee.\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Sljee (species)|Sljee]] Jeseej had for [[Time/Legends|years]] owned the restaurant [[Zlato's Place]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Zlato's Place specialized in [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] dishes, and a dozen Toydarians worked there. However, this restaurant was merely a front for Jeseej's forgery company, and as such, he was comfortable with the fact that the restaurant consistently failed to make a profit. In addition to the twelve Toydarians, Jeseej employed [[Unidentified Squib forgers|two]] [[Squib/Legends|Squibs]] able to duplicate an [[Identichip/Legends|ID card]] in less than an [[Standard hour/Legends|hour]] and had a reputation as a skilled forger. In order to meet with the Sljee, a client had to give the correct password to Jessej's Toydarian host, and then pick a certain entr\u00e9e off a special menu. Only then would the individual be led to see Jeseej in a small room beyond the kitchen.<ref name=\"core\" />\n\nJeseej was also [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and ran a side business as a [[fortune teller]], using his connection to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to predict the future for clients of the [[Coruscant underworld]]. These customers found his premonitions to be trustworthy, and many of them began focusing their [[Black market/Legends|black-market]] operations around his predictions. Jeseej had a great deal of knowledge about the Coruscant Underworld and was happy to share information in exchange for a healthy sum of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. He was very careful to avoid attracting the attention of [[Planet/Legends|planetary]] security officials, cautiously running his businesses in secrecy.<ref name=\"core\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nOne of the few Sljee on Coruscant, Jeseej was very well-versed in the Coruscant underlevels. He had a strong will and was skilled at gathering information. Due to this, he gained a reputation as a talented and trustworthy forger and [[Information broker/Legends|information dealer]] who provided useful news. As a fortune teller, Jeseej was highly valued, and his clients found his premonitions to be advantageous and uncannily accurate. His restaurant employees were very loyal to him. Though his restaurant was unprofitable, Jeseej was unconcerned, as its true goal was to serve as a front for his less-than-legal dealings.<ref name=\"core\" />\n\nLike all Sljee, Jeseej was blind, forcing him to require on his sense of touch and hearing. He resembled a [[gray]] table with tentacles and stumpy [[Limb/Legends|legs]], a trait shared by all members of his [[Species/Legends|species]]. Like other Sljee, he was easily mistaken for a motile plant or a sort of bizarre animal. He could speak both [[Sljee language|Sljee]] and [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]], was skilled at repairing machines, and had knowledge of organic biology.<ref name=\"core\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJeseej was created for the [[2003]] sourcebook ''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''. However, his first [[canon]]ical mention was in an [[Wizards.com|online]] article by [[Wizards of the Coast]] titled ''[[Jeseej and the Sljee]]'', a preview of ''Coruscant and the Core Worlds''. Jeseej later received an entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', published in [[2008]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030102ccw|text=Jeseej and the Sljee|int=Jeseej and the Sljee|archivedate=20090806042746}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Forgers]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sljee]]"}}}]}}}}
