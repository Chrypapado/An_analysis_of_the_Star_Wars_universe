She was rescued by a Republic individual who sent by her father to rescue her.<ref>{{TORcite|type=general|The Servant Girl|Alderaan}}</ref>\n\nWhen the individual confronted the Rist guards at her cell, Andra flippantly told them that the former was a friend of hers and that they were outmatched. The guards threatened to kill Andra if the spacer made a move but they were all killed before they could carry out their threat.
