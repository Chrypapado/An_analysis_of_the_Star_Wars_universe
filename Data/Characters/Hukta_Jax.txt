Around [[3956 BBY]], he held the position of Sector Champion, having raced on the [[Ahto City swoop track]], until Revan beat his record. Revan helped [[Queedle Molto]], who couldn't seem to win anything else besides third, by giving him [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to repair and enhance his [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] bike. Molto ended up shattering Jax's time and became the new Sector Champion. Jax remained in second until Revan beat his time, along with Molto's, becoming the new Champion, and Hukta was knocked down to third.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHukta Jax wasn't popular even when he was Sector Champion, partly because of his behavior, but mostly because his racing methods were considered boring among most swoop fans. Another racer, a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] named [[Casandra Mateil]], exclaimed \"All he does is run over everything!\" He had earned the admiration of a female [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] soldier thinking of his racing style as \"brute force to the finish.\" As the stereotype of most Gamorreans, he was belligerent, mean, and boastful.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nShould Revan not help Molto, and instead reaches second place, he is told to talk to Jax before going for first. Jax warns Revan not to attempt to go for his title. Revan ignored the warning and became the Champion. Jax could do nothing, as violence in Ahto City was not tolerated by the [[Selkath/Legends|Selkath]] officials. However, the Gamorrean promised Revan that he will find an opportunity to take vengeance. Despite this threat he is never encountered again in the game.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Manaan Sector Swoop Race Champion\n|years=?&ndash;[[3956 BBY]]\n|before=\n|after=[[Queedle Molto]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hukta Jax\n|pl=Hukta Jax\n|ru=\u0425\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u0430\u043a\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jax, Hukta}}\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]"}}}]}}}}
