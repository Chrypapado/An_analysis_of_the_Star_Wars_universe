Denied admission to the first university of his choice, he ended up attending a lesser school, where he took politics as a secondary course of study. He excelled at those political courses, but failed those scientific courses associated with exploring, so he chose to begin a career of public service. He thought that the recently discovered [[Cularin system]] might offer him the chance to follow both fields.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nShortly after coming to Gadrin, Chistor talked his way onto a [[scout vessel]] leaving on an expedition to [[Uffel]]. He discovered that exploring was too much like work, and was not comfortable. He returned to Gadrin and entered politics full time, maneuvering into the governor's position.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nHe became a good governor, having in mind the needs of his subjects and learning about local matters such as the native [[Tarasin]]s. He enjoyed his job, and attempted to keep his constituents as uninterested in politics as possible, which in Gadrin was easy. A real election had not been held in over thirty years by the time of the [[Trade Wars]].<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nPossibly due to his Alderaanian upbringing, Chistor was very interested in galactic high culture. He spent public funding on bringing in concerts, operas, dance recitals, and holotheatres, even though the rest of Gadrin did not seem that interested, and rival city [[Hedrett]], equipped with a spaceport, had a quicker access to cultural novelties. He tried to keep in shape, though his easy life did put some weight onto him. He kept his hair short, and his blue eyes had been described as \"piercing.\"<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Chistor called for a celebration in Gadrin after the [[Metatheran Cartel]] forces of [[Velin Wir]] were defeated by the [[Cularin resistance]], and Wir's illegal activities exposed. Chistor granted medals to the leaders of the resistance, as well as to a group of heroes who had assisted them. The Cartel declared that Velin Wir had been a rogue, and that they were looking for more corrupt agents in their staff to uproot them.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref> Later, they sent [[Thurm Loogg]] as a new envoy, asking for permission to reestablish offices on Cularin's surface.<ref name=\"AUP\">''[[An Uneasy Peace]]''</ref>\n\nChistor left the matter up to a vote of the people attending the celebration, but when that vote came up a tie, Chistor decided to refuse the Cartel's request.<ref name=\"AUP\" /> This refusal probably applied only to Gadrin, but Hedrett was likely to follow his lead. As these were the only settlements allowed on the planet's surface by the [[Cularin Compact]], it kept the Cartel off the surface, though they probably could have turned to one of the [[Platform city|platform cities]].\n\nIn about [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> Governor Chistor traveled to the [[Almas Academy]], to take part in a private ceremony of gratitude towards the heroes who defeated slaver [[Phylus Mon]].<ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[An Uneasy Peace]]''\n*''[[Oblivion's Kiss]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Quarters]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Halves]]''\n*''[[Holes]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Peaces]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Here and Thaere]]''\n*''[[Operation Blue Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020207blanius&c=swlfc|text=Discussions With Lanius|int=Discussions With Lanius|archivedate=20030813172935}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030821loog|text=Thurm Loogg Speaks|int=Thurm Loogg Speaks|archivedate=20091016050751}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040513|text=Insecurities|int=Insecurities|archivedate=20091015234848}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040603|text=Political Platforms|int=Political Platforms|archivedate=20080503151316}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060202FadedColors|text=Faded Colors|int=Faded Colors|archivedate=20090603045532}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040722|text=Lockdown|int=Lockdown (article)|archivedate=20090603045750}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041209|text=Tramsig's Plan|int=Tramsig's Plan|archivedate=20091016001955}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060126Calm|text=The Calm Before the Storm|int=The Calm Before the Storm|archivedate=20090603045712}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chistor, Barnab}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
