However, a picture of Dhas Vedij from around [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]] depicts a man older than twenty. This means that Vedij had to have served in the [[Republic Navy]] at some time.</ref>\n**[[Republic Navy]]<ref name=\"Note\" />\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n[[Baron/Legends|Baron]] '''Ronnan Tyla Vedij''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] from a wealthy [[Vedij family|family]] who was part of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Republic Navy|navy]]. Vedij quickly obtained the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]], and later retired on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] while his two sons, [[Dhas Fenoep Vedij]] and [[Elon Vedij]], served in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], the Republic's successor state. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Vedij was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a traffic accident on Coruscant that Dhas believed was engineered by his [[Parent/Legends|father's]] enemies because the Baron had spoken out against the reworking of the Imperial [[Navy/Legends|Navy]].\n\n==Biography==\nRonnan Tyla Vedij was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] into a position of considerable wealth, and had [[Vedij family|family]] holdings on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. A [[Baron/Legends|Baron]], [[Gender/Legends|he]] chose to join<ref name=\"Orbit\" /> the [[Republic Navy|navy]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]],<ref name=\"Note\" /> and, unlike his ancestors, took a [[Space warfare|combat]]-related role instead of buying a safe position. Vedij led a distinguished career in the [[Navy/Legends|navy]], and once, when he was a [[Bosun/Legends|bosun]], [[Unidentified battle (Ronnan Tyla Vedij)|suffered]] heavy wounds at the hands of [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Pirate/Legends|commerce raiders]]. Vedij managed to deter the assault by himself, and this event caused him to be promoted to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Captain/Legends|captain]]. Vedij later became an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]], and while he was still in the navy, had two sons, [[Dhas Fenoep Vedij|Dhas]] and [[Elon Vedij]], with his [[Ronnan Tyla Vedij's wife|wife]].<ref name=\"Orbit\" />\n\nThe Baron Admiral retired to Coruscant, and Vedij brought his sons up to believe in a strong military, something that was also believed by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], the Republic's successor state. Dhas later joined the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], and was followed some [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later by Elon. When Imperial [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] began to retool the [[Imperial Military/Legends|military]], Vedij became a vocal opponent of this movement. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], shortly after Dhas was transferred to the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]] ''[[Far Orbit]]'', Vedij and his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] were [[Death/Legends|killed]] on Coruscant in a traffic accident, following a [[Robo-Hack]] misinterpreting routing instructions which caused it to go in the opposite direction. After Dhas, who inquired into the nature of the crash, was warned away by the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]], he believed that his [[Parent/Legends|father]] had been killed by the enemies he had made by opposing the retooling of the military. Dhas later led a [[Mutiny on the Far Orbit|mutiny]] on the ''Far Orbit'' because of the deaths of both his father and brother, who died [[Battle of the Silent Blades|fighting]] pirates shortly after Vedij.<ref name=\"Orbit\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA man who believed in a strong military, Vedij chose to enter the line of combat in the navy instead of buying a safe position. Vedij was also a vocal opponent of Palpatine's changes to the military of the Empire.<ref name=\"Orbit\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRonnan Tyla Vedij was first mentioned in [[1998]]'s ''[[The Far Orbit Project]]'', by [[Timothy S. O'Brien]]. The book was a supplement to [[West End Games]]'s ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication ''[[Pirates & Privateers]]'', carrying on that book's theme by following the [[Privateer/Legends|privateering]] [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] ''Far Orbit''. Although Vedij is not identified as a Human in the book, this article assumes he is because his sons were Human.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Far Orbit Project]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vedij, Ronnan Tyla}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy admirals]]"}}}]}}}}
