He later became head of the [[Exchange]] criminal organization on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] and traveled with the Jedi Exile, [[Meetra Surik]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Pazaak bores me. I often suspect my opponent of cheating. I prefer predictable games, such as galactic economics.|G0-T0 to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nTo oversee and aid in the [[Planet/Legends|planetary]] reconstruction of the planet [[Telos IV]], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] spent a great deal of credits to design a technical droid to handle the immense data that was produced daily: climate changes, shield management reports, etc. This droid was known as G0-T0. Known to few, however, was that the droid also had a secondary duty: to aid in the reconstruction of the Republic, which was wounded from the aftermath of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. To accomplish this task, it had two directives:\n\n*Produce options to rebuild the Republic.\n*Follow all the laws of the Republic.\n\nWorking for quite a long time to accomplish its duties on Telos, the droid found itself unable to follow both of its prime directives. Every practical option that would help rebuild the Republic would require breaking a law of the Republic. At that moment, the droid \"broke.\" Choosing to follow only the first directive, the droid began to enact plans to save the Republic, regardless of their legality.\n\nEventually building a jet-black orb of a body, G0-T0 began to set up as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] ring on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Since few would believe a droid could run an elaborate smuggling operation, G0-T0 used a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] emitter to create the identity of \"Goto.\" Instead of being the smuggling operator itself, G0-T0 would simply be Goto's liaison. G0-T0 set up the hologram by reusing a number of holovid gangster clich\u00e9s. Taken together, the illusion was so effective that few, if any, knew of Goto's true existence, although Meetra Surik guessed it.\n[[File:Gotoattacksremote.jpg|thumb|left|G0-T0 attacks the remote.]]\nG0-T0's actions, while illegal, did aid the Republic in rebuilding itself. Its smuggling ring caused the deaths of destabilizing persons or organizations, developed unofficial profits for entire sectors, and strengthened Republic worlds that would otherwise have been poor and ignored. Believing also that the major source of the Republic's problems revolved around the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]/[[Sith/Legends|Sith]] conflict, it also enacted bounties for live Jedi and Sith. Many [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], who misinterpreted the bounty, simply killed Jedi and Sith instead of capturing them, failing to realize that they were worth nothing to G0-T0 dead. It was searching for a live Jedi or Sith to aid him in preserving the Republic. At some point he also discovered the [[HK Manufacturing Plant|HK-50 manufacturing facility]] hidden on Telos and reactivated it, disseminating the new model assassin droids throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] searching for the Jedi.<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" />\n\nEventually, Meetra Surik was captured under the Jedi bounty. Goto spoke with Surik briefly on the bridge of his [[Visionary|yacht]], which orbited Nar Shaddaa, requesting the Jedi's help in the preservation of the Republic. They were interrupted by the ship's alarm, which had been set off by Surik's companions, who had invaded the ship seeking to rescue Surik. After succeeding in this and in gaining control of the droid-operated ship, they deactivated its [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]], allowing it to be destroyed by the many enemies of Goto, who had been unable to locate the mysterious ship before. G0-T0 presented himself to Surik on the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', but as Goto's \"gift\"&mdash;not Goto himself. He requested Surik's aid in stabilizing the planets Telos, [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], and [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]. G0-T0 found himself increasingly annoyed by another spheroid droid aboard the ''Hawk'': [[Bao-Dur]]'s tiny [[Bao-Dur's remote|remote]] droid. G0-T0, in a response, disabled the Remote and reprogrammed him for his own agenda.\n\nG0-T0 used his modifications to the Remote on the planet of [[Malachor V]]. G0-T0 guessed that Bao-Dur's Remote was intended to recharge the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] on the planet, destroying it entirely. The smuggling robot felt that the planet contained too many priceless artifacts to destroy, and attempted to stop the Remote from activating the weapon by locking the Remote from moving due to G0-T0's modifications. However, [[HK-47]] and his new allies, [[HK-50 series assassin droid|HK-50 droids]], foiled G0-T0's plans and destroyed him.<ref name=\"NEGtD\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''</ref> When Surik gave Bao-Dur's Remote the signal to activate the Mass Shadow Generator, Surik escaped with her companions on the ''Ebon Hawk'' while Malachor V was obliterated. G0-T0's [[Photoreceptor/Legends|photoreceptor]] was recovered, however, and by the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3642 BBY]], was stored in the vaults of the treasure ship [[King's Ransom (treasury ship)|''King's Ransom'']], which belonged to the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|true Sith Empire]]. The photoreceptor was then stolen along with various other treasures by a [[Voidhound|smuggler]] working as a Republic [[Privateer/Legends|privateer]]. G0-T0 also had a secret lair on Onderon&mdash;which was guarded by several traps&mdash;that was discovered during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]].<ref name=\"Mission\">{{TORcite|type=crewskill|Treasure Hunting|Go Forth}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You would be surprised how little I care what you think.|G0-T0 to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nBefitting a planning droid, G0-T0 held efficiency in high value. Due to this, he found his directive to rebuild the Republic distasteful. In G0-T0's view, the Republic was an inefficient system bloated with bureaucracy and built on bad decisions, and an optimal solution in his opinion would have been to scrap the entire government and enact a new one. However, he was forced to follow his directive to help maintain the continued existence of the Republic. The same desire for efficiency and for rebuilding the Republic was also why G0-T0 took an interest in the Jedi Exile. As history showed several instances of even a single Jedi being capable of causing great changes on an interstellar scale, G0-T0 considered the Jedi Exile a valuable asset to have on his side.\n\nOnce free from following the laws of the Republic, G0-T0 displayed a decidedly amoral personality. He had no problem having people killed if they stood in the way of his plans, and referred to it as \"deleting\" people. In fact, he came to enjoy his position as a [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]], free of following Republic bureaucracy and seeing his actions have fast and clear effects.\n\nG0-T0 displayed an understanding of psychology uncommon for droids. Knowing that most organics considered droids inferior and were unlikely to take orders from one, he constructed the persona of Goto to work around this issue. He modeled its personality after holovid villains, and was surprised at how well that worked. G0-T0 also had a new body built for himself, and placed special emphasis on giving it an intimidating appearance.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:G0T0-NEGD.jpg|thumb|right|220px|G0-T0 and the [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of \"Goto\"]]\nG0-T0 was created by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] as one of the companions for the [[2004]] [[Xbox]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''. Like most companions, he was written by [[Chris Avellone]].<ref name=\"15 Years\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.cinelinx.com/news/culture/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-developer-chris-avellone-discusses-the-games-impact-15-years-later/|title=Knights of the Old Republic II Developer Chris Avellone Discusses the Game's Impact 15 Years Later|author=Maison, Jordan|date=2019-12-06|publisher=Cinelinx|quote=I had to write almost all the companions, except for Mandalore and Bao-Dur (who was written by Michael Chu[)]|archivedate=20191208220416}}</ref> He is voiced by [[Daran Norris]].\n\nThe name \"G0-T0\" and the droid's alter ego of \"Goto\" are presumably a reference to the infamous [[Wikipedia:GOTO|GOTO]] programming command, which, if misused, can result in \"[[Wikipedia:Spaghetti code|spaghetti code]]\" that is difficult to debug and maintain. This led some fans to speculate that G0-T0's [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] alignment (with a score of 30) within the game is a reference to the [[Wikipedia:Considered harmful|\"GOTO is evil\"]] belief expressed by proponents of [[Wikipedia:Structured programming|structured programming]].\n\nG0-T0's appearance in the game was noticeably similar to the [[IT-O Interrogator]] droid from [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], although G0-T0 sports a red bulb in the upper half of his body as opposed to the IT-O's bulb in the lower half. In ''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]'', G0-T0 is depicted upside-down, bringing the droid's look even closer to IT-O. Notably, G0-T0's eye is that of the HAL-9000 supercomputer from the movie [[Wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], only the reflections of the ceiling lights from the ship in the movie have been placed at the bottom of the eye.\n\n===Cut content===\nTo the chagrin of some players, the result of the G0-T0/Remote conflict is not shown onscreen. If the player chooses to progress through the game in accordance with the light side, it is assumed that G0-T0 fails in his attempt to destroy the Remote, and thus the planet is destroyed by the Mass Shadow Generator. However, if the player chooses the path of the dark side for Meetra Surik to walk, the planet remains intact.\n\nSome of this outcome may have been elaborated in levels set in the [[HK Manufacturing Plant]], which were left out of the game's final cut. G0-T0 does admit that he hired the [[HK-50 series assassin droid|HK-50 assassin droids]] to hunt Surik, and HK-47 reveals the droids will not stop the hunt until their factory is destroyed. Ironically, this also reveals that, in spite of his claims Surik's actions at Peragus \"broke\" the galaxy, G0-T0 himself can largely be blamed for having just as big a role in the destruction of the Peragus mining facility, as the chain of events kicked off by the HK-50 aboard the ''Harbinger''&mdash;which led to the facility's sabotage by the HK and contributed largely to its destruction&mdash;was all caused by G0-T0's sending the HK-50 units after Surik in the first place. In the deleted levels, HK-47 was supposed to come to an agreement with [[HK-51 series assassin droid|HK-51 droids]], the successors of the HK-50s, so that these droids would destroy G0-T0 during the finale's G0-T0/Remote standoff. Later, ''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]'' reintroduced this particular cutscene into canon, although HK-51s were replaced with HK-50s. It is unknown what would have happened to G0-T0 in the non-canon dark-side ending of the game, except that the Mass Shadow Generator would not have been activated. Many fans speculate from the sound files left in the game disk that in the non-canon dark-side ending, HK-47 arrives with the HK-51 droids and they destroy the Remote instead, or GO-TO uses his ability to re-write HK-47's programming to destroy Remote.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of G0-T0}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Codex}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook]]'' <!--p.209-->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{K2char}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=G0-T0#legends\n|es=G0-T0\n|hu=G0-T0\n|pl=G0-T0\n|ru=G0-T0\n}}\n\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:G0-T0 infrastructure planning systems]]\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
