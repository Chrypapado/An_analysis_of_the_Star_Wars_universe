''Echoes of the Jedi'' itself can be dated to about [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]] because the adventure states that [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vhiin Thorla]] traveled to the [[Almas Academy]] two years after the declaration of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], an event that ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. As ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' establishes that Darsin [[Sith training|trained]] under Rivan and [[Death/Legends|died]] during Rivan's reign, Darsin's service to Rivan and ultimate death can therefore be dated to between 1417 BBY and 1167 BBY.</ref>\n|species=[[Human/Legends|Human]]<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n|gender=[[Gender/Legends|Male]]<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n|height=\n|mass=\n|hair=\n|eyes=\n|skin=\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=[[Sith/Legends|Sith]]<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n|masters=[[Darth Rivan]]<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n|apprentices=}}\n{{Quote|Please, powerful Jedi, be merciful! Do not destroy the poor, lost, weak-willed fool enslaved by Darth Rivan all those centuries ago!|Darsin, to the Heroes of Cularin|A Mon Alone}}\n'''Darsin''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served as the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Rivan]] during the [[New Sith Wars]]. He resided in [[Almas Sith fortress|Rivan's Sith fortress]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], where his [[Sith Master/Legends|master]] subjected him to experiments and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] rituals. Darsin eventually came close to attaining the rank of [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and planned to assume the name '''Darth Malus''', but before he could become a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Lord/Legends|Lord]], he [[Death/Legends|died]] as a result of Rivan's [[Sith alchemy/Legends|alchemical]] manipulations. Darsin's consciousness survived as an incorporeal [[Force ghost|Sith spirit]], and Rivan bound him to act as a guardian of the Sith [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]]. [[Standard century/Legends|Centuries]] later, in about [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]], the Human [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Karae Nalvas]] and several of their minions [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|ventured]] into the Sith fortress in search of the secrets of the creation of [[Sith battlelord]]s, a class of warrior developed by Rivan, and their incursion caused Darsin to re-awaken. The Sith spirit attacked the interlopers, but was warded off by the power of the [[Darkstaff]], a [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that was carried by Mon. Shortly thereafter, Darsin ambushed a band of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] who had ventured into the fortress in the wake of Phlyus Mon's intrusion, and he was defeated by them.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I served him in life. I serve him in death.

At some point between about 1417 BBY and 1167 BBY,<ref name=\"Date\" /> Darsin became the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Rivan]] and [[Sith training|studied]] the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. He lived with Rivan inside the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord's]] [[Almas Sith fortress|fortress]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]] in the [[Cularin system]], and there, the Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] subjected Darsin to dark side rituals and performed [[Sith alchemy/Legends|alchemical]] experiments on him, treating Darsin as little more than a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]]. To reflect Darsin's lowly position, a small, uncomfortable lump of rough [[Granite/Legends|granite]] was installed inside the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]] next to Rivan's throne, for Darsin to sit on and [[Meditation/Legends|meditate]].<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\n[[File:Darthriv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Darth Rivan]]\nDarsin eventually betrayed [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Rivan<ref name=\"Sith Battlelords\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050901sithbattlelords|text=Sith Battlelords|int=Sith Battlelords (article)|archivedate=20100520071449}}</ref> and came close to becoming a Dark Lord of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. He planned to assume the honorific \"Darth\" and rename himself \"Darth Malus\" on usurping Rivan's position, but before he could ascend to the rank of Sith Lord, Darsin [[Death/Legends|died]] as a result of the damage that had been done to his body by Rivan's experiments. His corpse was interred inside a [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Marble/Legends|marble]] [[sarcophagus]] in a specially constructed crypt that had been built for Darsin and Rivan in the depths of the Almas fortress, but Darsin's consciousness lived on as an incorporeal [[Force ghost|Sith spirit]]. Through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Rivan bound his former apprentice to the [[Force nexus|dark side presence]] that permeated the fortress, and Darsin was compelled to act as a guardian of the stronghold and attack intruders.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\nRivan was later [[Battle of Almas|driven]] away from Almas by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], and the Sith fortress was abandoned.<ref name=\"LFCG\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Darsin lay undisturbed for centuries.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" /> Circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] slaver [[Phylus Mon]] and the Human [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Karae Nalvas]] traveled to Almas along with several of their minions and [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|explored]] the Sith fortress. They came in search of the secrets of the creation of [[Sith battlelord]]s, a class of warrior leader developed by Darth Rivan that were [[Force bond|bonded]] to their [[Troop/Legends|troops]] via the Force. When the party accessed a secret chamber inside the fortress in which the rites involved in the making of Sith battlelords had been recorded, Darsin's spirit was re-awakened and he attacked them. However, Mon used the [[Darkstaff]]&mdash;a powerful [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that the Chevin had been lent by the criminal [[Len Markus]]&mdash;to ward off the ghost, and Darsin watched helplessly as Mon and Nalvas made a failed attempt to perform the Sith battlelord rituals. Due to the artifact's presence, Darsin was unable to prevent Mon from leaving the fortress with one of Rivan's Sith [[Book/Legends|tomes]], much to the spirit's dismay.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Order hired the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a renowned team of freelance [[Agent/Legends|agents]], to investigate the disappearance of some [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] who had been captured by Mon's entourage, and two [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] after Mon's incursion, the operatives made their way to the lower levels of the Sith fortress. Darsin observed the agents as they moved through the fortress, and he planned to ambush them.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\n{{RPG|''[[A Mon Alone]]''}}\nWhen the agents entered the fortress' crypt, Darsin pounced on them, attempting to strike them down with six [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] that he wielded simultaneously through the Force. However, the agents overcame the spirit and threatened to use the [[Force power/Legends|power]] [[Force Light]] to destroy him. Darsin begged for mercy and told them about Mon's doings in the fortress, and the agents agreed to spare the spirit.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I am what I am. I do not want to go to rest, I merely want to be free once more. If you have never been a slave, you cannot understand the torment of the dark, alone.|Darsin, to the Heroes of Cularin|A Mon Alone}}\nA weak-willed individual, Darsin was happy to take unfair advantage of others, and he had no qualms against lying to people or being manipulative to achieve his aims. Following his death, Darsin became corrupted by the dark side of the Force to a greater extent than he had been when he was alive, and he became vengeful, attacking intruders who entered the Sith fortress. He disliked being tied to the fortress' dark side aura and he sought to be freed so that he could go where he pleased. When Darsin was re-awakened by Phylus Mon's violation of the Sith fortress, the spirit was enraged by the Chevin's actions, as he believed that Mon had no right to steal Darth Rivan's secrets and because Mon was carrying the Darkstaff, which had been feared by Rivan more than anything else. The spirit felt humiliated when Mon countered his attack, and he became angry at himself, because he could not pursue Mon's party beyond the bounds of the Sith fortress and kill them. Darsin feared the Heroes of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] when he encountered them shortly after Mon's intrusion, because he realized that they could potentially destroy him. As a spirit, Darsin manifested himself clad in flowing, black-colored [[Robe/Legends|robes]].<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDarsin was trained in the use of [[Sith magic|Sith sorcery]], and he was able to use the Force to [[Force sense/Legends|sense]] the world around him, to [[Telekinesis/Legends|move objects]], to [[Mind trick/Legends|affect]] the minds of others, to [[Force healing/Legends|heal himself]], to enhance his strength and to [[Force drain/Legends|drain]] Force energy. In addition, he was proficient in the use of the powers [[battlemind]], [[Force rage]], [[Force stealth]] and [[Hatred]]. In his incorporeal, spirit form, Darsin could not be harmed by physical attacks, and he could [[teleport]] himself at will to different locations within the Sith fortress. Before his death, Darsin imbued the [[Lightsaber crystal|crystals]] of six lightsabers with his essence; after he became a ghost, he was able to temporarily extend his presence into the weapons and wield them in combat. Due to a combination of the experiments that were performed on him by Darth Rivan and the dark side presence that pervaded the Sith fortress, Darsin had a greater power and control over his environment than did normal Sith spirits, a strength further enhanced after he was exposed to the Darkstaff.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDarsin was created by [[Morrie Mullins (person)|Morrie Mullins]] for ''[[A Mon Alone]]'', a [[2004]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|role-playing]] adventure that formed part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" /> The character was later referenced in the article [[Sith Battlelords (article)|''Sith Battlelords'']], a tie-in to ''A Mon Alone'' that was written by Mullins and published on [[Wizards.com]].<ref name=\"Sith Battlelords\" /> In [[2007]], he received a further mention in the [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] module ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=Echoes of the Jedi|int=Echoes of the Jedi|archivedate=20100118064618}}</ref>\n\nIn ''A Mon Alone'', the player characters role-play as the Heroes of Cularin, and the decisions they take impact Darsin's actions and ultimate fate. If the player characters spend a long [[Time/Legends|time]] in the fortress' [[Library/Legends|library]], Darsin attacks them there, rather than in the stronghold's crypt, while if they respond to a call made to them by a voice in the fortress' ritual chamber for the agents to promise themselves to the dark side, they can be possessed by Darsin. If the player characters use the power Force Light to dissipate the fortress' dark side taint, Darsin ceases to be bound to the fortress and flees. Alternately, it is possible for the players either to destroy Darsin or to let him remain in the fortress in peace.<ref name=\"A Mon Alone\" /> ''Echoes of the Jedi'' later established that in the canon outcome of the encounter, the player characters defeated Darsin, but the adventure did not provide any further clarification of the canon events of the altercation.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" /> The body of this article depicts the outcome where the player characters agree to spare Darsin.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]'' {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=Echoes of the Jedi|int=Echoes of the Jedi|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050901sithbattlelords|text=Sith Battlelords|int=Sith Battlelords (article)|archivedate=20100520071449}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0414\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Force ghosts]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sith acolytes and apprentices]]\n[[Category:Sith of the New Sith Wars]]"}}}]}}}}
