What are you doing in here? You can't just come barging into someone's home!|Dia, meeting [[Revan/Legends|Revan]].|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Dia''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], when she worked as a [[Waiter/Legends|waitress]] in [[Javyar's Cantina]]. While working there, a man named [[Holdan]] began forcing himself on her; in retaliation, she struck him with her [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], injuring and humiliating him. Holdan responded by putting a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on Dia's head, forcing her to hide in an [[Upper City]] [[South Apartments|apartment]]. While hiding out there, she met the Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who took it upon himself to convince Holdan to drop the bounty.\n\n==Biography==\n===Confrontation with Holdan===\n{{Quote|He gets drunk and tries to force himself on me, and I get a bounty put on my head for defending myself? Where's the justice in that?|Dia about her confrontation with Holdan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Holdan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Holdan, an associate of Davik Kang, drunkenly harassed Dia.]]\nDia lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[City/Legends|city]]-[[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> during the [[Old Sith Wars]], a period of conflict between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and various [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] factions.<ref name=\"Sith\">{{CSWECite|II|407|Old Sith Wars}}</ref> During the [[Jedi Civil War]] between the Republic and the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Darth Revan]], Dia was working as a [[Waiter/Legends|waitress]] at [[Javyar's Cantina]] in the [[Lower City]]. One day, [[Gender/Legends|she]] caught the attention of a man named [[Holdan]], a henchman for the [[Exchange]]{{'s}} local crime boss, [[Davik Kang]]. When the drunk man attempted to force himself upon her, Dia defended herself with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], humiliating him in front of his friends and giving him a scar. To maintain his reputation, he put out an illegal [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] of three hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] on Dia, and the woman was reduced to hiding in an [[Upper City]] [[South Apartments|apartment]] amongst illegal aliens. Because of Holdan's connections to Kang, the local authorities turned a blind eye. She barely made enough credits to get by, and thus was unable to pay off the bounty. Too afraid for her life to leave the apartment, Dia soon lost touch with the political affairs of the outside world.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Removing the bounty===\n{{Quote|Holdan's a spiteful little Hutt-slug. He went and put out a bounty on my head for what I did. That's why I'm hiding out here.|Dia to Revan about her bounty|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:DiaApartment.png|thumb|right|320px|Dia was forced to hide out in her Upper City apartment.]]\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]'' places the events of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]],'' which includes [[Revan/Legends|Revan's]] interactions with Dia, in [[3956 BBY]].</ref> following a [[Attack on the Endar Spire|space battle]] above the planet, several Republic [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]] crashed down onto the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]]. One of these pods contained both the Republic war hero [[Carth Onasi]] and the former Sith Lord Revan; at that [[Time/Legends|time]], Revan was [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] and believed himself to be a [[Republic soldier]]. Revan and Onasi took refuge in the Upper City's South Apartments, attempting to stay out of sight of the Sith, who had imposed a planet-wide quarantine on Taris. Their hideout happened to be next door to Dia's apartment.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nRevan found his way through her locked door and approached Dia. She was surprised and berated him for bursting in. Despite his apologies, she remained upset, though she noted he was more polite than Holdan. Revan asked about Holdan, but Dia hesitated to give much information, as she didn't trust him. However, Revan was able to convince Dia to tell the full story, and she explained her plight to the soldier. Revan offered to help remove the bounty, though Dia doubted he could. She directed him to the Javyar's Cantina, where Holdan enjoyed spending time, and wished Revan luck on talking sense into him. Revan tried to ask Dia more questions about the planet, but she was sheltered from any news and thus was unable to help.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nRevan confronted Holdan in the Javyar's Cantina. Though Holdan was reluctant to remove the bounty,<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> Revan and his party were able to convince him otherwise.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|49|Holdan}}</ref> Holdan went to the [[Zax's bounty office|bounty office]] located within the cantina and called off the bounty with [[Zax]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], an associate of Davik Kang.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nRevan returned to Dia's apartment to tell her of his success. Upon hearing the news, she was overjoyed and thanked him profusely. Knowing she didn't have much, Dia attempted to reward Revan with a family heirloom. However, Revan refused the reward, claiming that helping her was all the thanks he needed. The woman offered a final goodbye and thanks to Revan, and was able to come out of hiding.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|That's no excuse.

Too bad I'm still the one paying the price.|Dia and Revan talking about Holdan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nDia was a light-skinned [[Human/Legends|Human]] female with [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nWhen Dia received a bounty on her head, she thought that the most sensible course was to hide away in her apartment, refusing to risk even leaving the complex. Though this was motivated by fear, when attacked or faced with unavoidable danger, she believed in&mdash;and was capable of&mdash;making a brave stand to prove she was not as defenseless as she seemed. She could be defiant and did not shy away from criticizing the misdeeds of others, such as burglary or harassment.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nDia wore a green tunic with a gray [[Clothing/Legends|undertunic]] and gray pants. She also had brown knee length [[Boot/Legends|boots]], dark brown [[Glove/Legends|gloves]], and a metallic [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]] with several pouches. She wore her hair in a ponytail secured with a brown tie.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nShe carried a vibroblade on her person, which she used against Holdan.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDia appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]]. Player interactions with her are optional, though her dialogue can start the \"Dia's Bounty\" side quest. This quest may be fulfilled in several ways, changing the players alignment accordingly. In order to start the quest, the player must pass a persuasion check or threaten Dia. Alternatively, the player may refuse or avoid the quest entirely.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> The [[2008]] reference book ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' confirms that Revan completed the quest, stating that Revan convinced Holdan to remove the bounty.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n===Gameplay alternatives===\n====Light side options====\n{{Quote|He... he called the bounty off? That's wonderful! I only wish I had something to give you as a reward.|Dia to Revan after hearing about the removal of her bounty|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThere are three ways to convince Holdan to drop the bounty and receive [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points. The player can pay him two hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to cancel the bounty or persuade him to cancel without paying. If [[Bastila Shan]] is in the party during the confrontation, she will use [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuasion]] to have him withdraw the bounty should the player fail to convince Holdan. If the player has Dia's bounty removed, she will offer the player an item. The player can either accept it or either refuse and obtain more light side points.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> ''The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia'' does not specify which of these options was taken.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n====Dark side options====\n{{Quote|Then you're going to learn the same lesson I taught Holdan: I'm not as helpless as I look!|Dia after being threatened by Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn an alternative [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] option, the player can kill Dia to claim the bounty. If Carth Onasi is in the party, he objects to the act, giving the player chance to reconsider the choice. The player may decide to spare her or proceed with the attack. If Dia is killed, the player can collect a three hundred credit bounty from Zax. The player may persuade Zax to raise the reward to four hundred credits.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CSWECite|II|49|Holdan}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dia#legends\n|nl=Dia\n|pl=Dia\n|ru=\u0414\u0438\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
