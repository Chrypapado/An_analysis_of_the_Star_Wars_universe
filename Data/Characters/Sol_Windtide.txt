He was a friend of a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] named [[Nos'lyn]]. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Windtide met with one of Nos'lyn's pupils, a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] individual who aspired to become a Jedi. During the course of their [[Jedi training/Legends|training]], Windtide bestowed to the [[Padawan/Legends|trainee]] a number of gifts, including a [[Training lightsaber/Legends|training lightsaber]] that had once belonged to Nos'lyn.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|You did well.

Nos'lyn took it upon himself to [[Jedi training/Legends|train]] the individual in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. As part of their training, Nos'lyn sent the aspiring Jedi to a [[Tusken village|village]] on Tatooine, the site of a brutal [[Mission to Tatooine (Separatist Crisis)|massacre]] carried out by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] against a tribe of [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. The village was left deserted, except for a number of aggressive [[Species/Legends|creatures]] which roamed the area, twisted by the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Nos'lyn instructed his [[Padawan/Legends|trainee]] to cleanse the area by putting the creatures out of their misery, but not out of hatred. After completing this lesson, Nos'lyn commended his student, and referred them to Sol Windtide to receive a gift in the form of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]].<ref name=\"SWG:AaH\" />\n\nHowever, this would not be the last time Windtide had an encounter with the Force-sensitive. For the next step in their training, Nos'lyn directed his pupil to the [[Crystal Cave (Naboo)|Crystal Cave]] on the planet [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. There, the aspiring Jedi fought off vicious [[Narglatch/Legends|Narglatch]] creatures, and collected an unrefined [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]] to be used in a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. As soon as the crystal was found, Nos'lyn's pupil brought it back to Sol Windtide in Bestine. Windtide commented that the Force-sensitive looked very \"centered.\" He then asked if they found what they were searching for. When the pupil informed Windtide that a suitable crystal had been found, Windtide handed over to the Force-sensitive a [[Training lightsaber/Legends|training lightsaber]] which had once belonged to Nos'lyn. Windtide also took the unrefined crystal and returned to the Force-sensitive a tuned, green [[Color/Legends|colored]] [[lightsaber crystal]]. Windtide told the Force-sensitive that the lightsaber would serve them well, but that they should use discretion when using it.<ref name=\"SWG:SfaJW\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Jedi|Searching for a Jedi's Weapon|Naboo}}</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hello.

Additional [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] included a pair of white long uniform [[Glove/Legends|gloves]], a gray fancy [[Belt/Legends|belt]], and a pair of white high quality [[Boot/Legends|boots]]. Nos'lyn had also sent to Windtide a plasma shield generator and his very first lightsaber, both of which were given to Nos'lyn's pupil as gifts.
