In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Domaz was [[Bombing of Domaz|attacked]] by [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] deployed from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' in retaliation for the population's overthrow of their Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]] following the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] successful [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberation]] of the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]]. In the wake of the bombing, Tren organized the [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] distribution efforts in the city and requested assistance from the crew of the ''[[FarStar]]''&mdash;a New Republic [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] that had answered a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]] from the planet&mdash;in delivering food to neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city.\n\n==Biography==\nTren was a resident of the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Domaz]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kolatill]] in the [[Kathol sector]] during the early [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"O\">{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign}}''</ref> In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], ruler of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], was [[Death/Legends|killed]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]],<ref name=\"ROTJ\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> prompting the local Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Kentor Sarne]], to withdraw the Kathol [[Sector/Legends|sector]] from the Empire. [[8 ABY/Legends|Four years later]], the New Republic launched a campaign against Sarne, [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberating]] the sector [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]] and forcing the [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] to flee into the Kathol sector with the majority of his [[Moff Sarne's forces|fleet]].<ref name=\"TSB\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref> News of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol reached the population of Kolatill shortly after, prompting an uprising that resulted in the imprisonment of their Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Tetrum]], and the reinstatement of the [[Kolatill Council]] to lead them.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nIn response to this turn of events, the Imperial [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' arrived [[Kolatill system|in-system]] and deployed [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] to [[Bombing of Domaz|assault]] Domaz. The attack left the city aflame and in ruins, leveling much of the infrastructure. Tren survived the assault and, in the aftermath, ran the [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] distribution efforts from an emergency relief complex. Four [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the attack, the New Republic [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'' arrived at the planet, having intercepted a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]] about the bombing. [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Keleman Ciro]], [[Commander/Legends|commanding]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]], deployed relief teams to the surface to assist in recovery efforts.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n{{RPGseed}}\nDue to a shortage of available personnel, Tren requested the assistance of ''FarStar'' crew members in delivering food supplies to outlying neighborhoods. During the mission, Tren and the New Republic representatives defused an unexploded [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]], protected the supplies from looters, and prevented a building from exploding due to a severe gas leak. They also managed to dig several survivors of the attack out of the rubble of a demolished building.<ref name=\"O\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTren was an effective leader and organizer, running the food distribution efforts in the wake of the bombing of Domaz. A practical individual, Tren realized that any undermanned mission to deliver food supplies to the outskirts of the city would be in danger unless the aid of the crew of the ''FarStar'' was enlisted.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTren's only appearance was in the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[Omens]]'', which was written by [[Bill Smith]] and included as one of the scenarios in ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' published by [[West End Games]] in [[1995]]. The gamemaster was not obliged to use Tren in their game, but the character could be used as an adventure hook for a minor mission to distribute food to outlying areas of the city.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{1st}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kolatill residents]]"}}}]}}}}
