He was cold, calculating, and arrogant, and was feared by opponents of the Exchange. Skillful with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], his own henchmen included [[Matu]] and [[Nahata]], two of the best and most ruthless Exchange thugs on Telos. Benok, while on Telos, threatened [[Meetra Surik]] in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] only to be killed by her later as she [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|stormed]] the Exchange offices. Wearing [[reinforced fiber armor]] for protection, Benok also had a [[Benok's blaster|custom blaster]] with an additional ion cell, which Surik may have taken from Benok's body as a trophy after he was killed.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Benok\n|es=Benok\n|fr=Benok\n}}\n\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
