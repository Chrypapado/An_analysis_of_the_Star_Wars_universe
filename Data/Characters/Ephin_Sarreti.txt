He was young at the time of the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], while he came of age in the midst of the the [[Rebellion era|Rebellion]]. Following the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|fall of Coruscant]] to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], his family fled offworld, eventually arriving on [[Bastion/Legends|Sartinaynian]]. After settling on the planet, he entered Imperial service.<ref name=\"DT2\" />\n\nFollowing the arrest of Moff [[Vilim Disra]] in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]] for his complicity in the [[Caamas Document Crisis|Caamas Document affair]], the [[Council of Moffs]] appointed Sarreti to take his place as Moff of the Braxant Sector, which included the Remnant's capital world, Bastion.<ref name=\"DT2\" />\n\nSarreti served as Moff throughout the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. He supported [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon's]] plan to aid the New Republic in the conflict, arguing that it was the right thing to do. He also offered to accompany Pellaeon in a military capacity, but Pellaeon declined, as the Grand Admiral felt he needed an ally in [[Imperial Space]] to keep the other Moffs loyal.<ref name=\"DT2\" />\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of Ithor]], he traveled with several other Moffs to [[Ithor/Legends|the planet]] for a diplomatic reception with their New Republic counterparts. His enthusiasm and knowledge about the lives of [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Borsk Fey'lya]] and [[New Republic Advisory Council|his advisors]] raised their suspicions.<ref name=\"DT2\" />\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Bastion]], from which he escaped with a broken arm, Sarreti supported Pellaeon's stance that the Remnant align with the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] and conduct an offensive campaign against the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"FHI\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''</ref>\n\nBy [[40 ABY]], Sarreti was one of the few Moffs that Pellaeon still trusted as of the [[Second Battle of Fondor]].<ref name=\"LFR\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nDecades later, the [[Fel Empire]] honored Sarreti by naming a [[Ephin Sarreti (Star Destroyer)|Star Destroyer]] after him.<ref name=\"LECG\">''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSarreti's relative youth and experiences meant that he never met [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], and was not as enmeshed in Palpatine's prejudices. As he had joined Imperial service during its decline, he did not view the recent past through the lenses of melancholy and fury that his elders amongst the Moffs, such as [[Kurlen Flennic]], often did. This detachment allowed him to advocate moves that drew opposition from other Imperials, such as allying with the Galactic Alliance. Even so, he was not a fan of democracy.\n\nSarreti was completely loyal to Pellaeon; after the meeting where Pellaeon announced the mobilization of all reserve forces, he asked to accompany the Grand Admiral in a military capacity. Pellaeon trusted Sarreti to keep the peace in Imperial Space while the Grand Admiral was away on campaign and considered the young man a builder.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n\n{{Moffs25ABY}}\n\n{{Moffs41ABYRevelation}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ephin Sarreti\n|es=Ephin Sarreti\n|fr=Ephin Sarreti\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarreti, Ephin}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moff Council members]]\n[[Category:Moffs of the Imperial Remnant]]"}}}]}}}}
