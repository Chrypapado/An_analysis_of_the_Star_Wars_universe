She developed a friendship with their son [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge]], who nicknamed her \"Myra\" and whom she nicknamed \"Veggies\". When her father was finally apprehended by [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] and sentenced to five years of hard labor on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], the still underage Mirax took control of his smuggling operation. Under her guidance, the organization maintained its profitability despite turning almost completely legitimate. Wedge occasionally performed maintenance on her ship before he defected full time to the Rebellion.\n\nSeveral years later, Mirax turned to smuggling herself, operating her father's ship, ''[[Pulsar Skate]]''. Mirax encountered [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] a number of times, including on [[Mrlsst/Legends|Mrlsst]], where she aided the Rogues in bargaining for the [[Phantom Project]]. When the negotiations went sour, she escaped along with some of the other Rogues on [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson's]] repulsorlift hoversled. Eventually, she and some of the others made their way to a base in the asteroid where the project was being held, only to discover it was a fake. The asteroid exploded, but Mirax and the Rogues escaped in the ''Skate.''<ref name=\"X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair]]''</ref> She would later help Wedge again in his attempt to extract [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]] from [[Ciutric IV]], bringing the ''Skate'' and a load of [[R2-series astromech droid|R2 units]] in the ''Skate'' and serving as a decoy to allow the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] strike team to escape from the planet.<ref name=\"X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], she came under attack by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] ship, [[Corusca Rainbow|''Black Asp'']], but was rescued by [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. In addition to her friend Wedge Antilles, the squadron also included [[Corran Horn]]&mdash;whose father [[Hal Horn]] had been responsible for arresting Mirax's father [[Booster Terrik]]. Needless to say, Mirax didn't enjoy being in debt to him, but her friendship with Wedge convinced her to aid the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n===Aiding the New Republic===\n{{Quote|If you don't see a body, don't count on someone being dead.|Mirax Terrik|X-Wing: The Bacta War}}\n[[File:SoF_Chpt_IV_Modular_Encounters.png|thumb|right|250px|thumb|Mirax checks the delivery of goods]]\nMirax's smuggling was essential in supplying [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] to the newly-liberated [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], which was suffering from the [[Krytos virus]]. In this time, she was partnered with Horn, whom she eventually forgave and befriended. By the time of the [[Bacta War]] they had fallen in love, and just before the [[Battle of Thyferra|final battle of that conflict]], she agreed when he asked to marry her. Shortly after the battle, they were married onboard the captured [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' by Wedge Antilles in his authority as acting ship's [[Captain/Legends|captain]]. Shortly thereafter, a larger and more official ceremony was held on Coruscant.\n\nFollowing their wedding, Mirax began a shipping business, although she returned to smuggling during the [[Thrawn campaign]] to supply resistance cells and smuggle refugees on [[Planet/Legends|planets]] conquered by [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]].\n\n[[11 ABY/Legends|Two years]] after Thrawn's death, she attempted to apprehend the rogue [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Leonia Tavira]], but was instead captured by her [[Invids|Invid]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]]. She was imprisoned on the planet [[Suarbi (star)|Suarbi]], until her husband and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] could [[Battle of Susevfi|free]] her. In [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]], she gave birth to a son, Valin, and later had a daughter, Jysella. By [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], she attended the [[Wedding of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade|wedding]] of Skywalker and [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]]; subsequently Mara and Mirax, both ex-smugglers, became good friends, and when Luke's duties kept him at the [[Jedi Praxeum]] for long periods, Mara crewed aboard the ''Pulsar Skate'' with her. On one trip, at some point prior to [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], they were charged with causing criminal damage after a run-in with rivals or enemies, though the exact circumstances are unknown, and both women were ultimately exonerated.\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War===\n[[File:Boostermirax.jpg|thumb|left|Booster and Mirax attending Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade's wedding.]]\n\nBeing married to a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], Mirax soon took an interest in the [[New Jedi Order]]. She often monitored requests for courier runs, and gave special priority to [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] requests. This led her to transport Luke and Mara Skywalker, [[Anakin Solo]], and [[Chalco]] to [[Vortex/Legends|Vortex]], in pursuit of the rogue [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] Jedi [[Daeshara'cor]]. Later, during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Mirax was with Corran several times at [[Eclipse (planet)|Eclipse]]&mdash;including during the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Battle of Eclipse|assault]] on the [[Eclipse Station]] Jedi base. Later the two were attacked by [[voxyn]] while hiding on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War===\nIn [[40 ABY]], due to her husband's status as a Jedi, she was placed under house arrest by [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]]'s government. Following the death of Sal-Solo, the house arrest was lifted. Mirax and Corran later aided the Solos and Wedge on Corellia after the three severed their ties with the [[Five Worlds]]. They took refuge on the ''[[Errant Venture]]'', where Mirax finally acceded to years of her father's demands to learn the operations of the mobile smuggler's den - chiefly as she had very little else to do.\n\n===Personal tragedy===\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], two years after the end of the Second Galactic Civil War, Mirax and her family suffered a very personal tragedy. With the beginning of the Open Alliance Talks, Mirax's entire family was on Coruscant, a rare occasion, and she had arranged for the family to stay together during the conference. While making breakfast one morning, Mirax was horrified when she was attacked by her son [[Valin Horn|Valin]]. Mirax escaped injury due to the arrival of Corran but was forced to shoot her deranged son with a stun bolt to prevent him from killing what he perceived as a false Corran. She later learned that Valin was afflicted with a [[Force psychosis|mysterious ailment]] that caused him to see everyone around him as impostors, even his parents. Mirax could do nothing as Valin eventually became a fugitive and was later captured and imprisoned in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]. She would later assist members of [[Darkmeld]] during the [[Raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility]].\n\nThe Horns were struck once again, as their daughter, Jysella succumbed to the disease and was frozen in carbonite also. She would later accompany a group of Jedi Masters and Jaina Solo to the [[Galactic Justice Center]], to execute a court-approved warrant to see her children. They found both their children suspended in carbonite above an aquarium, as a common decoration in the Center's barracks. Horrified and enraged at seeing her beloved children in this state, she angrily confronted the warden responsible before punching him right in the face, knocking him out.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhile the ''Rogue Squadron'' comics and ''Union'' have her eyes being blue, ''I, Jedi'' states them as being brown, with them being referred to as blue again in ''Legacy of the Force: Exile''.\n\nMirax's friend Wedge Antilles named his youngest daughter, [[Myri Antilles]] after her. Myri's name derived from Mirax's childhood nickname Myra.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n[[File:Miraxterrik.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mirax Terrik]]\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|scenario=Booster Shot promotional scenario}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[I, Jedi]]''\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]''\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Omen'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Abyss'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Allies'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Vortex'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'' audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill (audiobook)|''X-Wing: Mercy Kill'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CollectorCite|8|ComicScan|ComicScan: 'Til Death Do They Part}}\n*{{CCG|set=Reflections II: Expanding the Galaxy|cardname=Mirax Terrik}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*{{FFCite|126|TER3-4, ''Mirax Terrik''}}\n*[[Scum and Villainy (sourcebook)|''Scum and Villainy'']]\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadow_Syndicate#Card_gallery|cardname=Mirax Terrik}}\n*{{DB|character|elegosakla|A'Kla, Elegos|archivedate=20100330032545}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Suns of Fortune]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Mirax Terrik Horn}}\n*[[Horn family]]\n*[[Terrik family]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mirax Terrik Horn\n|es=Mirax Terrik Horn\n|fi=Mirax Terrik Horn\n|ka=\u10db\u10d8\u10e0\u10d0\u10e5\u10e1 \u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10d9 \u10f0\u10dd\u10e0\u10dc\u10d8\n|nl=Mirax Terrik Horn\n|pl=Mirax Terrik\n|ru=\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u043a-\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Mirax Terrik}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Antilles's Rogues]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Darkmeld]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Coalition personnel]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Terrik organization personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
