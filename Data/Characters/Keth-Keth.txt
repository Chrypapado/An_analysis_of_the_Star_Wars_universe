After a failed attempt at infiltrating the facility, Keth-Keth suggested that they smash a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] into the building, but the team rejected his proposal, believing it to be irrational and illegal. However, Roorrwiir accidentally crashed the team's speeder into the building, and Keth-Keth and the others quickly made their way through the building and rescued their friend. However, while they were attempting to leave, an [[Office of Peace and Security]] speeder arrived, and Keth-Keth threw a [[Stun grenade/Legends|stun grenade]] at it. Believing that they needed someone to blame the incident on, Keth-Keth used [[spray-namel]] to write the words \"W.O.L.F.\" on the OPS speeder, and he ran around shouting the phrases \"Free [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]\" and \"[[Wookiee Liberation Front]]\". The incident gained the supposed \"Wookiee Liberation Front\" a lot of publicity and it eventually developed into a real organization, assisting the Wookiees of Kashyyyk.\n\nAt some point after the incident, Keth-Keth and Meelo were stopped by some [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] in the city [[Hedrett]], for an I.D. check. One of the troopers started harassing Keth-Keth and suggested that the Jawa should go back to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], so Keth-Keth pulled out a [[stun glove]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMeelo considered Keth-Keth to be the most annoying Jawa on Cularin. Keth-Keth wore a [[Blast helmet/Legends|blast helmet]] with a [[Vocabulator/Legends|vocabulator]] attached, which translated his speech into [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051215Meelov2|text=Life According to Meelo|int=Life According to Meelo|archivedate=20051230095842}} {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Jawas]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
