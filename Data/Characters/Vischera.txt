Originally working for the Empire as a [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]], Vischera transferred to the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]] and became the commander of a secret [[Vanishing Place|Imperial prison]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]]. After learning about a series of experiments previously carried out by the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]] to turn a group of [[Nelvaanian/Legends|Nelvaanians]] into violent warriors, Vischera attempted to duplicate the procedure on captured [[Jungle Felucian/Legends|Felucians]]. He carried out alterations on the Felucian genetic code and, after months of research, succeeded in creating two fully obedient Felucians, whom he made his personal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]].\n\nWhen former Imperial [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gilder Varth]] was discovered to be in contact with the anti-Imperial [[Alderaanian Resistance]], he was [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] in Vischera's [[Prison/Legends|facility]]. The Resistance [[Mission to Felucia (Imperial Period)|sent]] a group of agents to Felucia to free Varth, and following their infiltration of the prison, Vischera confronted them in the building's command center but was eventually defeated by them.\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Vischera lived during the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] following the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and worked as a [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] for the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. He eventually transferred to the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]], where he attained the rank of [[Captain/Legends|captain]] and was made the commander of an [[Vanishing Place|Imperial prison]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]]. However, he did not give up his scholarly past and studied various scientific secrets that the Empire had obtained. The Empire had acquired the details of a series of experiments that were carried out during the Clone Wars by the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]] on the planet [[Nelvaan/Legends|Nelvaan]] to turn a group of [[Nelvaanian/Legends|Nelvaanians]] into large, violent warriors who served their creators' will. Intrigued, Vischera planned to carry out a similar experiment on captured [[Jungle Felucian/Legends|Felucians]].<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\nAfter converting the [[Prison/Legends|prison's]] medical bay into a science lab and hiring some medical researchers to assist him, Vischera began experimenting with the Felucian genetic code. He directly altered the [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] of a number of Felucians, using healing stimulants to stabilize the changes he made. With two of his earlier test subjects, Vischera removed their right forearms and caused their upper arms to mutate, allowing him to turn their arms into sharp blades. He also gave them some chitinous scales from a [[Species/Legends|species]] of [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] and made them stronger and more aggressive. Vischera continued to perfect his alterations on the Felucians and kept subjects from various stages in the evolution alive for further observation. Following months of research, Vischera finally succeeded in creating two fully obedient Felucians. He named them [[Hagark]] and [[Kargrek]] and, after overseeing their combat training, made them his personal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]]. At some point, Vischera also created a new type of [[virus]], which could be contracted by Felucian children, causing their muscles to thin until they ultimately became paralyzed.<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\nAfter Imperial [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gilder Varth]] was found to be contacting the [[Alderaanian Resistance]], an anti-Imperial rebel organization, he was detained by the Empire and [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] in Vischera's facility. A group of Resistance agents were [[Mission to Felucia (Imperial Period)|dispatched]] to rescue Varth, and they infiltrated the Felucian prison and freed the admiral. However, Vischera was alerted to their presence, and he waited in the facility's command center to confront them, as the agents would have to pass through there if they were to escape from the prison. He stood with his Felucian bodyguards and four [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], and when the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] agents finally entered the room, he immediately ordered Hagark and Kargrek to protect him. He then told the stormtroopers to attack the agents and assisted the [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] by firing his [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] at any agents who were proving difficult to take down. However, despite his efforts, Vischera was incapacitated, and the other Imperials were defeated, allowing Varth and the Alderaanian agents to escape from the prison.<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nVischera was slender, with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, giving him a malnourished appearance. He also had spiky hair, which was starting to gray by the time he served as commander of the Felucian prison. Although he was a very intelligent man, he was cruel and sadistic, making him very dangerous and well-suited for Imperial service. He became obsessed with the experiments he carried out on the Felucians to such an extent that they made him partially insane and he was prepared to defend his facility to the [[Death/Legends|death]].<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\nVischera was multilingual; in addition to [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], he could also speak [[Bocce/Legends|Bocce]], [[Durese/Legends|Durese]], and [[High Galactic/Legends|High Galactic]].<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVischera was created by author [[Rodney Thompson]] for ''[[The Traitor's Gambit]]'', the first scenario in the ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' campaign, a [[Wizards of the Coast]] online supplement to the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]''. In the supplement, the players [[Roleplaying game|roleplay]] as the team of Alderaanian Resistance agents, and it is possible for them to kill Vischera during their encounter with him.<ref name=\"gambit\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Traitor's Gambit|int=The Traitor's Gambit|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vischera\n}}\n\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Felucia residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
