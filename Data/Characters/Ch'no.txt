A scrounger and collector of junk, he adopted an infant [[Human/Legends|Human]] named [[Mora]] after finding her in the rubble of her ruined home after her family was [[Death/Legends|killed]]. As a [[H'Drachi Seers|seer]], Ch'no knew that the young girl would later be revealed as the sole living heir to the ruling house of [[M'haeli/Legends|M'haeli]], but he kept that secret for a long time. Other H'drachi did not enjoy the presence of Humans on M'haeli, seeing them as a scourge to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Ch'no and Mora had the ability to disrupt the [[time-stream]]s on M'haeli, making travel among other H'drachi without detection nearly impossible.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: River of Chaos]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[File:Chno-TEGtPaM.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ch'no\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:H'drachi]]\n[[Category:M'haeli residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
