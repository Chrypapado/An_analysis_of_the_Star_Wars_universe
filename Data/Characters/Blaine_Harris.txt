Bakura's defenses were essentially nonexistent before the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] occupation. During the Imperial occupation, the Empire had total control of its garrison, and Bakuran security forces were restricted to the police. After the Imperial occupation, no real military was re-established until the [[Bakuran Defense Fleet]], after Yeorg Captison left office. Captison's successor, his niece [[Gaeriel Captison|Gaeriel]], kept Harris in his position, as did the Prime Minister that replaced her. He became [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under [[Molierre Cundertol]], where he plotted to assassinate him and the planetary senators, sever all ties to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and rule as a dictator. Holding great disdain for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], he funded the [[Freedom resistance movement]] in hopes of joining with the [[P'w'eck Emancipation Movement]]. Hoping to sequester Freedom's leader, [[Malinza Thanas]], he had [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] kidnapped in order to frame Thanas. Plotting to kill the Jedi, Thanas, Cundertol and the entire Senate, his plot was discovered and he was shot in the head and killed by Cundertol.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Blaine Harris\n|es=Blaine Harris\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harris, Blaine}}\n[[Category:Bakurans]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
