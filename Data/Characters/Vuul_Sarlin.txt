Ask Jaylon how to find Vuul.|[[Menchi Lerann]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Vuul Sarlin was leading a group of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] dealers in the city of [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]]. [[Jaylon Geissler]] served as his right-hand. The group owned a [[Ryll Warehouse|warehouse]] in Kor Vella to stock the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] spice distributed in the city. The spice was provided by a gang of ryll [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]]. For security reasons, Vuul Sarlin and his men ignored everything about this ryll smuggling ring, that was in fact the [[Chirq Council]], best known as the Red Circle Gang. They had only one contact among the ryll smugglers, [[Ladonna Poe]], who provided the ryll from a [[Ryll Smuggler Base|bunker]] in the [[Vella plains]] nearby.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Corellian Security Force]] started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]] questioned a local spice addict known as [[Menchi Lerann]]. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin and Jaylon Geissler. The spacer later interrogated Geissler but the spice dealer obviously refused to collaborate. However, after the spacer started to destroy some spice crates in the ryll warehouse, Jaylon Geissler reluctantly accepted to give Vuul Sarlin's current location: a small camp in the plains outside Kor Vella. The spacer therefore attacked the camp and defeated Vuul Sarlin's guards. Sarlin was forced to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> In return, the spacer agreed with removing Sarlin's name from the smuggling ring's database.<ref name=\"SWG:DP\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Database Purge|Corellia}}</ref> The CorSec later assaulted the Ryll Smuggler Bunker and discovered the existence of the Red Circle Gang.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{PAGENAME}} appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ryll_Smuggling_Ring_(card).JPG|cardname=Ryll Smuggling Ring}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Vuul Sarlin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarlin, Vuul}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spice dealers]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
