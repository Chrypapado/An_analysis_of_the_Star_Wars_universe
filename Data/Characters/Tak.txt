However, even as a slave, Tak swindled his way to try and get easier work shifts.<ref name=\"Solo Official Guide\" />\n\nIn [[10 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date Note\">The timeline provided in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]'' places [[Han Solo]]{{'s}} [[Kessel Run]] nine [[Standard year|years]] after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. As that film takes place in [[19 BBY]], we can deduce that the mission to [[Kessel]] and the subsequent Kessel Run took place in [[10 BBY]].</ref> Tak was present working at the mines when the [[Crimson Dawn]] henchman [[Tobias Beckett]] and [[Beckett's gang|his gang]] [[Raid on Kessel|came]] to talk with the [[Pyke]] [[capo]] [[Quay Tolsite]], who supervised the mine. However, the deal was in reality an assault organized by [[Dryden Vos]], Crimson Dawn's leader. After [[Qi'ra]] [[Death|killed]] Tolsite by using [[Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si]], Tak and the other [[miner]]s were freed from imprisonment and escaped to the surface for freedom.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWith the absence of [[C-3PO]], Tak was played by ''[[Star Wars]]'' veteran [[Anthony Daniels]] in the [[2018]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''. Tak's role follows the tradition in having Daniels appearing in every film of the franchise and references C-3PO's concern of \"being sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what\" from the first scene in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*{{DisneyPlusYT|dAmy0CzKwB0|10 Surprising Star Wars Cameos You Didn't Even Notice &#124; Disney+|archivedate=20210824202802}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Tak\n|fr=Tak\n|ja=\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\uff08\u72af\u7f6a\u8005\uff09\n|ka=\u10e2\u10d0\u10d9\u10d8 (\u10d7\u10d0\u10e6\u10da\u10d8\u10d7\u10d8)\n|pl=Tak\n|ru=\u0422\u0430\u043a (\u043c\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pyke Syndicate slaves]]"}}}]}}}}
