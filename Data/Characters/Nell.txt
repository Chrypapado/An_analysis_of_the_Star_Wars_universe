During his career, Nell became indebted to [[Giarda]] of the [[Jiramma]] [[Kajidic/Legends|kajidic]]. While on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Nell partnered with the [[Gank/Legends|Gank]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Gorran]] on a job to recover a [[Sakiyan]] informant and pay off his debts to Giarda, by collecting a bounty placed by the [[Gorensla/Legends|Gorensla]] clan. When both Gorran and Nell were stopped in the streets by Giarda and her guards, the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] manipulated the pair into working for her, allowing Gorran and Nell to proposed turning over [[Razall]] over to her in exchange for a clean slate for their debt. When the pair successfully captured Razall, Giarda followed through on her promise of forgiving their debts, privately gloating on her accomplishment of twisting them back into her service.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Lords of Nal Hutta]]''\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
