Even though there is nothing to fear&hellip;|Councilman Derral to his friend, shortly before both were assassinated.|Rebellion 6}}\n'''This man''' was a [[council]]man on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ahakista/Legends|Ahakista]] and a friend of Councilman [[Derral]].\n\n==Biography==\nDerral's friend was not particularly given toward the idea of touring the poorer parts of the city since he felt that the things for sale there were not of the highest quality. Chief among his objections to Derral's tour was the fact that Ahakista's [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]]-backed [[Ahakistan Council|government]] was not popular with the lower classes. The planet's poorer citizens had recently expressed their displeasure toward the government through protests and [[Ahakistan Civil War|more violent means]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 6 The Ahakista Gambit Part 1 13\">[[Rebellion 6|''Rebellion'' 6]], page 13.</ref>\n\nWhen Derral complained about the quality of the wares that the street vendors were selling, his friend took the opportunity to remind him of his objections to the trip. As Derral tried to reassure him that his worries were unfounded, they encountered a young beggar who asked Derral for a token of his goodwill. Derral did so, but not in the way that the child had expected.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 6 The Ahakista Gambit Part 1 13\" />\n\nThe two councilmen walked back to a waiting [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] and Derral's friend fell a distance behind him. As Derral was getting inside, his friend called for him to wait. Both of them were killed by [[Dunlan]]. The assassination of the two councilmen led to the Empire to take a more direct role in the affairs of Ahakista's government and consequently an escalation of the civil war.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 6 The Ahakista Gambit Part 1 13\" /><ref>[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]], page 6.</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Rebellion 6|''Rebellion'' 6]] {{1st}}\n*[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ahakistans]]\n[[Category:Imperials]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified political figures]]"}}}]}}}}
