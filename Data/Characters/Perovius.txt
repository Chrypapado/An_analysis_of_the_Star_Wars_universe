When Peyar condemned his wife [[Chay Cortess]] for treachery, he ordered Perovius to [[Death/Legends|kill]] her.\n\nSoon after, [[Cipher Nine]] and [[Vector Hyllus]] broke into Peyar's throne room. Peyar begged for the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Imperial]] agents to spare his House from the [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]]. However, Cipher Nine killed Peyar and then killed Perovius before allowing the Killiks to attack.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe player can choose to oppose the Killiks and defend House Cortess for light side points, or let the Killiks claim the House Cortess estate for themselves for dark side points. If the player chooses the light side option, Perovius and the members of House Cortess will survive the Killik invasion.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Articles with gameplay alternatives]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:House Cortess]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
