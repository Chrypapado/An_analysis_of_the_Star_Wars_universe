She was known as a vicious warrior, and came to be the [[den mother]] of Selonians who lived inside the [[Selonian Tunnels|Selonian Tunnel Network]] under Corellia's [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] [[Battle of Corellia|invaded]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], [[den mother]] Murthil, along with her [[Murthil's den|den's]] many Selonians, aided the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] rebels in their battle against the Imperials. After the Empire bombed several factories in the [[Labor Valley]], Murthil led a group of rebel Selonians when the Empire placed a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on them in an effort to cull the aliens' numbers. Afterwards, the Selonians traveled to a tunnel network underneath [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] where they faced an Imperial hero who had followed them. Murthil and her troops including [[Destha]] battled the Imperials, but were all defeated. By the time [[General/Legends|General]] [[Hesker]] and his men entered the scene, Murthil was the only one left alive and pleading to spare her in exchange for joining the Empire.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Domesticate the Selonians or kill them, may the dark side guide you.|Darth Decimus, to the player|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nMurthil is a character in the 2011 ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' video game.
