In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], her son [[Rroot]] was captured by a group of [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]] known as the [[Blackscale Clan/Legends|Blackscale Clan]]. She hired a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to travel to their camp in the [[Rryatt Trail]] and rescue him.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKymayrr is one of the many residents of Kashyyyk added to ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' through its [[2005]] expansion pack ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees]]''.\n\nKymayrr was originally a [[Entertainer|dancer]] in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on one of the levels of the great [[Wroshyr tree/Legends|wroshyr tree]] in Kachirho, and her name reflected such in brackets (as \"A Wookiee Dancer\"). Unfortunately, she would constantly fall through the floor of the cantina, winding up on the ground level of Kachirho, inaccessible to players. Instead of constant game master intervention or server resets to place her back in the cantina, the developers simply moved her down to ground level and removed any mention of her being a dancer at the cantina.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
