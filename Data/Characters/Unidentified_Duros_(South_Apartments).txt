At one point, Ixgil's friend was arrested by the Sith, and held in the local [[Tarisian military base|Sith base]]. [[Gender/Legends|He]] was eventually freed by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter the [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] carrying [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]] landed on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], the duo sought refuge in an abandoned [[South Apartments|apartment]] located in the same building in which the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Ixgil]] and his friend of the same [[Species/Legends|species]] lived. After two consecutive [[Standard day/Legends|days]] of harassment from [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] patrols, Ixgil lost patience, and stood up to one of the patrols, only to be shot and [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a [[Unidentified Sith soldier|Sith enforcer]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThe patrol then engaged in combat with Onasi and Revan, with the same [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Soldier/Legends|enforcer]] claiming them to be \"Republic Fugitives,\" Ixgil's friend assisted Onasi and Revan in the fight, helping them kill the Sith soldier and his [[Droid/Legends|droid]] associates. After the battle, the Duros then thanked Onasi and Revan for the assistance, before removing Ixgil's body, along with the Sith bodies, to protect Revan.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nHowever, he was caught by the Sith in doing this and was [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] in their [[Tarisian military base|military base]], where Revan later found and freed him, as he and his companions went in search for the Taris Launch Codes. The late Ixgil's friend was unsure why Revan was in the base, but advised Revan that he followed him in escaping from the base.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen fighting the Sith patrol in the apartment, the Duros cannot be killed by the enemy, but can still be attacked, possibly resulting him to clutch his side after the brawl if he is under fire for too long. The Duros may also draw out a [[Sword/Legends|sword]] during the fight, though he may also attempt to fight the Sith patrol without a weapon.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nThe player gets [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points for freeing the Duros from the cell in the military base. However, the player, depending on their actions, can also gain [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points regarding events with this Duros.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nWhen the player reaches this Duros in the Sith base, a small puzzle involving turning a number of panels to the off position must be solved in order to release the Duros. However, Revan can set all the panels to \"terminate,\" and the Duros will be killed, earning the player dark side points.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nAlso, when the player first talks to the Duros, after defeating the Sith patrol in the apartment, the Duros thanks him for helping out, but whilst two of the three dialogue options to follow do not shift the player's alignment at all, the player could gain dark side points by threating to be brutal to the Duros, in which case the fearful Duros tries to explain himself for his words, even though nothing offensive was said. Even if the player does choose to snap, the Duros can't be brought into a fight.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ixgils Freund\n|pl=Przyjaciel Ixgila\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0441 (\u042e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
