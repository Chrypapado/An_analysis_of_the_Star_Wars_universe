Sergeant Cormun, Fifth Infantry company, Korriban regiment. Can I&mdash;can I talk to you?|Sergeant Cormun, speaking to a Sith acolyte|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Cormun''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]] as a [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]] in the [[Imperial Army (Sith Empire)|Imperial Army]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], a period of unrest between the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Empire and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Around the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3643 BBY]], he was part of the [[Korriban regiment]]'s [[Fifth Infantry company]] and was stationed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Korriban]] near the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] on that world. During his [[Time/Legends|time]] there, Cormun acquired substantial knowledge about the recent events at the Sith Academy. He treated Sith respectfully, and viewed those who could [[Force-sensitive/Legends|use]] [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] as much more powerful than normal individuals. Despite his respect for the Sith, the sergeant would not allow his [[Troop/Legends|troops]]' abilities to be questioned without protest.\n\nWhile he was stationed on Korriban, Cormun was [[Mission to Ajunta Pall's tomb (k'lor'slug extermination)|tasked]] with [[Death/Legends|eliminating]] [[K'lor'slug/Legends|k'lor'slugs]] in the [[Tomb of Ajunta Pall|tomb]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Ajunta Pall]]. During the mission, Cormun made the decision to target the k'lor'slug [[Egg/Legends|egg]] chambers with explosives in order to negate the large [[Worm/Legends|worm]]-like creatures' fast rate of [[Reproduction/Legends|reproduction]], which had foiled previous attempts at extermination. However, when his troops placed the explosives, a large number of k'lor'slugs attacked his team wildly and killed three entire [[Squad/Legends|squads]] of his [[Imperial soldier|troopers]]. After losing these troops, which comprised most of his team, Cormun retreated and took up position at one of the [[Burial/Legends|tomb]] entrances with his remaining forces. The sergeant realized that he needed someone skilled in using the Force to help him with the tomb's k'lor'slug infestation. He eventually enlisted the aid of a [[Sith Acolyte]] from the Academy, who went to the k'lor'slug egg chambers and successfully detonated the explosives.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I'm here commanding a hard target mission to exterminate k'lor'slug's in this tomb. They're&hellip; horrific things. Mouths bigger than your head.|Sergeant Cormun, explaining his mission to a Sith acolyte|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Cormun-TOR.png|thumb|left|155px|Sergeant Cormun in Ajunta Pall's tomb]]\nCormun was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was alive during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], a period of unrest between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]].<ref name=\"TOR\" /> Around the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"TORdate\">{{TOR_dates|1}}</ref> Cormun was serving in the [[Imperial Army (Sith Empire)|Imperial Army]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Empire as a [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]] in the [[Korriban regiment]]'s [[Fifth Infantry company]]. During that [[Time/Legends|time]], he was on [[Korriban]] near the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] located on that [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. He was [[Mission to Ajunta Pall's tomb (k'lor'slug extermination)|assigned]] the task of [[Death/Legends|exterminating]] an infestation of [[K'lor'slug/Legends|k'lor'slugs]] in the [[Tomb of Ajunta Pall|tomb]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Ajunta Pall]]. The k'lor'slugs, a [[Species/Legends|species]] of large [[Worm/Legends|worm]]-like creatures, had survived initial attempts at extermination due to their high rate of [[Reproduction/Legends|reproduction]]. Seeing that previous attempts had failed, Cormun decided to destroy the creatures' [[Egg/Legends|egg]] chambers using explosives. However, when he and his [[Troop/Legends|troops]] entered the egg chambers and attempted to destroy them, the k'lor'slugs attacked them in a crazed frenzy.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nAlthough Cormun's troops were outnumbered, they were able to place the explosives despite losing three entire [[Squad/Legends|squads]] of experienced troops, which comprised the majority of Sergeant Cormun's forces. However, Cormun and his remaining forces were unable to detonate the explosives before they were forced to retreat from the k'lor'slug egg chambers and take up a defensive position at one of the entrances to the [[Burial/Legends|tomb]]. Cormun realized that his men would be unable to complete the mission and that he would need the help of a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-user]] to destroy the k'lor'slugs' egg chambers. Without enough troops left to enter the tomb and detonate the explosives they had planted, Cormun and his remaining men guarded the entrance, along with a [[Sith Warrior]] named [[Veshta]], and a [[Sith Inquisitor]] named [[Gesen]], who was examining dead k'lor'slugs. By that time, only two of Cormun's [[Imperial soldier|troopers]] remained alive in the tomb, with one able to stand guard and the other unable to fight due to his wounds.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nEventually, a [[Sith Acolyte]] from the Sith Academy arrived in the tomb and spoke with Cormun, who asked for assistance in destroying the k'lor'slugs. He told the acolyte that if the explosives were successful in destroying the egg chambers, the k'lor'slugs could then be eradicated. The acolyte accepted the assignment and successfully destroyed the egg chambers using the explosives, which Cormun heard from his position at the entrance. Upon the acolyte's return, Cormun praised the individual for the successful completion of the task and stayed at the entrance to defend the position, waiting to be reassigned. While he stayed at the entrance, he warned non-Sith away from the tomb, informing them that the Sith did not appreciate visitors.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I've lost three squads of good men fighting them. They come in packs&mdash;they just&hellip; they'll swallow a man whole.|Sergeant Cormun, speaking of the k'lor'slugs in Ajunta Pall's tomb|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nAlthough Sergeant Cormun was in command of three entire squads of [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]], during his mission to destroy k'lor'slugs in Ajunta Pall's tomb he was unable to keep his troops from being killed. After most of his troops were eliminated, Cormun realized that he would need someone more skilled to destroy the creatures. However, he still viewed his [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] as highly skilled, and believed that their defeat was due to them being outnumbered by the k'lor'slugs. After his encounters with the k'lor'slugs, Cormun viewed them as horrific and deadly, with more intelligence than he originally thought they possessed. He also had a fair amount of knowledge about events and new arrivals at the academy. He had fair skin, [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and blue-gray [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nWhen he met the Sith Acolyte, Cormun knew who the acolyte was and how the individual had arrived at the academy. When speaking to the acolyte, Cormun was respectful and asked the acolyte for permission to make his request for aid. He presented the mission to the acolyte as a way to impress the academy overseers, as well as form connections with the Imperial military. Cormun viewed the acolyte's [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-sensitivity as a major advantage, to the point of the acolyte being worth a dozen normal individuals. Although he was polite to the Sith Acolyte, Cormun insisted that he could not complete the mission without the aid of someone who could use the Force. Learning from his own mistakes, Cormun warned the acolyte against underestimating the k'lor'slugs as he had done during his attempts to exterminate them. During his assignment to destroy the k'lor'slugs, Cormun was able to come up with a solution to destroy the k'lor'slugs using explosives, which was successful, although his troops were unable to implement it.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|We managed to get explosives to all of the egg chambers, but the k'lor'slugs were all over us before we could detonate them.|Sergeant Cormun, telling a Sith acolyte about his plan to exterminate the k'lor'slugs|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nDuring his time in Ajunta Pall's tomb, Cormun wore a suit of red and gray [[Sith trooper armor/Legends|armor]] of the same type that was worn by Imperial troopers on Korriban at the time. He used a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]] and possessed the explosives necessary to destroy the nests of the k'lor'slugs.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|My superior, Captain Juvarek, is stationed on the other side of this tomb.

He is featured in \"K'lor'slug Infestation,\" a quest that requires the player to exterminate k'lor'slug's from Ajunta Pall's tomb on the planet Korriban. The quest is available to players who selected either the Sith Inquisitor or Sith Warrior class and is one of the first quests available to beginning players on Korriban that is not class-related. Upon the completion of the quest, the player receives fifteen in-game [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a pair of [[Boot/Legends|boots]] appropriate for the player's class. Cormun's quest does not give the player an opportunity to receive either [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] or [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points, and the player is not required to complete the quest in order to continue. However, this article is written with the assumption that the player fully completes the game. Cormun also speaks a line of dialogue warning Imperial players who were not Sith to avoid entering the tomb, but he does not try to stop them from entering.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nIn ''The Old Republic'', Cormun was originally going to a have a superior officer named [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Juvarek]].
