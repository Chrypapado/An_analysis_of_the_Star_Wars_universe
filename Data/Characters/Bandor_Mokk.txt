He was friend with [[Kyran Silene]].<ref name=\"web\" /> After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], a group of [[Corellian slavers]] operating near [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]] captured Kyran Silene and enslaved him.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> Silene and a group of slaves managed to escape the [[Corellian Slaver Bunker]]. Kyran Silene contacted Bandor Mokk but the Bothan was watched by [[Faye Patrick]], a member of the slave ring, who threatened his life.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> Because of that, Mokk, along with Faye Patrick, were suspected to be involved in the increase of missing persons on Corellia. [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Alana Walden]] was investigating the case, and pleaded with citizens to report Mokk's location to CorSec.<ref name=\"web\" />\n\nKyran's wife, [[Madison Silene]], later recruited a spacer to investigate the disappearance of her husband. The spacer met Bandor Mokk and convinced him to talk about Faye Patrick. The spacer therefore fought and killed Patrick in a street of Tyrena. After the death of Faye Patrick, Mokk accepted to reveal everything he knew about Kyran Silene and the escaped slaves.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> The spacer eventually met Kyran Silene in a camp outside the city and helped him to reveal the slavery operation to the CorSec.<ref name=\"SWG:IE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Incriminating Evidence|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBandor Mokk appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Bandor Mokk was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?id=66901&resource=features|text=Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives|archivedate=20111124014132}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Talk to Bandor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mokk, Bandor}}\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
