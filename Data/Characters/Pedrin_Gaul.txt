I'm trying to lose them. This is Red Five. I need help!|Pedrin Gaul|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}\n'''Pedrin Gaul''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who flew as a [[Rebel pilot]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], operating under the [[callsign]] \"[[Red Five]].\" He was once a [[transport]] [[pilot]] before helping fugitives who were hunted by the [[Galactic Empire]] escape from [[Denon]], for which he was branded a [[Treason|traitor]] of the Empire. He, as a [[Cadet]], was killed in action while flying his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] for the Alliance during the [[Battle of Scarif]]. Gaul's callsign was later taken by [[Luke Skywalker]], who destroyed the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] during the [[Battle of Yavin]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPedrin Gaul [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Denon]] and was born some time prior to the [[Galactic Civil War]]. On his homeworld, he was a [[transport]] [[pilot]] and ferried both passengers and freight throughout the metropolitan skylanes of Denon. He remained in this career until he helped fugitives who were hunted by the [[Galactic Empire]] escape from Denon. For his actions in this exodus, the Empire branded Gaul a [[Treason|traitor]] and he fled his homeworld.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\nGaul joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], became a [[cadet]] in the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], and was stationed at the [[Great Temple]] on [[Yavin 4]]. He flew a [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] for [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] and was given the [[callsign]] [[Red Five]].<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\n===Routine patrols===\nAt some point prior to [[0 BBY]], Gaul was scheduled Shift Cycle 2 of an X-wing flight patrol mission along with fellow pilots Cdt. [[Harb Binli]] ([[Red Seven]]) and [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Nozzo Naytaan]] ([[Red Nine]]). Their mission was to route from [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]] to [[Gordian Reach|Gordian]] Trace Relays, perform a flyby of surrounding space, then after verifying visual and sensor all clear, perform close uplink of passive relay recordings.<ref name=\"RebelFiles\">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref>\n\n===Battle of Scarif===\n{{Quote|Stick close, Red Five! Where are you going?|[[Garven Dreis]], to Pedrin Gaul|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:RedFive.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pedrin Gaul during the Battle of Scarif.]]\nLater, Gaul flew with his [[squadron]] during the [[Battle of Scarif]], where they and the rest of the Alliance Fleet provided support for [[Jyn Erso]] and her team, [[Rogue One]], as they fought to steal the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the Empire's planet-[[Death|killing]] [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. Gaul was killed in action during the battle, as the Alliance attempted to destroy the [[Shield Gate]] that protected [[Scarif]] and, for a time, prevented Rogue One from transmitting the Death Star plans to the Alliance Fleet. The plans were ultimately transmitted and given to [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nUpon the moment of Gaul's death, Admiral Raddus could hear his anguished scream over the starfighter's frequency.<ref name=\"Rogue One Novel\">[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:PedrinEnd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gaul's X-wing destroyed during the Battle of Scarif.]]\nThe Red Five callsign was left vacant as a result of Gaul's death. Not long after the Battle of Scarif, aspiring [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]] helped Princess Leia bring the plans stolen from Scarif to Yavin 4. The Alliance found the weakness built into the [[battle station]] by its designer,<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]],<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> and launched the [[Battle of Yavin]] to destroy the Death Star. Skywalker flew under the Red Five callsign and fired the shot that destroyed the Death Star, honoring the sacrifice of Pedrin Gaul and all those who died on Scarif.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Gaul_helmet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pedrin Gaul's flight helmet]]\nPedrin Gaul was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] with black [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and light skin.
