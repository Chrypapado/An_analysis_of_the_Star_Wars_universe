Jaxson had Imperial sympathies, but failed his entrance exam to the academy.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], he and Skywalker had a [[Skyhopper/Legends|Skyhopper]] race due to Jaxson's [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] beliefs and Skywalker's [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] ones. In the race, Jaxson fell behind Skywalker. Just before Skywalker was about to attempt to go through the [[Stone Needle/Legends|Stone Needle]], both of their skyhopper's electrical systems were wiped out by a [[Active sensor pulse generator|pulse generator]] put in the area by the bounty hunter [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]], who was capturing Skywalker for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]]. Bossk took them into a cave in the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]] to spend the night. There, Luke freed Jaxson and himself with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. They attempted to escape in Bossk's speeder, but Bossk woke up and attacked Luke. In the fight, Bossk lost an arm and a leg. Luke tried to get to the speeder to escape with Jaxson, but Bossk threw a [[Fragmentation grenade/Legends|Fragmentation grenade]] into the speeder. Jaxson and Luke survived the explosion, and Bossk declared that they would die together. Jaxson and Luke escaped into the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]]. There, Jaxson and Luke encountered a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] tribe, but Luke scared them away with a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|Krayt dragon]] call. Jaxson later saved Luke from falling off a cliff. Once they were rescued by [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who was on Tatooine with Luke, they were no longer enemies due to the fact that they had both saved each others life. They later participated in a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] shootout.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jaxson\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy captains of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
