My own petty anger has led me to bring this devastating war to the Republic&hellip;despite its pleasures and opulence, the Sith Empire is rotten to its core!|Gav Daragon|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 4}}\n'''Gav Daragon''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] [[Scout/Legends|explorer]] who lived in the years up to and during the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. At a young age, Daragon was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] but neglected to fully join the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. After his parents, [[Hok Daragon|Hok]] and [[Timar Daragon]], [[Death/Legends|died]] while running supplies to [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|besieged]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] on [[Kirrek]], Daragon and his sister, [[Jori Daragon]], inherited the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', one of their parents' [[Starship/Legends|starships]], and began careers as hyperspace trailblazers. However, trouble with [[Aarrba|creditors]] forced them to flee their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]] and take a blind hyperspace jump into an uncharted area of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to avoid [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] and the authorities. When they pulled out of hyperspace, they stumbled upon the legendary [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], which had been isolated for millennia. Although Daragon tried to keep the meeting with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] peaceful, he and his sister were [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] by the reigning [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]].\n\nDaragon and his sister were due to be executed, but they were rescued by one of the most powerful Sith Lords in the Sith Empire, [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]]. Gav and Jori Daragon were hidden in Sadow's [[Naga Sadow's Khar Shian citadel|secret fortress]] on [[Khar Shian]], where Sadow discovered Daragon's [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]] and began to [[Sith training|train]] him in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Sadow was an expansionist and preached to Daragon that he would assist the Sith in a coming war with the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Meanwhile, Sadow was in a power dispute with another Sith Lord, [[Ludo Kressh]], leading Kressh to [[Battle of Khar Delba|attack]] Sadow's [[Naga Sadow's Khar Delba citadel|citadel]] at [[Khar Delba]]. Sadow was victorious, and in the chaos he allowed Jori to escape in the ''Starbreaker 12''. With nothing standing in his way, Sadow&mdash;as new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]&mdash;placed his new [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] Daragon in charge of the Sith fleets and launched a two-pronged attack on the Galactic Republic, with major battles [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Hyperspace War)|commencing on]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]].\n\nDaragon personally [[Commander/Legends|commanded]] the [[Battle of Koros Major (Great Hyperspace War)|attack]] on Koros Major but, hoping to find his sister on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] below, took a [[Dropship/Legends|dropship]] down to his former home [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]]. Daragon sought help from an old acquaintance, Aarrba, the owner of [[Aarrba's Repair Dock]], but the old [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] merely spat in his face. Interpreting this move as an attack, Daragon's Sith [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] guards slew the Hutt. As a shocked Daragon stood over Aarrba's body, he was confronted by Jori, who blamed him for Aarrba's death. Overwhelmed by emotion, Daragon fled from his sister and returned to his [[Gav Daragon's flagship|flagship]].\n\nNo longer loyal to Naga Sadow due to the destruction that the war had caused to both his former home and his relationship with Jori, and feeling that he needed to put a stop to the violence, Daragon went to [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]], where Sadow was cloistered in his [[Naga Sadow's Mothership|Sith Meditation Sphere]], [[Sith magic|conjuring]] [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|illusions]] for the war effort. Daragon [[Battle at Primus Goluud|fired]] on Sadow, breaking the Dark Lord's concentration; however, Sadow was able to convince Daragon to meet him face-to-face. When Daragon arrived on the [[Sith Meditation Sphere|meditation sphere]], he realized that he had been tricked; the damaged sphere was empty. The [[Koros fleet]] soon arrived in-[[Star system/Legends|system]] along with Jori, and Daragon gave them the [[Galactic coordinates/Legends|coordinates]] to the Sith Empire's home worlds. Telling his sister goodbye, Daragon was soon killed by solar flares that were [[Supernova (Sith magic)|summoned]] by Sadow. The Koros military took Daragon's coordinates and [[Second battle of Korriban|attacked]] Sadow at [[Korriban]], routing him and ending the Great Hyperspace War.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Gav Daragon was born on the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]<ref name=\"wizards\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050414planet2|text=Byss and the Deep Core Part 2|int=Byss and the Deep Core|archivedate=20091230032049}}</ref> [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]].<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> He was the child of [[Starship/Legends|starship]] operators [[Hok Daragon|Hok]] and [[Timar Daragon]] and had a sister, [[Jori Daragon]].<ref name=\"conquest\" /> At some point in Daragon's childhood, he was found to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] arts.

The war went very well for Teta and her forces, as they were able to successfully unite six of the seven worlds in mutual commerce and aid. However, Koros [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] on the seventh world, [[Kirrek]], had become encircled and [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|besieged]] by [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] and rebels<ref name=\"conquest\" /> led by a man named [[Llaban]].<ref name=\"encounter\" /> While the Koros soldiers were being besieged, many supply runners in civilian ships were called into action to run supplies to the soldiers, including Hok and Timar Daragon. Before their parents' mission, the Daragon siblings accompanied them to [[Aarrba's Repair Dock]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]], a starship repair yard owned by a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] named [[Aarrba]], to get their parents' main ship, the ''[[Shadow Runner]]'', repaired. Aarrba restored the ship for only a percentage of the Daragons' profits, and Daragon and his sister then offered to follow in the Daragons' other ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]''. However, their parents refused, saying that it was too dangerous. Aarrba had decided to keep the ''Starbreaker 12'' as collateral until the Daragons returned, ruling out any possibility that their children could follow.<ref name=\"conquest\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Koros forces on Kirrek were joined by two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]: Empress Teta's personal [[Advisor/Legends|advisor]], [[Memit Nadill]], and [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], a [[Draethos (species)|Draethos]] scholar who had never seen battle before. Together, the two Jedi used an exotic [[Force power/Legends|Force power]] known as [[battle meditation]], which could strengthen the morale and resolve of the Koros soldiers and heighten the fears and doubts of the Kirrek rebels. The use of the ability turned out to be an enormous success, and the Koros forces were able to drive back the rebels. However, the battle meditation had an unexpected side-effect, as it unleashed the last reserves of desperation for the rebels. They began firing at the weakest targets so as to eliminate as many as possible before they themselves were doomed for defeat. The ''Shadow Runner'' arrived at Kirrek soon after and was set upon by the pirate guns. Hok and Timar attempted to fly in low and fast and drop the cargo but were unable to take sufficient evasive action, and the ship was destroyed. Daragon and his sister were still at Aarrba's Repair Dock during the battle, working on repairs for the ''Starbreaker 12''. When Aarrba received word about Hok and Timar's [[Death/Legends|death]], he attempted to inform the Daragon siblings; they initially believed that the news was that their parents were returning home. However, Aarrba revealed that their parents had been killed and gave them the ''Starbreaker 12'', telling them that their parents had paid for it in [[Blood/Legends|blood]]. While Daragon and his sister were shocked and saddened at first, they decided to take the ''Starbreaker 12'' and explore [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], hoping to honor their parents' memory.<ref name=\"conquest\" />\n\n===Into the unknown===\n{{Quote|This is the one! I can feel it!|Gav Daragon, before jumping into hyperspace|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 1}}\nNow in ownership of the ''Starbreaker 12'', Gav and Jori Daragon became [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] [[Scout/Legends|explorers]]. The two were not particularly successful and acquired debts to numerous creditors, including Aarrba, but Daragon remained continually optimistic about their chances of blazing a trail that would bring in lucrative profits. One of their most successful endeavors was the [[Goluud Corridor]], a route passing through the [[Primus Goluud system|Goluud system]]. The route was approved by the bureaucrat [[Shodon Ko]] of the [[Hyperspace Navigator's Guild|Navigators' Guild]], but its assigned risk factor was high, as it crossed dangerously close to the system's unstable red supergiant [[Star/Legends|star]], [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]]. During their travels, the Daragons gained a reputation with [[Cinnagar Control]] of being both reckless and persistent explorers. The pair's debts accumulated, forcing them to sell their dwelling in Cinnagar to Aarrba as collateral for repairs after one run. One day, Daragon and his sister went on a hyperspace jump that the former had a good feeling about; the two tried to navigate the treacherous [[Starswarm Cluster/Legends|Starswarm Cluster]], a route that could potentially net them a fortune from the Navigators' Guild. They made it through the Cluster, but their ship sustained damage, and they only succeeded in mapping a dangerous trail that not returned them any profit. Daragon and his sister were left to limp back to Koros and lost several more critical parts during the journey. The two made their way to Aarrba's Repair Dock, but Aarrba was hesitant to help them, stating that they had no more collateral to offer him. However, the Hutt agreed to repair the ship on one condition: Aarrba would keep the ''Starbreaker 12'' at his dock until repairs were paid in full.<ref name=\"unknown\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Memit_Nadill--Odan-Urr.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gav and Jori Daragon are saved from assassins by Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill.]]\nSoon afterward, Daragon received word from Shodon Ko that a [[Cha'a]] merchant lord named [[Ssk Kahorr]] had used the Goluud Corridor and that a substantial bonus was coming. Daragon took this as a source of pride and quickly informed Aarrba of the incoming money that he would use to pay for the ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} repairs. After leaving Aarrba's Repair Dock, Daragon was accosted by two armed men who informed them that Ssk Kahorr wanted him and Jori dead. The men told him that Kahorr was angry, as the Goluud Corridor had resulted in the destruction of one of his ships, and that Shodon Ko had been recently found murdered. After this incident, Daragon returned to Jori on the Cinnagar streets and recounted his encounter with the men, but also assured her that he would petition the Navigators' Guild for their money. However, they were interrupted by the same two men that Daragon had encountered earlier; this time, the men revealed their allegiance to Ssk Kahorr and attacked. Daragon and Jori attempted to escape, and were pursued through the streets on Cinnagar, before being cornered in a dead-end alley. However, they were saved by Memit Nadill and Odan-Urr, who happened to be passing through the area. One of the attackers was slain by Odan-Urr's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], and the other fled. Nadill warned Daragon and his sister that the two were not safe in Cinnagar, or on all of Koros, and the two decided to leave the system. Finding themselves without a way to get off-world, Daragon came up with the idea to steal the ''Starbreaker 12'' and escape. Jori agreed, and they took the ship; they left Aarrba's dock with no trouble but were forced to take evasive action once in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] to escape security ships. Jori entered random coordinates into the [[Navigation computer/Legends|navicomputer]], and the two fled into the unknown.<ref name=\"unknown\" />\n\n===The Sith Empire===\n{{Quote|Greetings from the Republic! We come in peace!|Gav Daragon greets the Sith on Korriban|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 2}}\n[[File:Daragons_on_Korriban.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Daragons arrive on Korriban.]]\nThe ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} flight path in hyperspace took her farther than any recorded vessel from [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Realspace/Legends|space]] had ever gone. After a long trip, Daragon decided to pull the ''Starbreaker 12'' out of hyperspace. When they reverted to realspace, they found themselves overlooking a [[Korriban|mysterious world]]. It was only then that they realized how far they had gone; Daragon checked the navicomputer, and saw that they were in a remote, unmapped section of the galaxy. However, the return course was locked in the navicomputer so that they would be able to find their way home. With a smile, Daragon assured Jori that their route would make them an untold fortune from the Navigators' Guild. Daragon was unsure if the dark world before them was inhabited and decided to touch down and explore, realizing that he and his sister were representing the Republic. Daragon landed the ship in a [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|monument-filled valley]] and introduced himself and his sister to the planet's inhabitants. Much to their surprise, the Daragons were not welcomed by the natives but were instead promptly arrested and detained. Little did Daragon know that he and his sister had stumbled across the fabled [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], which had been isolated from the galaxy for centuries. He had landed in the middle of the [[Funeral of Marka Ragnos|funeral]] of the recently deceased [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Marka Ragnos]], which had degenerated into a [[Lightsaber/Legends|duel]] between two [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]], [[Ludo Kressh]] and [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]].<ref name=\"funeral\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 2]]</ref>\n\nNow [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]], Daragon and his sister were kept in the [[Prison/Legends|prisoner level]] in a [[Sith Citadel (Ziost)|fortress]] on the planet [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Empire. Meanwhile, in the levels above, a great debate raged concerning the Daragons' future. The more conservative Ludo Kressh wanted them to be killed immediately, contending that they were precursors to a Republic invasion, while the progressive Naga Sadow wanted to keep them alive, insisting that they possessed vital information that could facilitate expansion of the Sith Empire. In the dungeons, Daragon struggled to keep his optimism, noting that all great explorers occasionally fell upon hard times. Finally, the two were approached in their cell by a Sith Lord named [[Simus]], who informed them that their fate had been decided: they were to be executed as soon as possible. Daragon was irate at this news and protested that they had not been given a fair trial and that they had given the Sith no information whatsoever, but these complaints fell on deaf ears. Unbeknownst to the Daragons, however, Naga Sadow had formulated a plan to free Daragon and his sister, so as to bring about renewed contact with the Republic.<ref name=\"fabric\" />\n\nSadow secretly took a task force of Sith [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] [[warrior]]s to Ziost and attacked the fortress. Sadow ordered the Massassi to go to the prisoner level and take the Daragons in order to ensure that the siblings were not harmed. At the time, the Daragons were at their most distraught, huddled together and lamenting their fate. Daragon surmised that he should have continued his Jedi training and bemoaned the fact that the random spin of the navicomputer coordinates had brought them here. When he heard the Massassi coming, Daragon straightened up and vowed not to go down without a fight. However, they were greeted not by executioners, but by Naga Sadow, who had eliminated the guards. Sadow told the Daragons that he was rescuing them and ordered them to follow the Massassi to his ship. Sadow had Daragon taken to his [[Naga Sadow's Khar Shian citadel|hidden fortress]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Khar Shian]], while he returned to Ziost for an urgent meeting of Sith. Daragon and his sister were finally safe.<ref name=\"fabric\" />\n\n===Sadow's apprentice===\n{{Quote|The Sith magic you learn will be a powerful ally in our coming struggle.|Naga Sadow, to Gav Daragon|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 4}}\n[[File:GavSithMagic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gav Daragon practices the Sith magic taught to him by Naga Sadow.]]\nUpon reaching Khar Shian, Daragon and his sister were split up, with Jori being brought to Sadow's [[Naga Sadow's Khar Delba citadel|decoy fortress]] on [[Khar Delba]]. Although Sadow insisted that Daragon was not a prisoner, the young man was soon overwhelmed by boredom. In the meantime, Naga Sadow recognized Daragon's [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-sensitivity and taught him several rudimentary techniques in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], powers that Daragon realized were very different from those he had learned from the Jedi. Daragon was also educated in the exotic arts of [[Sith magic]]. Sadow encouraged Daragon and revealed to him that he harbored a very strong, undeveloped talent. Daragon learned that Sadow expected him to become a Force adept before the Human would be allowed to return home. Unbeknownst to Daragon, Sadow was working in his own machinations in the meantime; he staged a Republic attack on the ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]]&mdash;which was under Kressh's direct control&mdash;and had his men steal the ship. Arriving after the attack had taken place, Ludo Kressh was infuriated when he found Sadow's emblem at the scene. Angered by Sadow's treachery, Kressh gathered two of his allies, [[Horak-mul]] and [[Dor Gal-ram]], and launched an [[Battle of Khar Delba|attack]] on Sadow.<ref name=\"pawns\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 4|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 4]]</ref>\n\nKressh and his allies attacked Khar Delba with all their firepower. On Khar Shian, Daragon noticed the fire of the battle and was bewildered by the occurrences, having no knowledge of the current events. When he tried to ask the Massassi guards what was going on, they refused to respond. Although Daragon was distraught at being out of the loop, he supposed that Sadow knew what he was doing and was solely concerned with his sister Jori's safety. Eventually, Daragon discovered a way to monitor the battle from Khar Shian and surmised that Naga Sadow could use all his time to teach him Sith abilities, as he was the only student that Sadow had left. Additionally, Daragon discovered that the ''Starbreaker 12'' was gone; with Sadow's help, Jori had escaped the Sith Empire in the ship. Meanwhile, in the battle, Sadow used deception and trickery to decimate Kressh's fleet. Defeated, Kressh fled.<ref name=\"flight\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 5|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===Preparations===\n{{Quote|The glory of the Sith Empire will endure forever.

Anyone can see that.|Naga Sadow, to Gav Daragon|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 1}}\n[[File:GavAndSadow.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gav Daragon and Naga Sadow at a war rally on Ch'hodos]]\nOn Khar Delba, Daragon was at Naga Sadow's side while he oversaw the reconstruction and repairs to the citadel that had been attacked by Kressh. During this time, Sadow&mdash;who had risen to be the new Dark Lord of the Sith with Kressh's defeat&mdash;gave him jewels and boasted about the opulence and glory of the Sith Empire, stating that the Republic would give them everything they needed. Although Daragon was initially reluctant to help Sadow strike at the Republic, memories of his suffering and destitute life on Koros Major following his parents' death, accompanied with Sadow's persuasion, convinced him otherwise. By that time, Sadow had gained the support of all the other Sith Lords. One day, Sadow had Daragon accompany him to a meeting on the newly repaired citadel on Khar Delba, where Sadow proclaimed that the Sith Empire's fleet was ready to move out across the [[Hyperlane|starlanes]] and attack the Republic. However, Sadow was interrupted by an urgent message; Ludo Kressh had returned in his [[Ludo Kressh's flagship|flagship]]. Sadow and Daragon promptly received a communiqu\u00e9 from Kressh, who proclaimed that Sadow was a traitor. After hearing this message, Daragon was ordered to activate the automated systems that would jam the transmission. However, when Daragon turned the system on, the citadel's turrets activated, destroying the ship and seemingly killing Kressh. Daragon was furious at Sadow's trickery, as he had never killed before, but Sadow reassured him that he had done an important deed, clearing the way on the road to the Republic. Sadow then revealed that he had placed a [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracking device]] on the ''Starbreaker 12'', showing to them the way back to the Republic, and that the time had come to attack.<ref name=\"desperate\" />\n\nWith war preparations in full swing, Daragon went with Sadow to [[Ch'hodos]], the central base of the Sith Lord [[Shar Dakhan]], for a military rally. It was there that Daragon learned from Sadow that he would be remembered in history as a victorious hero upon his return to the Republic. Daragon replied that he was only excited to see Jori again and told Sadow of his desire to keep her safe during the fighting; Sadow assured him that the fighting would not last long and would end in a rout. Meanwhile, preparations continued, with Sadow amassing a large [[Sith invasion fleet|force]] from all corners of the Sith Empire, including a substantial fleet and an even larger [[Army/Legends|army]] of ground [[Troop/Legends|troops]] and war beasts. When the Sith force was finally ready, the fleet gathered near Khar Shian, which served as the army's staging point. Daragon took up post on Naga Sadow's [[Naga Sadow's Mothership|personal Sith Meditation Sphere]]. With the war's beginning in sight, Daragon questioned the strategy of leaving the Sith Empire's worlds undefended while the fleet went to fight the Republic. However, Sadow replied that they needed to focus on their new target. Sadow then gave Daragon a large responsibility; because of his service and knowledge of the Republic, Sadow appointed Daragon the commander of the force from the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of Sadow's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]]. Although Daragon was hesitant to do so, as he had never commanded anything before, he ultimately accepted the offer. Now ready to fight, the Sith force launched to initiate the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]].<ref name=\"collision\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===The Great Hyperspace War===\n{{Quote|Cinnagar&hellip; what have I done to my city?|Gav Daragon, during the Battle of Koros Major|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\n[[File:Battle_of_Koros_Major.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gav Daragon's dropship approaches Cinnagar.]]\nFollowing the ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} beacon, the massive Sith fleet arrived in the Koros system and immediately found the ''Starbreaker 12'' flying in local space. Daragon was shocked, believing that he had found Jori. However, despite Daragon's protests, Sadow ordered his men to lock onto the ship and fire, obliterating the ship. Angered, Daragon hoped that Jori was not on the ship; Sadow responded by telling Daragon to check his sensors, which showed that there were no Human lifeforms on the ''Starbreaker 12''. Sadow then set the plan into motion, ordering the fleet to split in two. One part attacked the Koros system, while the remainder of the force [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Hyperspace War)|struck]] at the heart of the Republic, [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Withdrawing to his [[Sith Meditation Sphere|meditation sphere]], Sadow informed Daragon that he would be leading the main fleet. Daragon led the Sith force on a large [[Battle of Koros Major (Great Hyperspace War)|attack]] on the Koros system, fighting both Teta's soldiers and Llaban's fighters&mdash;who had joined forces with the Empress&mdash;on Kirrek. With the battle fully underway, Daragon decided to personally land in Cinnagar with a contingent of Massassi guards, believing that if he could shut down Cinnagar's defenses, they would win a near-bloodless victory. He also hoped to find Jori amidst the chaos.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\nDaragon took the trip back to Cinnagar in a Sith [[Dropship/Legends|dropship]] and wept upon seeing the devastation that he had inflicted upon his city. He landed near Aarrba's Repair Dock and entered the shop, hoping to find Jori, as his pendant was glowing. Daragon pleaded with Aarrba for his help; however, the aged Hutt merely spat in his face. Interpreting the move as an attack on their commander, the Massassi guards attacked Aarrba, stabbing him in the abdomen with a spear. Mortally wounded, the Hutt's last act was to crush his assailants by rolling off his [[Hoversled/Legends|hoversled]] onto them. Shocked, Daragon reprimanded the remaining guards, saying that Aarrba's action had not been an attack. At that moment, Jori Daragon entered Aarrba's Repair Dock and, upon witnessing the scene, blamed Daragon for Aarrba's death. Stunned and grieved, Jori proclaimed that Daragon was not the brother that she knew. She withdrew a lightsaber, given to her by Odan-Urr before the battle, and attacked and killed the Massasi guards.<ref name=\"encounter\" /> Jori confronted Daragon, asking why he had done all the things he did.

He knew that he needed to stop Naga Sadow and end the war. Daragon ordered the battleship to go into hyperspace, along his old route the Goluud Corridor, and head for the Goluud system, where Sadow was waiting in his meditation sphere. Sitting alone on the bridge, Daragon pondered the events of the Great Hyperspace War and expressed his extreme regret at the deaths that he had caused. His faith in the Sith Empire shattered, Daragon ordered the ship's [[Gunner/Legends|gunners]] to fire on Sadow's meditation sphere, where Sadow was sequestered conjuring [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|illusions]] to assist the war effort. The attack did indeed break Sadow's concentration, and on both Coruscant and Koros, Sadow's illusions disappeared into nothingness, causing the battles to turn in favor of the Republic. Sadow messaged Daragon, asking that he come to the meditation sphere to face him, and he accepted. Upon reaching the meditation sphere, however, Daragon found it empty and realized that he had been tricked.<ref name=\"dogs\" />\n\nA message from Sadow came over the intercom speakers, calling Daragon a traitor and announcing that he would deal with him after the fighting had finished. Inside the damaged sphere, Daragon frantically searched for a working system, finding that only the [[Comlink/Legends|comm]] operated properly. Daragon attempted to contact Teta's forces, and they arrived almost immediately, including both Jori and Empress Teta, who told Daragon to surrender and prepare to be boarded. Daragon instead told them that the Sith Empire had left their home worlds undefended and that the Koros fleet could attack and seal victory. However, at that moment, the remnants of Sadow's battered fleet arrived in the Goluud system, [[Battle at Primus Goluud|attacking]] the Koros forces. Sadow, now in control, used a secret weapon to trigger solar flares in the unstable Primus Goluud. Knowing what Sadow had done would surely kill him, Daragon told Jori and the Koros forces to escape while they still could. Sadow's forces fled back to the Sith Empire, while Jori could not bring herself to leave her brother. Gav Daragon's final words were to tell his sister goodbye, and the Koros forces left the Goluud system while Daragon perished in the meditation sphere.<ref name=\"dogs\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:GavJoriDaragon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gav and Jori Daragon]]\nBack on Cinnagar, Gav Daragon's sister Jori took over operations on Aarrba's Repair Dock after the conclusion of the war.<ref name=\"end\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 5|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 5]]</ref> Years after his lifetime, Gav Daragon was remembered for his role in starting the Great Hyperspace War,<ref name=\"Firestorm\">{{Journal|15|Firestorm (short story)|''Firestorm''}}</ref> including in a [[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force|compilation]] of Jedi history and lore created by the [[Jedi historian]] [[Tionne Solusar]] in [[40 ABY]]. In the years after the Daragons, some historians pointed out that the Great Hyperspace War might have been avoided had Jedi Odan-Urr not saved the Daragons from Kahorr's [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]], but Solusar believed that the Daragons could not be held responsible for the start of the war.<ref name=\"EGTTF\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref> The pair's role was long remembered throughout history for blazing what was considered one of the most remarkable hyperlanes of the [[Old Republic era]].

Every time he went on a hyperspace run, he was always convinced that it would be the one that would get him and Jori their fortune.<ref name=\"unknown\" /> Even after countless failures, he never lost his optimism, and when he and Jori were confined to a small, cramped cell in the Sith Empire, Daragon still preached that it could be worse.<ref name=\"fabric\" /> His optimism was only surpassed by his love and caring for his sister Jori, which led him to willingly serve Naga Sadow to help him to give her a better life.<ref name=\"desperate\" /> Daragon would do anything to help Jori, including aiding in the attack on his home Cinnagar and the Galactic Republic as a whole.<ref name=\"encounter\" /> Even with the end of his life drawing near and the Koros forces' order for him to surrender, Daragon helped Jori by telling them of the Sith Empire's crucial weakness and then to leave before they were killed by Primus Goluud's solar flares.<ref name=\"dogs\" /> Although he only aided Sadow to help Jori, Daragon came to greatly regret his complicity in the Great Hyperspace War. In his dropship, finally witnessing the destruction that he had wrought upon his home, Daragon wept for his role in igniting the conflict. Also, when confronted by Jori in Aarrba's Repair Dock, Daragon could not bring himself to explain his actions, overwhelmed by grief and remorse.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\nGav Daragon was a very daring individual; even as a relatively young and inexperienced pilot, he still offered to accompany his parents on a very dangerous mission to run supplies to the besieged Koros soldiers on Kirrek.<ref name=\"conquest\" /> When confronted by Kahorr's bounty, Daragon recklessly stole his ship from Aarrba's Repair Dock, made a daring escape from Cinnagar security forces, and fearlessly jumped into unknown territory.<ref name=\"unknown\" /> He did not fear meeting the Sith upon making his first landing on Korriban and instead greeted them with a smile.<ref name=\"funeral\" /> He quickly lost faith and became apathetic and distraught when they were imprisoned on Ziost.<ref name=\"fabric\" /> However, by the end of his apprenticeship to Naga Sadow, Daragon had regained his nerve. Knowingly disobeying Sadow, Daragon rebelled and tried to eliminate his [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]] over Primus Goluud, knowing that he had a chance to end the violence. Although aware of the risks, Daragon still decided to go across to Sadow's Sith Meditation Sphere to face him down. Despite being tricked, Daragon did not panic and was able to guide his sister and the Koros forces to safety in the last moments of his life.<ref name=\"dogs\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|You have a powerful innate talent, Gav Daragon.|Naga Sadow|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 4}}\nGav Daragon was naturally Force-sensitive, and in his childhood, his affinity for the Force was strong enough that he was trained in the Jedi arts by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]. Although he declined to fully join the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"unknown\" /> he still recalled some of the techniques that he was taught, while in adulthood. This Force-sensitivity was later rediscovered by Naga Sadow, who trained him in the dark side of the Force and in the techniques of Sith magic. Daragon remarked that the powers taught to him by Sadow, including the ability to conjure illusions, were radically different from the ones taught to him by the Jedi.<ref name=\"flight\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Gav Daragon was conceived and written by [[Kevin J. Anderson]]<ref>[[Wookieepedia:Interview/Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin J. Anderson interview, conducted by Greyman]]</ref> for the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series and first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi &mdash; The Golden Age of the Sith]]'', Anderson's second solo story arc following the conclusion of ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]''. For the first five issues of ''The Golden Age of the Sith'' series, he was sketched by penciller [[Dario Carrasco, Jr.]], and black-and-white drawings of the character were included in the back of the first issue of ''The Golden Age of the Sith''. He subsequently appeared in one later installment of ''Tales of the Jedi'' that was entitled [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire|''The Fall of the Sith Empire'']], and various reference materials describing the events and characters of the series, including ''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' and ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'', both by [[Daniel Wallace]]. The Daragon Trail was later explicitly placed and drawn in the [[2009]] reference book ''The Essential Atlas.'' Gav Daragon also was depicted in that work, with the illustration drawn by [[Chris Trevas]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /> Although Gav Daragon's eyes were said to be blue in ''The New Essential Guide to Characters'',<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> they are clearly brown in both of the ''Tales of the Jedi'' arcs in which he appears.<ref name=\"dogs\" /> This article uses the ''The New Essential Guide to Characters'', as it is the only source that explicitly states the eye color.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Golden Age of the Sith]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Timeline 12: The Great Hyperspace War]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|15|Firestorm (short story)|''Firestorm''}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Delusions of Grandeur]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Ascension'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|8|ComicScan|ComicScan: Taken by Force}}\n*{{InsiderCite|30|Lucasfilm's Latest}} {{Po}}\n*''[[The Dark Side Sourcebook]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|133|KOR3, ''Korriban''}}\n*{{FFCite|140|HUT15-16, ''The Hutts''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=swminis/article/rotspreview9|text=''Revenge of the Sith'' Preview 9|int=Revenge of the Sith Preview 9|archivedate=20090604050446}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Panel to Panel Volume 2: Expanding the Universe]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|aarrba|Aarrba the Hutt|archivedate=20100328101446}}\n*''[[The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural (real-life book)|''The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural'']]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Force and Destiny'' Core Rulebook]]\n*''[[Star Wars Year By Year: A Visual History, New Edition]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|bg=\u0413\u0430\u0432 \u0414\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\n|de=Gav Daragon\n|es=Gav Daragon\n|fr=Gav Daragon\n|ja=\u30b2\u30a4\u30f4\u30fb\u30c0\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\n|pl=Gav Daragon\n|pt=Legends:Gav Daragon\n|ru=\u0413\u044d\u0432 \u0414\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daragon, Gav}}\n[[Category:Former Sith]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sith of the Sith Empire]]\n[[Category:Sith rejects]]\n[[Category:Sith sorcerers]]\n[[Category:Space explorers]]\n[[Category:Tetans]]"}}}]}}}}
