When her deceitful ways were revealed, her family abandoned her on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. She could often be seen at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] sitting in a stupor, reflecting on her past. She was also sometimes mistakenly called \"Rachalt Hyst\", but was still referred to as \"Zutmore\" by the [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]]. Like all Snivvians, she was nicknamed \"Snaggletooth\" by other [[Species/Legends|species]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn [[1978]], the [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] toy company created a figure of the [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]], [[Zutton/Legends|Zutton]]. The first version wore a blue outfit and was the same size as a regular action figure. It was released with the Sears Cantina Adventure Playset. A second, revised version with a red outfit and shorter legs was released as an individually packaged action figure. The first version was labeled \"Blue Snaggletooth\" and became a very rare figure. The package of the second figure included a picture of Zutmore from the ''Holiday Special''. This seemed to imply that the Snivvian in ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' was the same Snivvian, Zutton, that appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. However, Zutton has a different appearance than the Snivvian in the ''Holiday Special'', and it was decided to split the appearances into separate characters.<ref name=\"Star Wars Blog\">{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-cantina-we-may-not-thrive-friend-but-we-survive-friend|text=''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' Cantina: Who's Who|int=The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who}}</ref>\n\nTo add to the confusion, in [[2001]], [[Hasbro Inc.|Hasbro]] produced a figure under the name \"Zutton,\" but the figure actually resembles Zutmore.<ref name=\"rebelscum.com\">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: Power of the Jedi|pack=Zutton (Snaggletooth)|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/POTJzutton.asp|archivedate=20190828060854}}</ref> Around the same time, [[Decipher, Inc.|Decipher]] identified Zutmore as \"Rachalt Hyst\" for its [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|''Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game]] set, ''[[Tatooine Limited]]''.
