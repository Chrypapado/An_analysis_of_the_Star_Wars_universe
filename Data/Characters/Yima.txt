She was a member of its internal investigation branch, and investigated how the [[Batu Rem impostor]] infiltrated the TSF.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn cut content of ''Knights of the Old Republic II'', Lieutenant Yima was supposed to be able to meet the Jedi Exile. Yima would give the Exile a quest to expose Lieutenant [[Atallo]], a corrupt TSF officer who oversaw the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] hangar bay. The dialog from this suggests that Yima was the older dock officer of the hangar bay in which the Ebon Hawk landed in.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Yima\n|pl=Yima\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Judicial Forces officers]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
