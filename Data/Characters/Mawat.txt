While initially he followed the leaders [[Nield]] and [[Cerasi]], soon after peace was declared he began to crave power. Mawat began arming both members of the Young as well as the Elders, to attempt to escalate the conflict on the planet. This attempt to create conflict both succeeded and failed, however; one of the sharpshooters armed and placed by Mawat shot Cerasi, causing the leaders on both sides grief.\n\nHowever, Mawat pressed on with his mission. Conflict was inevitable, until former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Nield, and Cerasi's father interceded. Mawat and his followers laid down their weapons, and the [[Last Battle of Zehava]] was over.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mawat\n|es=Mawat\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Melida/Daan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
