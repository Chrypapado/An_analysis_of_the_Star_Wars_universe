In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Domaz was [[Bombing of Domaz|assaulted]] by [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]''. The attack was in retaliation for the population of Kolatill overthrowing their Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]] in the wake of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberation]] of the nearby planet of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]]. With the city devastated, Bennor began to organize relief efforts from a park that had been converted into an emergency aid station. He accepted help from the crew of the New Republic [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] ''[[FarStar]]''&mdash;who had responded to a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]] from the planet&mdash;in providing [[Medic/Legends|medical]] assistance and enlisted their services to retrieve more supplies from a [[Bomb/Legends|bombed]]-out [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]].\n\n==Biography==\nLon Bennor was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] who resided on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kolatill]] in the [[Kathol sector]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], and lived in the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Domaz]].<ref name=\"O\" /> In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberated]] the planet of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]], the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] capital. As a result, the local [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Kentor Sarne]]&mdash;who had set himself up as a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|death]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] [[4 ABY/Legends|four years]] previously&mdash;was forced to flee his capital with the majority of his [[Moff Sarne's forces|forces]].<ref name=\"TSB\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref> When news of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol reached the population of Kolatill, they staged a popular uprising, overthrowing and [[Prison/Legends|imprisoning]] their Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Tetrum]], and reinstating the [[Kolatill Council]] to lead them.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nShortly after this act of rebellion, the Imperial [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' arrived [[Kolatill system|in-system]] and used [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] to [[Bombing of Domaz|assault]] Domaz. Bennor survived the devastation wrought on his home and immediately began to organize relief efforts from a park at the heart of the city that had been converted into an emergency aid station. He blamed the Kolatill Council for the attack, since they had publicly declared allegiance to the New Republic after being reinstated into power.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n{{RPGseed}}\nFour [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the attack, the crew of the New Republic [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'' arrived to assist in relief operations. Bennor was not particularly pleased to see them, as they were representatives of the government that had indirectly been the cause of the attack on Domaz. However, he did accept their assistance and [[Medic/Legends|medical]] supplies, since his priorities were saving as many lives as possible. Bennor also requested the assistance of ''FarStar'' crew members when he went to a [[Bomb/Legends|bombed]]-out [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]] to retrieve much needed medical supplies. With their help, he was able to overcome collapsing floors, [[Fire/Legends|fires]], and other hazards to recover the supplies.<ref name=\"O\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLon Bennor cared greatly for his home city and thought nothing of volunteering his time and skills to assist it and its people in their time of need. Despite his youth, he was a capable leader, organizing relief efforts and missions to retrieve needed supplies. However, his anger and frustration at the situation affected his judgment, leading him into tense situations. Even though he was not enthusiastic about the arrival of crew members from the ''FarStar'' due to their association with the New Republic, he was not too proud to ask for their help if it assisted him in saving the lives of his fellow citizens.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLon Bennor's only appearance was in the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[Omens]]'', which was written by [[Bill Smith]] and included as one of the scenarios in ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' published by [[West End Games]] in [[1995]]. The gamemaster was not obliged to use Bennor in the adventure, but the character could be used to assist the players in roleplaying their own characters in a tense situation since Bennor was not overly friendly to the New Republic, and as a hook for a minor adventure to a bombed-out hospital.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{1st}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bennor, Lon}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kolatill residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
