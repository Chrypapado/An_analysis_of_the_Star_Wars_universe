In [[3956 BBY]], he raced on the [[Ahto City swoop track]], and met the mind-wiped [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during his visit to Manaan.\n\n==Biography==\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nDuring his quest for the [[Star Forge]], Revan met Molto, who shared his troubles with him. Molto was a skilled [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racer]], but he could not keep up with the other racers due to expensive modifications to their [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]]. Revan gave him five hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to buy the upgrades. Sometime later, Revan returned to the Manaan swoop track to find that Queedle had become the Sector Champion, and repaid Revan the full amount he loaned him. But Molto's fame was short-lived when Revan himself beat his time and became Sector Champion. Regardless, he was always grateful to Revan for helping him achieve a better place among the swoop racing community.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEven though he is shown as an Ithorian, he is referred to as an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] by the two [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] who talk outside of the swoop racer administration who also state that his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] is [[Ando/Legends|Ando]]. It is possible that Molto was meant to be Aqualish, as Aqualish and Ithorians have the same dialogue audio in the game.\n\nIf the player beats Queedle Molto's time and has not already given him the credits needed to upgrade, then Molto quits swoop racing altogether.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=Manaan Sector Swoop Race Champion\n|years=[[3956 BBY]]\n|before=[[Hukta Jax]]\n|after=[[Revan/Legends|Revan]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Queedle Molto\n|fi=Queedle Molto\n|pl=Queedle Molto\n|ru=\u041a\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043b \u041c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Molto, Queedle}}\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]"}}}]}}}}
