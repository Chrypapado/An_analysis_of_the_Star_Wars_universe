This was possibly a result of his violent temper, which had resulted in him being transferred out of a number of units by their commanders, because he would demonstrate his loyalty to the Empire by berating fellow officers for even minor offences. He served on Felucia as [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vischera]]'s second-in-command when an [[Alderaanian Resistance]] team [[Mission to Felucia (Imperial Period)|attacked]] the facility.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Traitor's Gambit|int=The Traitor's Gambit|archivedate=20100118064618}}\n\n[[Category:Felucia residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
