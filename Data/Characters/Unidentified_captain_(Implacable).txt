When the tide of battle began to favor the New Republic forces, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Apwar Trigit]] escaped from the ''Implacable'' by flying his personal [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptor]] out of the engagement. Trigit left instructions not to surrender and the captain was left in charge of the dying ship. He followed the Admiral's order by rejecting [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles's]] offer to break off hostilities where both sides would retreat. The captain was determined to fight on and kill as many New Republic personnel despite [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel's]]&mdash;leader of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire's]] famed [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends|181st Imperial Fighter Wing]]&mdash;recommendation to accept the offer. The captain proceeded to remind the [[Ace/Legends|ace]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] that he was not in charge and merely an observer when he was shot by Fel, who then took over command of the ship and accepted Antilles's offer.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIt is not known if the captain survived the [[Battle of Ession]] after being shot by Soontir Fel, as there was no indication whether the [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] Fel used was set to [[Stun/Legends|stun]] or not.\n\nThe man who shot him was actually [[holostar]] [[Tetran Cowall]] in disguise as Fel as part of Zsinj's plan to trap [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Zsinj's empire]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Imperial personnel]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
