Shee had been hired during Farnmir's pursuit of the [[Zealots of Psusan/Legends|Zealots of Psusan's]] corrupt leader, [[Scri Oscuro]].\n\nAt one point, Shee was contacted by members of the Zealots of Psusan and was offered a hefty payout in exchange for selling out her partner.

Later, during the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] reign, Farnmir would [[Death/Legends|kill]] Shee for her betrayal, besting her in single combat on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Joining with Farnmir===\nCian Shee, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], was a skilled slicer who, at a point prior to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]' [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|outbreak]], was hired by the [[Kuati/Legends|Kuati]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Kalyn Farnmir/Legends|Kalyn Farnmir]], who had been discharged from the [[Kuati Security Forces]]. The duo enjoyed some success rooting out small-time criminals and corporate thieves. One such criminal was [[Scri Oscuro]], the [[High Priest (Psusan)|High Priest]] of the [[Zealots of Psusan/Legends|Zealots of Psusan]], who was using the church as a front for illicit activities.<ref name=\"db farnmir\" />\n\n===Betraying her partner===\n[[File:SineadOConnorInSpace-AotC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Farnmir and Shee embrace at the Outlander Club]]\nSome time after their takedown of Oscuro, Shee was contacted by members of the Zealots of Psusan, and offered a hefty payout if she were to sell out her partner, Farnmir. An informant also told Farnmir what the Zealots were planning, and that Shee was in on the plot. Farnmir then contacted Shee and organized a meeting at the [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]], a nightclub located in [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] [[Uscru Entertainment District/Legends|Uscru Entertainment District]]<ref name=\"db farnmir\" />\n\nThis meeting took place the same night that [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] were in [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|pursuit]] of [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]], after her attempted [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Farnmir arrived at the club first, and interrogated the Zealot of Psusan [[Nyrat Agira]], who confirmed the High Priest was on Coruscant and Shee had met with him. Farnmir and Shee met, Farnmir acting as if nothing was wrong, embracing her friend.<ref name=\"db farnmir\" />\n\nThe two witnessed Kenobi and Skywalker apprehending Wesell, and as the two left the club, Farnmir attempted to pin Shee before Shee could attack her first, but Shee avoided and fled into the Coruscanti night. Shee called off the deal with Oscuro, now aware that Farnmir was expecting an ambush.<ref name=\"db farnmir\" />\n\n===Work under the Empire and death===\nShee was still active at the time of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]],<ref name=\"db farnmir\" /> and also by the time the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] was founded, in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]].<ref name=\"TFU\" /> Shee took up Imperial contracts as a slicer, while her former companion Farnmir aided the Rebellion.
