Anybody? Help! Laigreks are everywhere! Help me, I'm trapped in here!|Jorran|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Jorran''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] living on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3951 BBY]]. As a [[Scavenger/Legends|scavenger]], he was one of the many that worked out of a [[Salvager camp|camp]] near the ruins of the [[Jedi Enclave]] on Dantooine. During that [[Time/Legends|time]], he was part of one of the salvager groups that had decided to brave the dangers of the Enclave's sub-level. The group quickly came under attack by a predatory insect known as [[laigrek]]s and were forced to retreat. Separated from the group and surrounded by laigreks, Jorran was forced to lock himself in a nearby room. When [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], searched the sub-level looking for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vrook Lamar]], she discovered Jorran. Surik [[Death/Legends|killed]] the laigreks barring Jorran's escape and allowed him to leave the Enclave's sub-level. When Surik returned to the salvager camp, Jorran thanked her and offered to sell her some of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] artifacts he had found. Jorran later joined the [[Khoonda Militia]] during the [[Battle of Khoonda]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I'm feeling much better now, thanks to you. I don't think I thanked you properly down there. I was pretty shaken. I really hope the Jedi salvage you bought was worth it. I meant what I said about no returns, though.|Jorran|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Jorran lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> A [[Scavenger/Legends|scavenger]] by trade, he worked out of a [[salvager camp]] established near the ruined [[Jedi Enclave]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. During that [[Time/Legends|time]], he stole a [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporator modulator]] from a [[Farmer/Legends|farmer]] named [[Suulru]]. Later, he was part of a salvage group led by a Human named [[Taepalae]] that had decided to brave the dangers of the Enclave's sub-level in the hopes of finding some highly valuable salvage. While within the dank lower level, they came under attack from the [[laigrek]]s, a predatory insect that inhabited the area. As the group fled from the laigreks, Jorran was separated from the group in the ensuing retreat and was forced to lock himself in a nearby room in order to protect himself from the vicious laigreks.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nWhen [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] otherwise known as the Jedi Exile, visited the sub-level in her search for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vrook Lamar]], she discovered Jorran in his hiding place. Jorran refused to unlock the door unless Surik [[Death/Legends|killed]] all the laigreks that were around which the former Jedi proceeded to do. She returned to Jorran and assured him that the beasts were no more. Jorran opened the door, thanked his rescuer, and explained to Surik what had happened and asked if he was free to go, which Surik allowed him to do so. She later returned to the camp and spoke with Jorran, who again thanked his rescuer and mentioned that he had found some [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] salvage in the sub-level. He offered to sell it to her for {{Cr}}1300. Back in the salvager camp he thanked her and offered his loot for {{Cr}}1000. Surik was also able to convince Jorran to return the moisture vaporator modulator to Suulru. Jorran would later be convinced by the Exile to join the [[Khoonda Militia]] to assist in the defense of [[Khoonda]], the planetary capital at the time, during the [[Battle of Khoonda]] between the residents of Dantooine and a group of [[Azkul's mercenaries|mercenaries]] led by [[Azkul]], a [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith]] veteran of the [[Jedi Civil War]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Did you find anything?''\"<br />\"''No, I didn't get anything. Now I'd just like to leave.''\"<br />\"''I just saved your life, I figure that's worth some honesty.''\"<br />\"''I guess you're right. I grabbed a couple of things in the room we were in. I didn't want to tell you because you might make a claim for it. I need the credits.|Meetra Surik and Jorran|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nAs a salvager and scavenger, Jorran split his time between searching the Enclave ruins for valuable items and attempting to sell these items to the Khoonda community. Jorran was greedy and would often attempt to get far more [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] for an item than it was worth and was known to steal items and equipment from the residents of Khoonda. He showed great gratitude to those that helped him. His [[Hair/Legends|hair]] was [[Color/Legends|grey]] with black streaks and he had blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJorran is a non-playable character who appears in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]]. He is one of the sources for a vital component needed by the player to construct their own lightsaber. Additionally, he is involved in a side quest involving the theft of a moisture vaporator modulator from a [[Farmer/Legends|farmer]] named [[Suulru]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n===Alternate outcomes===\nIt is possible to lie to Jorran about the laigreks being dead, causing him to open the door, run towards the exit and immediately be killed by one. This results in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points for the player. It is also possible to get him to admit to finding something valuable in the sub-level before he leaves, at which point you can kill him and loot the items from his corpse. This also results in dark side points. This can also be done to retrieve Suulru's moisture vaporator modulator. Alternatively, the player can offer to buy the items he admits to finding before allowing him to leave the sub-level.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nAdditionally, if you have [[G0-T0]] with you when you inquire about the salvage that Jorran wants to sell you, G0-T0 will make mention of a portion of the Khoonda Civil Code which allows you to sell Jorran into slavery and that he would fetch approximately {{Cr}}500 at auction. Jorran immediately lowers his offer by {{Cr}}500.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|As \"Jorran,\" \"Joran\"}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jorran\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Khoonda Militiamen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]"}}}]}}}}
