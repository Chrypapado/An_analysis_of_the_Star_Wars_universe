There, Bol worked on a secret project to develop [[pseudonet encryption]], which the Cartel considered to be of high importance. The technician's other duties at the base included tracking shipments of cargo, conducting inventory counts and descrambling things. Bol also maintained a personal log, saved on the Cartel base's [[Computer/Legends|computer]] network, which documented the technician's personal musings.<ref name=\"CA\" />\n\nFour [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after arriving on Tilnes, Bol wrote an entry in the technician's personal log lamenting Bol's [[Time/Legends|time]] at the base and commenting on how unpleasant the technician regarded being stuck in the secret facility below ground. The follow [[Standard day/Legends|day]], Bol listened to a speech by [[Thurm Loogg]],<ref name=\"CA\" /> the Metatheran Cartel's [[Envoy/Legends|envoy]] to the Cularin system,<ref name=\"LFCG\" /> which was broadcast via the [[Caarite holonet]], during which Loogg spoke of the Cartel's strength and prosperity. Two days later, Bol was instructed to prepare some [[bean juice]] for Ko Bas, the Cartel base's [[Overseer of Cartel Operations, Tilnes Special Detachment|overseer]]. Irked at being assigned such a menial task, Bol [[Water/Legends|spat]] in the [[Foodstuff/Legends|juice]] that the technician prepared for him. However, Bas detected the impurity in his drink via a purifier and Bol's pay was docked as a punishment. The technician was also threatened with being give the task of programming the base's [[bean juice boiler]] to detect the presence of impurities.<ref name=\"CA\" />\n\nFour days following the incident with the bean juice, a group of [[Human/Legends|Human]] allies of the Cartel called upon the base and their presence left Bol feeling unsettled. Just as Bol was writing of the visit in the Caarite technician's personal log, an explosion struck the base, the result of a [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]] detonated by the [[Believers]] [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] to disperse a [[Anti-Caarite virus|virus fatal to Caarites]] within the Cartel installation.<ref name=\"CA\" /> Bol subsequently contracted the contagion and was [[Death/Legends|killed]].<ref name=\"death\" />\n\n{{RPG|''[[Caaried Away]]''}}\nTwo [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the explosion, the [[heroes of Cularin]], a team of renowned freelance agents, ventured to the Cartel base to investigate a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress signal]] originating from the facility.

Bol detested how the Cartel base on the moon operated in secret deep underground, believing this to be unnatural and that it would be better if the Cartel instead conducted business more openly in the Cularin system.

However, Bol resolved to take more care in the future to avoid getting into trouble again. Bol felt uneasy when outsiders visited the Tilnes facility because the technician judged that the people of the Cularin system disliked the Cartel and therefore contact with the other residents of the [[Star system/Legends|star system]] negatively impacted morale of the base's staff.<ref name=\"CA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCelis Bol was mentioned in ''[[Caaried Away]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure by [[Morrie Mullins]] set within [[Star Wars Legends]] continuity that was released in [[March]] [[2003]].
