'The agreed-to we do at once. The inevitable can take a little while.'|Dracmus, patiently trying to unite [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]] against the [[Overden]] and the [[Sacorrian Triad]]|Showdown at Centerpoint}}\n'''Dracmus''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] and a member of the [[Hunchuzuc Den]] living on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. As with all Selonians, she was bred for a single task, which in her case was negotiating with [[Alien/Legends|alien]] races. By Selonian standards, she was well acquainted with foreign customs, but her understanding of [[Human/Legends|Human]] society was still flawed. She was pivotal in ending the [[Corellian Crisis|Corellian Insurrection]], as she dealt with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] during the crisis in [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early conflicts===\n{{Quote|Glad I did not kill you in the fight.''\"<br />\"''The pleasure is all mine.|Dracmus and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]|Assault at Selonia}}\nDuring the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]], the [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] Dracmus was captured by [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], the leader of the [[Human League]]. She gave him a promise that she would not attempt to escape, and as Selonians could not easily break their promises, Thrackan trusted her. He allowed her to be removed from her cell and fight his cousin [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. However, Han was familiar with [[Mandaba]], the Seloian language, and was able to convince Dracmus to go easy on him during the fight without Thrackan catching on. Though he was battered and knocked unconscious, he won Dracmus's trust. The two were placed in the same cell following the battle, to the amusement of Thrackan. The two talked about the massive [[Interdiction field/Legends|interdiction field]] that prevented anyone from leaving or entering the Corellian System in [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], and possible escape plans. When the [[Hunchuzuc Den]] staged a rescue by digging through the floor, Solo was allowed to come along.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\n[[File:Selonian.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] battles Dracmus]]\n\nDracmus and Solo then traveled deep into the [[Selonian Tunnels]] under [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], into areas which Dracmus acknowledged no non-Selonian had ever seen. The two crawled through the tunnels for days, eventually boarding a primitive [[Selonian cone ship]] to take them to Selonia. Dracmus revealed to Solo that the Hunchuzuc Den was one of a handful of rebel clans fighting against the Selonian [[Overden]], which sought independence from the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. The Overden and the Hunchuzuc Den were involved in a dispute that was part military confrontation, part debate, and part public relations.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nThe two were joined by [[Salculd]], who piloted the Selonian vessel. The coneship traveled through the system to Selonia, where they encountered the ship ''[[Jade's Fire]]'', piloted by [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] and [[Leia Organa Solo]], Han's wife. However, they also were met by Overden [[LAF-250 starfighter]]s. The coneship, outdated and lacking any weapons of sufficient shields, was severely damaged. Thanks to Han's mechanical genius, they managed to survive a controlled crash. Once on the planet, the [[Human/Legends|Humans]] learned that the Overden had discovered the all-important planetary repulsor, giving them victory. Dracmus attempted to negotiate with the Overden. The key representative for the Overden was a female by the name of [[Kleyvits]]. However, as her side had control of the repulsor, Kleyvits was in a position to make demands&mdash;specifically, Selonian independence.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\n===Revelations===\nThe three Humans were kept as captives and questioned for a time, but together they reasoned that the Overden must have had outside help to control the repulsor. During one of their interrogations, Han questioned Kleyvits about who was operating the repulsor. Kleyvits was unable to answer, to the shock of Dracmus, who seized upon the opportunity and demanded to know. Kleyvits revealed that her allies were the Selonians of the [[Sacorrian Triad]], who had been exiled generations ago. The fact that the exiles were helping completely destroyed the Overden's credibility and shifted the balance of power. Dracmus now had the upper hand, as the Sacorrian Selonians had been utterly dishonored among their exile, and it was a shame to be associated with them.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|Battle of Centerpoint Station]] a short time later, Dracmus was in heated negotiations with the Selonians of the Triad, another delicate public relations battle, to persuade them to hand over control of the Selonian repulsor. However, the process was too slow, prompting the trader Mara Jade to make a suggestion: a bribe. With a hefty bribe, she was able to convince the Selonians to part with the instructions for the repulsor, allowing young [[Anakin Solo]] and a team of Bakuran engineers to fire the planetary repulsor on [[Drall (planet)|Drall]] and prevent [[Centerpoint Station]] from destroying another star. The Triad, Overden, and their ally Thrackan had lost. Corellia remained a part of the New Republic, thanks to the Solos, Luke Skywalker, [[Gaeriel Captison]] and the Bakuran fleet and Dracmus.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Have you ever given a straight answer in your life?''\"<br />\"''What, exactly, are you meaning by straight answer?|Han Solo and Dracmus|Showdown at Centerpoint}}\nDracmus was a kind individual who cared greatly about her Den, and who wanted to help the New Republic. She hated Thrackan Sal-Solo for the crimes he committed, and helped his cousin, Han Solo, as he was not cruel like Thrackan. Despite the fact that she was trained to deal with Humans, she did not understand many Human ideas or values, such as how cousins could be so different, as Selonians in a Den were similar to \"hive-minded\" individuals like the [[Taurill/Legends|Taurill]]. She took many Human expressions literally, such as when told to \"keep her shirt on\", she questioned Han what shirt she should wear, and why. Dracmus also followed orders striclty, refusing to answer any questions from Han when she was told to reveal nothing of importance to him. Still, she did her best to help Han Solo, and showed her caring nature when she allowed him to come with her when her Den rescued her from Thrackan's clutches. Like all Selonians she cared about her family, but did not mourn when one of her sisters died, as she had hundreds, something Humans found odd.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDracmus appeared in ''[[Assault at Selonia]]'', the second book of ''[[Star Wars: The Corellian Trilogy]]'', and the final book of the series, ''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''.
