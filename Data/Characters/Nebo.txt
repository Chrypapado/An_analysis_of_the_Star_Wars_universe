Nebo delivered sermons to the Iziz populace alongside his father, [[Rask]], despite the fact that their rhetoric was highly unpopular with their audience, who were happy to be free of the former Naddist monarchy of Onderon. During one such sermon in [[3997 BBY]], a large angry mob began hurling projectiles at Nebo and Rask, but the two Naddists were saved by a lone [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]]. Despite their confusion at a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] protecting followers of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Kun enlisted the two Naddists to help him reach the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] of the [[Death/Legends|dead]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]]. Nebo, along with his father, guided the Jedi to the mausoleum on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]] and watched as Kun cut a hole in the tomb's outer wall with his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] in order to enter. Thinking him a tomb desecrator, Nebo and Rask pulled [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] on Kun once he emerged from within the structure but [[Death/Legends|fell]] to Kun's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Come with me. I believe you two can help me.|Exar Kun, to Nebo and Rask|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 2}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], Nebo was a street philosopher who preached to the residents of the Onderonian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] alongside his father,<ref name=\"cswe\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> [[Rask]]. Nebo and his father were members of the [[Naddist]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]], which worshiped fallen [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]], who brought the teachings of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] to Onderon centuries before. However, by [[3997 BBY]], Onderon's Naddist [[Onderon Royal Family|monarchy]] had [[Second Battle of Onderon|fallen]], and the Naddists were seen as enemies by the populace of Iziz. Nevertheless, Nebo and Rask did not hide their allegiance to the darkside cult, even after the fall of the Naddist government.<ref name=\"darklords2\" /> Although Nebo and Rask's rhetoric was despised by the Onderonian masses, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] refused to arrest them, as they had not committed any crimes.<ref name=\"audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio drama]]</ref>\n\nOn one day in 3997 BBY, Nebo and his father took to the streets to preach the virtues of a Naddist-led government but were met only by an angry mob who insulted and cursed them. Before long, their audience began hurling rocks and other projectiles at Nebo and Rask, who were forced to cower and protect themselves from the mob. However, a lone Jedi Knight named [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] ignited his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and stepped between the preachers and the townsfolk, berating the crowd for not letting the Naddists speak. Nebo and Rask were incredulous and asked Kun why he, a Jedi Knight, would protect followers of Freedon Nadd. Kun responded that he needed help in something and that he believed Nebo and Rask could assist him.<ref name=\"darklords2\" />\n\nKun revealed that he was hoping to learn more about the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and closely interrogated Nebo and Rask on what they knew about the location of the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd]]. After a promise of [[Gold/Legends|gold]], Nebo and Rask agreed to transport Kun to [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] where Nadd's tomb was located. After landing a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] on the Onderonian moon, Nebo and Rask guided Kun to the site of the tomb. Kun asked the two to remain behind while he entered, promising them a great reward if the structure they had reached was in truth the tomb he sought. Nebo and Rask watched as Kun subsequently cut a hole in the structure's outer wall with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], in order to enter. When Kun returned, Nebo and Rask each pulled a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on the Jedi Knight, calling him a tomb desecrator and demanding that he hand over the [[Sith scroll/Legends|Sith scrolls]] he had gathered in the tomb. Enraged, Kun drew his lightsaber and [[Death/Legends|killed]] the father-and-son Naddist duo.<ref name=\"darklords2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Now that power has been ''taken'' from us by the hateful Jedi Knights. These meddlers have destroyed the ancient Onderonian society!|Nebo|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 2}}\nNebo was an ardent believer in the Naddist teachings, so much so that he continued to preach the virtues of a Naddist regime in the streets of Iziz despite the fact that their rhetoric had drawn the ire of the Onderonian populace. Both Nebo and his father despised the Jedi Knights, describing them as \"hateful\" and blaming them for the downfall of the Onderonian monarchy. Therefore, they were very surprised when the Jedi Exar Kun saved them from the angry mob and defended their right to free speech. Nebo held a measure of reverence toward Freedon Nadd's tomb, to the point where he pulled a blaster on Kun after the Jedi Knight, in Nebo's [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], desecrated the tomb. Both Nebo and his father showed a degree of knowledge of Dxun's terrain, successfully leading Kun through the moon's treacherous wilderness to Nadd's resting place.<ref name=\"darklords2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNebo made his first appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Kevin J.
