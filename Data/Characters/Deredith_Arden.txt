The planet [[Arden]] was named after him. He may have been the progenitor of the [[Captison family]]; it is implied that he may have been either the grandfather or great-grandfather of [[Dol Captison|Dol]] and [[Yeorg Captison]].\n\nAfter Arden's [[Death/Legends|death]], and faced with diminishing returns, the [[Bakur Mining Corporation]] faced an uncertain future; this may have been the factor that led to the power shift from the Corporation to the [[Bakuran Senate]].\n\nAll titular heads-of-government of Bakura, until at last the end of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] control in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], were descended from Arden.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] of [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]]\n|years=c.
