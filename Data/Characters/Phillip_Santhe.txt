His sibling perished during outbreaks of anti-Imperial violence on [[Lianna/Legends|Lianna]]. As the only surviving son of Lady Santhe, Phillip was the heir to the considerable Santhe fortune.\n\nHe was a supporter of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], believing a man such as [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] was required to restore order. Phillip was resentful of his mother for pushing him around and for not relinquishing control of the family company. He was an engineer and was heavily involved in the [[NOVA]] project, an imperial contract to improve a key component of a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]]. He hoped that successful completion of this project would hasten his mothers retirement.\n\nPhillip was a cold and calculating person who was able to manipulate most people except for Lady Santhe. He was not particularly intelligent and had a tendency to complain and whine. He was intimidated by the Imperial, Lord [[Rodin Hlian Verpalion]] who was assigned to oversee the NOVA Project.\n\nHe was the father of [[Kashan Santhe]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mission to Lianna]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santhe, Phillip}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire science and engineering personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lianns]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
