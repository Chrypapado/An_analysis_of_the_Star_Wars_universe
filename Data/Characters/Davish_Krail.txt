He also estimated that there were at least twenty [[XX-9 heavy turbolaser battery|turbolaser batteries]] along the trench and alerted both Vander and [[Dex Tiree]] to keep a lookout for any [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Shortly afterwards, they were attacked by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] himself and a pair of escort fighters. Despite Vander's warnings that they couldn't outmaneuver Vader and his escort, Krail encouraged him to stick to their target, but when Vander was [[Death|shot down]] by Vader, Krail was forced to abandon [[Gender|his]] trench run. In his last words, he attempted to warn [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] of the dangers that lay within the trench before Darth Vader destroyed his engine.
