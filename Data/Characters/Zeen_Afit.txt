He owned a freighter named [[Corona (freighter)|''Corona'']].\n\n==Biography==\nZeen, like many other smugglers, aided the fledgling [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in their [[Battle of Ylesia|fight]] on [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]]. Unlike Han and many others, he, along with [[Katya M'Buele]] were not cheated by the Rebels.\n\nHan later met up with Zeen on Skip One in the Run while investigating [[Kueller]]'s Senate Hall bombings in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]]. He joined Han and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] in their attempt to rescue [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] from the crime lord [[Nandreeson]], along with [[Kid DXo'ln]], [[Wynni]] and [[Ana Blue]]. Unknown to Han, Afit's true loyalty lay with Nandreeson. Once the rescue party reached the pool in Nandreeson's chamber, Afit turned on Han along with Kid and Wynni. At a command from Nandreeson, Afit joined Kid, Wynni and Nandreeson's guards in attempting to kill Solo, Calrissian and Chewbacca (Blue did not help either side in the ensuing struggle). Solo dived underwater to avoid the blaster fire and the fiery breath of the [[Glottalphib]] guards and pulled Afit down with him. Afit was caught unawares and had no opportunity to draw in a lungful of air before going under. After a desperate struggle with Solo he finally succumbed to lack of oxygen. Solo released his grip on Afit and made for the surface to help Lando and Chewbacca. The unconscious Afit sank toward the bottom of the pool, drowning to death moments later.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Rebellion]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zeen Afit\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Afit, Zeen}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
