The competition, which was launched in ''[[Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3]]'' ([[1995]]), called for readers to create and design totally new alien species' influenced and inspired by the [[original trilogy]] of ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. Lee, a 26-year-old fan, submitted his drawing of Scoth, which was not included in the winners published in ''[[Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7]]'' ([[1996]]), but was instead published as an \"honorable mention\" in ''[[Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 9]]''. [[Holocron continuity database]] keeper [[Leland Chee]] has since stated that successfully published \"Design an Alien\" materials are considered [[canon]].<ref name=\"tt\">{{SWBoards|url=message.jspa?messageID=14724917|thread=Holocron continuity database questions|user=[[Leland Chee|Leland Y Chee]]|date=May 3, 2006|time=5:45 PM|quote=Star Wars Galaxy Magazine #7 published the winners of the 'Design an Alien' contest, where fans were encouraged to submit artwork and backstories of new SW aliens.
