She performed missions investigating the origins of [[First Order]] Captain [[Phasma]] and establishing a Resistance base in the [[Black Spire Ruins]] on [[Batuu]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Ignite the Spark. Light the Fire.|Vi Moradi|Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge}}\n[[File:Amaka.png|thumb|left|175px|Vi Moradi, Resistance spy code named \"Starling\"]]\nVi Moradi, was a [[spy]] who served in the [[Resistance]] during the [[Cold War]]. At some point prior to the [[attack on Tuanul]] she and her droid, [[U5-GG]], were captured in their [[HH-87 Starhopper|starhopper]] and taken aboard the [[First Order]] [[battlecruiser]] ''[[Absolution]]''. Whilst aboard the [[Starship|ship]], she was interrogated for information about the past of [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] by [[Archex|Cardinal]], a rival of Phasma, in exchange for her release.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\nMoradi relayed all of the testimony she learned from [[Siv]], a former comrade of Phasma's from [[Parnassos]], about his rival, while in the meantime subtly prying information from Cardinal. In the end, when Cardinal demanded proof to accuse Phasma of [[Death|murdering]] [[General]] [[Brendol Hux]], Moradi provided him with a [[Parnassos beetle]], the means of which Phasma committed the deed. After Cardinal failed to bring the evidence to his superiors and later lost a duel against Phasma, Moradi rescued him and later traveled to Parnassos to rescue Siv as well as her daughter [[Torbi]].<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\nMoradi later visited [[Black Spire Outpost]] on [[Batuu]], where she would send a message to all Resistance sympathizers to join the remaining Resistance forces on Batuu to help in the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the Resistance and the First Order.<ref name=\"Vi's Message\">{{Youtube|ODhYLypTJ5A|Media Invite to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland|channel/UCFpI4b_m-449cePVasc2_8g|Attractions Magazine|archivedate=20190517021851}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RenChokesMoradi-SWGE.png|thumb|right|250px|Vi Moradi being interrogated by Kylo Ren]]\nMoradi met up with other Resistance members on Batuu where she was tasked with infiltrating the [[TIE/es assault shuttle|First Order shuttle]] in Black Spire Outpost to steal a [[datacard]] containing First Order fleet movements. While discussing the mission, the meeting was interrupted by two [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] who were quickly disarmed by [[Chewbacca]] and other Resistance operatives. Although the stormtroopers attempted to threaten that reinforcements were on the way, Moradi rightly pointed out that they hadn't been able to report in the location where they had found the Resistance operatives. While aboard the shuttle, she was forced to hide from  after being warned by Resistance sympathizers who distracted the troopers. After successfully stealing the datacard, she was able to hand it over to a [[pilot]] with [[Blue Squadron (Resistance)|Blue Squadron]]. Before she could return to base, she was confronted by [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] who demanded the location of General Organa and the Resistance Base. When she refused, Ren used the [[Force choke|Force]] against her and prepared to strike her down. Ren however was stopped by the arrival of [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], allowing Vi to move and engage a First Order Officer in combat which led to her escape. Vi then regrouped with the Resistance operatives and she was present when [[Blue Leader]] communicated with them stating that the Datacard had been successfully retrieved and en route to General Organa. Blue Leader then directed his thanks to Vi Moradi.<ref name=\"Kylo vs Rey Galaxy's Edge\">{{Youtube|video=UGUsYWmVV2I|text=Star Wars Lightsaber Battle and Stunt Show in Galaxy's Edge during media event &#124; Attractions Magazine|channel=Attractions Magazine|channelname=Attractions Magazine|archiveurl=https://archive.is/dlLEi}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Vi_Moradi-Batuu_Guide.jpg|Moradi evading stormtroopers in Black Spire Outpost|thumb|left|250px]]\nWhen Archex tried to kiss Moradi, she rebuffed his advance.
