An [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force|Outland Regions Security Force]], she fought in the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. In the wake of the war, Mme. Zsinj remained loyal to the new government, the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] led by [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], former [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic. Eventually, Zsinj rebelled against the Empire that had sidelined her, stealing the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Retaliation]]'' and becoming a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]]. She was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by her own son and former pupil, [[Zsinj]], who was eager to go up in the military hierarchy.\n\n==Biography==\nMaarisa Zsinj was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] to [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Parent/Legends|parents]] on [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], a [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], during the height of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. At some point in her youth, she [[Marriage/Legends|married]] [[Zsinj's father|a mechanic]] from [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]], and the two begat a son, [[Zsinj]]&mdash;who bore no first name, per the traditions of his father's culture. Mme. Maarisa Zsinj served as an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] in the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force|Outland Regions Security Force]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and her skills earned her the nickname of \"Ace of the Spacelanes.\" She acted as a mentor to her son, who served under her during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. When [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], then [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic, [[Declaration of a New Order|transformed]] the government into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] at the end of the conflict, the Zsinj remained loyal to him. Zsinj now served as an Imperial admiral, at the helm of the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class]] [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Retaliation]]''. However, as the [[Imperialization/Legends|Imperialization]] went by, female officers suffered discrimination, and Maarisa Zsinj was gradually relegated to second class duties. Eventually, the ''Retaliation'' was recalled for decommissioning, and her son volunteered to take command of it. Shocked by her own offspring's opportunism, Maarisa Zsinj refused to pass control of her ship. She decided to steal the ''Retaliation'' and start preying on government ships to fight what she saw as Imperial corruption. Because of that, Zsinj was now considered a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] by the Empire. Since he knew her tactics better than anyone else, her own son was tasked with defeating her, with the promise of obtaining the [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class]] Star Destroyer [[Iron Fist (Victory-class)|''Iron Fist'']], which had been slated for retirement. Although initially reluctant to commit [[Parricide|matricide]], the young Zsinj eventually put his emotions aside and entered a ferocious campaign that resulted in his mother's [[Death/Legends|death]]. Maarisa Zsinj's Imperial service record was erased and her past admiralty wiped out of existence. Years later, as he faced his own incoming demise in [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], audio recordings from [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|one]] of the enemy ships picked up what his final word was: \"Mama,\" echoing his very first.<ref name=\"Despoilers1\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-1|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 1}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Maarisa Zsinj\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zsinj, Maarisa}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire admirals and generals]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic admirals and generals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Judicial Forces officers]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
