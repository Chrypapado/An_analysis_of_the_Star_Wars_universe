Based in [[Lower Cuipernam]], his [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]] was [[Ogomoor]], his aide was [[Ib-Dunn]], he had two [[Yuzzem]] [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]], and at least four concubines: a [[Human/Legends|Human]], a [[Brogune]], and at least two of an unknown [[Species/Legends|species]].\n\n==Biography==\nAround 22 BBY, Soergg was hired by the [[Commerce Guild/Legends|Commerce Guilds]] and some other industrial interests, to execute a plot to withdraw Ansion from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]. The secession of Ansion would cause a number of planets allied with it to secede as well, dealing a serious blow to the Republic, and giving the Commerce Guilds and their associates the opportunity to create [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|a new government of their own design]].\n\nTo this end, Soergg first attempted to influence the political process on Ansion; then, when [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], [[Luminara Unduli/Legends|Luminara Unduli]] and [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] attempted to convince Ansion to remain in the Republic, he hired thugs to try to kill them several times. In the end, his attempts failed, but he murdered those with the evidence to incriminate him. Though publicly accused by Offee, his part in the conspiracy was never revealed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Approaching Storm]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Approaching Storm (audiobook)|''The Approaching Storm'' audiobook]]\n*{{Hnn|54|jediwatch/1352_1.html|Jedi Settle Ansion Dispute|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728120337/http://www.holonetnews.com/54/jediwatch/1352_1.html}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030918hutt|text=Hutt!
