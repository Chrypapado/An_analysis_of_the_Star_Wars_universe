During the reception he met [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and complimented her on her beauty.\n\nLater that evening, he was in his bedroom in the suite he shared with his father when he was awakened by the argument between his father and [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]]. When he came out of his room to see what the commotion was, he witnessed his father being shot and [[Death/Legends|killed]] by an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]], [[Jahan Cross]]. Organa quickly grabbed Bron and got him under cover for safety as security forces gave chase, intent on finding Bron's father's killer.<ref name=\"AotE-HT1\">''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of his father, Bron went with the other House Lords aboard the [[Windrunner/Legends|''Windrunner'']] to decide his fate. He then met Jahan Cross, whom he knew as Ambassador Cross's son.

He was pursued by Jorrick's guard and [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], until Fett fired a missile at his shuttle, appearing to kill Bron.\n\nIn reality, though, Bron had been taken to Alderaan to be raised by Bail Organa until he took his title and position as Serenno's regent if he wanted to.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhile Bron Dooku's eye color was blue throughout ''[[Star Wars: Agent of the Empire\u2014Hard Targets]]'', the cover of the series' [[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 5|''Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets'' 5]] had them brown.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Bron Dooku}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 2]]''\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 3]]''\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 4]]''\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 5]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Bron Dooku\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dooku, Bron}}\n[[Category:House of Dooku]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Serennian]]"}}}]}}}}
