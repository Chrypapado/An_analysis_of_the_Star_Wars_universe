Toruna was one of a group of couriers who were sent by Vex to transport an illicit shipment. However, they were attacked by a group of thugs that were working for [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] and were all killed. Toruna was able to cheat [[Death/Legends|death]] and was replaced by a [[timeshadow]] of himself.\n\nWhen Vex finally found Toruna, he was furious with him for the loss of the shipment and had his [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] enforcer [[Raptor (Trandoshan)|Raptor]] beat up the Twi'lek. Toruna explained what had happened and Vex claimed to believe Toruna's tale of how he had died. However, to prove if Toruna was telling the truth, Vex had Raptor shoot Toruna. There was no timeshadow this time and the shot killed the unfortunate Twi'lek.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050811timeaftertime|text=Time After Time|int=Time After Time|archivedate=20090603045432}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toruna, Gust}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
