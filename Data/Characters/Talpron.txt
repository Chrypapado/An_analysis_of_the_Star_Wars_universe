He led [[Squadron Two (Corellian Defense Forces Space Service)|Squadron Two]] at the time of the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]], in which the CDF space forces joined with the insurgents, while the CDF ground forces formed a loyalist faction. Talpron participated in an elaborate ruse designed to project an image of trustworthiness on the part of the CDF, in which a staged attack upon the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] by [[Ugly/Legends|Uglies]], purported to be space pirates, was to be thwarted by CDF [[Pocket Patrol Boat]]s. The ruse went awry when [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] came out of hyperspace ahead of the designated coordinates.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Ambush at Corellia]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Talpron\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Defense Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
