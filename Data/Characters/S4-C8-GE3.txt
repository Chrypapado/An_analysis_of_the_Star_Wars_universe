I am not a good player. Quite the mark, as it were.|[[Atton Rand]] and S4-C8|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''S4-C8-GE3''' was a [[GE3-series protocol droid]] with [[Gender/Legends|feminine programming]] in [[3951 BBY]]. She had what appeared to be a personality quirk: an obsession for [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]]. She was a regular at the [[Pazaak Den]] next to the [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] [[Refugee Sector]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. One reason she was so popular was because, despite having a passion for the game, she was very bad at it, and would often lose large sums of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] on wagers.\n\nBy chance, S4 met [[Meetra Surik]], who was looking to draw out the infamous [[The Champ|Champ]]. However Surik became suspicious of her personality quirk, and discovered that the supposed faulty programming that had compelled S4 to come to the cantina and play, was in fact a cleverly disguised routine for gathering sensitive information by remote. To further her goals, Surik fixed the programming and S4 lost interest in the game.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nS4-C8's first and only appearance was [[Obsidian Entertainment]]'s [[2004]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' video game. She is the only known GE3\u2013series protocol droid with feminine programming.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=S4-C8-GE3\n}}\n\n[[Category:Droids with feminine programming]]\n[[Category:GE3-series protocol droids]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
