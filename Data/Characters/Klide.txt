He arrived on Cularin in about [[34 BBY/Legends|34 BBY]], to study a mural in [[Jax Warehouse]]. He was off-world when the [[Cularin system]] [[Cularin's disappearance|disappeared]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] and he returned to Cularin after it reappeared in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. He continued to study the mural and following the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], became acquainted with [[Lora Nadad]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who was hiding out in the warehouse.\n\nEventually Klide figured out the meaning of the mural, realizing that it gave the co-ordinates for the location of an ancient artifact, the [[Eye of the Sun]]. However, shortly afterwards, he was approached by [[Len Markus]], who took Klide's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]], which contained details of all of his research.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Eye]]''\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
