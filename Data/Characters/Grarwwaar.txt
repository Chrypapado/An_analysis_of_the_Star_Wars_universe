Rulan managed to separate Grarwwaar from his party and brutally killed him, assuming the Wookiee's identity for himself. However, another Wookiee who had knew that the real Grarwwaar was dead had mentioned this in a datapad, effectively exposing the secret to anyone who was looking for Rulan.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGrarwwaar only appears if the player takes the dark side option of killing Rulan Prolik for [[Hulas]] as part of the [[GenoHaradan]] quest series. Rulan will say that Grarwwaar was attempting to hide in the Shadowlands away from Humans.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
