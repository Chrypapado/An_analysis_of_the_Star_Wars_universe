In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], she was teamed as junior partner to [[Shada D'ukal]], serving alongside her as co-pilot and gunner of ''[[The Fury]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nDunc shared [[Shada D'ukal|Shada's]] air of professional competence and carried a similar arsenal of personal weaponry, including several [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblades]] and [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], but she seemed less battle-hardened, and still believed that the [[Mistryl Shadow Guard|Shadow Guard]] were more than mercenaries, although her air of youthful idealism was perhaps emphasized by her fair complexion and delicate features.\n\nAt around the time that [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] abducted [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]], ''[[The Fury]]'' was contracted for 20,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to transport [[Fenig Nabon]] and [[Ghitsa Dogder]] with a cargo from [[Leb'Reen]] on [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. Dunc expected the cargo to be [[ryll kor]] for medical use, and was horrified to discover that it was actually a troupe of [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] dancers indentured to the [[Clan Shak|Shak clan]], being sold into virtual slavery to [[Durga Besadii Tai|Durga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].\n\nThroughout the voyage, Dunc was continually baited by Ghitsa, and the situation was not improved when the [[Karazak Slavers Cooperative]] ship ''[[Indenture]]'' tried to attack ''The Fury'' and appropriate their living cargo. Shada and Dunc decided to liberate the slaves, and unceremoniously offloaded Fenig and Ghitsa in an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]]&mdash;only to discover that that had been the plan all along, and they had been unwittingly manipulated into aiding their passengers in a complex con.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Dunc T'racen is based on noted fan [[Tracy Duncan]], whom authors [[Tish Eggleston Pahl|Tish Pahl]] and [[Chris Cassidy]] knew as the web administrator of Club Jade.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hutt and Seek]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dunc T'racen\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T'racen, Dunc}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]"}}}]}}}}
