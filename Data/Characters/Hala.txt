She was the mother of [[Amee/Legends|Amee]], a close friend of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], and was owned by [[Yor Millto]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter being taken in a slave raid by the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Krayn]], Hala showed defiance to the slavelord, who, because of that defiance, murdered her and took a small silver-bell necklace off her body to wear as a trophy. Anakin would later recognize this bell when he himself was taken by Krayn as a prisoner-slave in [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]]; that the crime-lord wore the trinket on his belt betrayed the grave meaning behind it, and it enraged the boy.\n\nHala was avenged by Skywalker when he confronted Krayn in battle as he fled the rebellious uprising of his own slaves: the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] impaled the pirate with his recently constructed [[Anakin Skywalker's first lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHala's bell, as depicted in the ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Quest (comic series)|Jedi Quest]] ''comics, was ''gold'', not the original ''silver'' bell that appears in [[Jude Watson]]'s ''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' story. But the comics' permutation of the bell is made to equate with the bell of Anakin's [[Ilum/Legends|Ilum]] temple [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] before he crafts his [[Anakin Skywalker's first lightsaber/Legends|first lightsaber]]: the same gold bell that Hala is seen to wear about her neck in the comics is the bell of Skywalker's [[Crystal Caves]] vision (an incident that appears in both story renditions)\u2014the bell that musically and pleasingly sounds, rolls toward and stops at the Padawan's feet, and pours forth blood, which spills over the boy's boots. Interestingly, the comics' main image of Hala wearing a glinting bell around her neck is rendered, it seems, in tones that suggest blood-red.<ref>''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]''</ref><ref>''[[Star Wars: Jedi Quest (comic series)]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Jedi Quest 2|''Jedi Quest'' 2]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Jedi Quest 3|''Jedi Quest'' 3]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|55|KRA1, ''Krayn''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hala\n|nl=Hala\n|pl=Hala\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
