She served as assistant to [[Diktat]] [[Daclif Gallamby]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Brantlee Spondoon, the aide to the Diktat, has personally requested your assistance. You've been summoned to go speak with Brantlee. How exciting!|[[Gallura Handerin]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Brantlee Spondoon worked in the [[Coronet Capitol|Capitol building]] of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] as the aide to the [[Diktat]] [[Daclif Gallamby]].<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Brantlee Spondoon received word from an informant about a plot in motion to discredit the Diktat and his administration. She thus recruited a spacer who had previously worked for the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] government with [[Gallura Handerin]]. She tasked the spacer to meet with the  informant in a [[Warehouse (Coronet City)|warehouse]] in Coronet. However, when the spacer arrived in the warehouse, the informant was assassinated by a group of criminals made of former members of the [[Corellian Security Force]], the [[Rogue CorSec]]. The spacer tried to recover the informant's hidden datadisk but was unable to do so. The spacer then reported the situation to Spondoon who was very disappointed and worried that the information was lost. Brantlee Spondoon ignored that the spacer was in fact working for CorSec [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper]].<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" /> Jasper and the spacer decided to investigate the Rogue CorSec,<ref name=\"SWG:FowtRCAD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Find out what the Rogue CorSec Are Doing|Corellia}}</ref> and were finally able to foil the plot against the Diktat.<ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Receive the Thanks of a Grateful Diktat|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBrantlee Spondoon was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nBrantlee Spondoon and Daclif Gallamby were present in the original release of the game. Like most quest giver NPCs in the earliest versions of the game, they proposed \"minor quests\" to the players. These quests did not provide any experience and just consisted in moving to a random location in order to kill or protect one or several NPCs.<ref name=\"SWG\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref> These minor quests were removed from the game with the release of the expansion ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan]]'', on [[November 1]], [[2005]], since both characters were included in a new story arc, i.e., the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat.<ref name=\"SWG:ToOW\">{{SWG|Trials of Obi-Wan}}</ref> This questline was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 27 Notes for February 15th, 2006|Publish 27]]\", on [[February 15]], [[2006]],<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 27|archivedate=20060217101736}}</ref> as the story arc was inserted into the \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]]\", the main questline in the game.<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" /><ref name=\"SWG:FowtRCAD\" /><ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|Trials of Obi-Wan}}\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Brantlee Spondoon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spondoon, Brantlee}}\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
