In [[3997 BBY]], a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]&ndash;worshiping organization known as the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], led by royal heirs [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]] and [[Aleema Keto]], [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|overthrew]] the [[Tetan Monarchy]] and took control of the [[Star system/Legends|system]]. Farng and a number of fellow carbonite traders refused to bow to the Krath's rule and started a [[Empress Teta resistance|resistance group]]; however, Farng was discovered and captured, and was sentenced to be [[Death/Legends|killed]] during a Krath public execution ceremony. On the day that Farng was to be killed, Aleema Keto offered him a chance to change his mind and obey the Krath, but Farng refused, and the [[darksider]] prepared to execute him. Suddenly, an onlooker tossed Farng a [[Knife/Legends|knife]], and Farng leaped at Keto while members of the resistance revealed themselves and started fighting Krath security. Knife in hand, Farng nearly reached the Krath leader, but [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], on a mission to infiltrate the Krath, emerged from the crowd and killed the carbonite trader with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|And now you, ''Farng''&hellip; you're a smart trader. Do ''you'' want one ''last'' chance to obey the Krath?|Aleema Keto|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 4}}\n[[File:Farng.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Farng stands on a Tetan repulsordisk, awaiting his execution.]]\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]], Farng worked as a [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] [[Merchant/Legends|trader]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] prior to the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. Farng also served as the leader of the [[Carbonite Miners' Union]].<ref name=\"audio\" /> During these [[Time/Legends|times]], the [[Carbonite Guild]] wielded a heavy amount of influence in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]], and the [[King/Legends|monarchs]] of the [[Star system/Legends|system]], [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Keto]] and his sister, [[Magda Keto]], were forced to share their power with the organization. But, in [[3997 BBY]], a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]&ndash;wielding group known as the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], led by royal heirs [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]] and [[Aleema Keto]], [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|overthrew]] the [[Tetan Monarchy]]. Under Krath rule, all opposed were persecuted and usually [[Death/Legends|killed]] in public execution ceremonies. However, not all the inhabitants of the system bowed to their will; a [[Empress Teta resistance|group]] of local carbonite traders, including Farng, decided to resist the Krath regime. Eventually, Farng was captured and sentenced to be killed in an upcoming Krath public execution. The Krath's preferred method of death was to have their [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] stand on a [[Tetan repulsordisk]] situated high above a [[Carbonite drilling machine]], followed by Aleema Keto frightening their captive with a dark side [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|illusion]], causing them to lose their balance and fall into the drilling machine. Farng was to be executed in this manner.<ref name=\"darklords4\" />\n\nWhen it was Farng's time to be executed, Aleema Keto offered him one last chance to obey the Krath and save himself, but Farng refused, saying that he would rather die than capitulate to the Krath's rule. With Farng's fate seemingly sealed, the sorceress prepared to kill him. At that moment, an onlooker threw Farng a [[Knife/Legends|knife]], proclaiming that the Krath regime would die instead. Freeing himself from his shackles, Farng leapt toward Keto, while other members of the resistance revealed themselves and drew their weapons. Farng, knife in hand, nearly reached the Krath ruler. However, [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Krath and learn their dark secrets, emerged from the crowd and killed the carbonite trader with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. With Farng dead, the rest of the mob was subdued by Krath security forces.<ref name=\"darklords4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The ''carbonite miners'' declare their ''freedom! Death to dark side tyrants!''<nowiki></nowiki>|Farng|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 4}}\nFarng was very opposed to the Krath regime and was bold enough to try and [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] the leader of the organization, Aleema Keto. He was very committed to his beliefs, so much so that he refused to capitulate to the Krath's rule, even on consequence of death. Farng knew how to handle a knife in combat and was agile enough to be able to leap from his Tetan repulsordisk to Aleema Keto's perch several [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] away.<ref name=\"darklords4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFarng first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Kevin J.
