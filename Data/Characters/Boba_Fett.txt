Like my father before me.|Boba Fett|Chapter 14: The Tragedy}}\n'''Boba Fett''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[bounty hunter]] whose career spanned [[Standard decade|decades]], from the [[Republic Era|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] to the [[Battle of Endor|end]] of the [[Imperial Era|rule]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], culminating in his [[Attack on Jabba's Palace (Boba Fett)|ascension]] to [[crime lord]] of [[Tatooine]] during the [[New Republic Era|era]] of the [[New Republic]]. Originally code-named '''Alpha''', he was an unaltered [[Cloning|clone]] of the famed [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]]. Boba emulated his [[Parent|father]] and [[Gene|genetic]] [[Clone template|donor]] by wearing a [[Boba Fett's armor|customized suit]] of [[Mandalorian armor]]. His personal [[starship]] was the ''[[Slave I]]'', a [[Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft|''Firespray-31''-class patrol and attack craft]] that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared [[bounty]] hunters in [[the galaxy]] during the reign of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. He became a legend over the course of his career, which included contracts for both the Empire and the extensive criminal underworld.\n\nBoba was created on the [[planet]] [[Kamino]] as a result of an arrangement between the [[Sith Lord]] [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]] and Jango Fett, a Mandalorian [[foundling]] who served as the template of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Unlike the [[clone trooper]]s grown from Jango's [[DNA]], Jango regarded Boba as his son. During the last [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Separatist Crisis]], Boba and Jango retreated to [[Geonosis]] where the latter was [[Death|killed]] in [[First Battle of Geonosis|battle]] by [[Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]]. Orphaned by Jango's death, Boba sought vengeance by attempting to assassinate Windu, although his [[Sabotage of the Endurance|plan]] proved unsuccessful. After serving [[time]] in [[prison]] on [[Coruscant]], Fett took up his late father's profession as a bounty hunter, working alongside other [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], [[Dengar]], and [[Asajj Ventress]].\n\nIn the [[Proclamation of the New Order|aftermath]] of the [[Clone Wars]], Fett continued to make a name for himself while working for the [[Hutt]] [[gangster]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] as well as the [[Sith]] [[Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], Fett transported [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] from [[Bespin]] to [[Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine. Later, Fett stopped on the [[moon]] of [[Nar Shaddaa]] in order to make sure Solo would survive his time in carbonite, but he lost Solo while he was away as part of the return of the [[Crimson Dawn]], kicking off a war between bounty hunters for Solo. Ultimately, Fett regained Solo and delivered him to Jabba.\n\nHe tried to prevent Solo's [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], only to fall into the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] when Solo accidentally slammed a pole into Fett's [[jetpack]]. Although Fett survived his ordeal with the man-eating [[sarlacc]], his [[armor]] was sold to [[Cobb Vanth]] by [[Jawa]] [[scavenger]]s. He eventually regained it by tracking down and confronting the Mandalorian [[Mandalorian warrior|warrior]] [[Din Djarin]] on [[Tython]], who took Fett's armor from Vanth. After helping Djarin to [[Second rescue of Grogu|rescue]] the foundling [[Grogu]] from the crutches of [[Moff]] [[Gideon]], Fett returned to Tatooine where he killed [[Bib Fortuna]] and claimed the late Jabba's [[throne]] with [[Fennec Shand]] by his side.\n\n==Biography==\n===Creation and early life===\n{{Quote|Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.

When they all finally captured the Twi'lek girl on planet [[Ord Mantell]], Tiver and Rinn threatened to kill Boba, unless Fett gave up the Twi'lek girl. Eventually, Boba shot and killed Tiver and Rinn. Neelda complemented Boba afterward. Boba was soon about to kill Neelda but saw that he was not part of the Tiver and Rinn. Boba then let Neelda escape and run away. Fett and Boba later boarded their starship, ''Slave I'', with the Twi'lek girl to deliver her back to her father. As they traveled, Boba and his father discussed how he had preformed during the mission, with Jango believing Boba now had a great start to his legacy.<ref name=\"Age of Republic\">[[Age of Republic - Jango Fett 1|''Age of Republic - Jango Fett'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====Escape from Kamino====\n{{Quote|Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!|Boba, during his father's fight with Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n[[File:FettKenobiMeeting.png|thumb|left|250px|Boba and Jango meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.]]\nShortly before the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars]], Jango was sent on a mission to [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|assassinate]] [[Galactic Senate|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], an outspoken opponent of a potential war, at the behest of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Jango and his associate, [[Zam Wesell]], failed to kill the [[senator]], and Jango was [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|tracked]] to Kamino by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who knew a bounty hunter connected to Kamino was behind the attempt on Amidala's life. When Kenobi arrived on Kamino, the Kaminoans revealed the clone army to him, and Kenobi requested to meet Jango. [[Taun We]], an aide to [[Prime Minister]] [[Lama Su]], brought the [[Jedi]] Knight to the Fetts' quarters, where Boba greeted them. Despite being distrustful of the Jedi's presence, Boba allowed them to enter, where Kenobi spoke with Jango about the clones and implied he knew Jango was behind the assassination attempt. Knowing that he had been discovered, Jango and Boba immediately prepared to leave Kamino once Kenobi departed.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nWhile loading ''Slave I'' to leave, Kenobi discovered the Fetts attempting to flee and engaged Jango in one-on-one combat, fighting across the ship's landing platform. During the fight, Boba engaged the ship's blaster cannons and fired at Kenobi repeatedly in an attempt to kill him. As the fight progressed, Kenobi kicked Jango from the landing platform towards the ocean below, causing the Jedi&mdash;who was attached to the bounty hunter by a wire&mdash;to fall as well. Jango cut the wire and was able to make his way back up the platform, while Kenobi landed on the lower levels. This gave Jango enough time to reach the ship and leave as Boba piloted it, though Kenobi arrived on the platform again in time to attach a tracking device to its hull.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nJango and Boba made their way to [[Geonosis]], where the [[Executive Separatist Council|Separatist leaders]] had gathered. While en route, Kenobi caught up with them and engaged them in a [[Dogfight over Geonosis|firefight]] in the asteroid field surrounding Geonosis. The Fetts were able to evade the Jedi, and Jango shot a number of [[seismic charge]]s into space in an effort to destroy Kenobi's [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|starfighter]]. Kenobi was able to fake his ship's destruction by ejecting spare parts that exploded from a tracking missile, leading the Fetts to think he was dead. They proceeded to the planet's surface, while Kenobi remained hidden in the asteroid field before pursuing them.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Jango's death====\n{{Quote|Boba was on Geonosis when his father died. He watched as I killed him.''\"<br />\"''That would complicate things.''\"<br />\"''Indeed.|Jedi Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker|R2 Come Home}}\nShortly after the Fetts' arrival at Geonosis, Kenobi began investigating the Separatists on the planet and was captured by the [[Geonosian]]s. His capture prompted Senator Amidala and Kenobi's [[Padawan]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], to attempt a rescue of their friend. Jango and the Geonosians captured them, and all three detainees were brought into an execution arena, where Boba watched with his father from the sidelines as the detainees fought off the creatures that were meant to kill them. A [[Jedi assault team|team]] of Jedi, led by Master [[Mace Windu]], soon arrived to rescue them. Windu held [[Mace Windu's lightsaber|a]] [[lightsaber]] to Jango's throat while threatening [[Count]] Dooku, but Windu quickly left the stands for the [[Petranaki Arena|arena]] below as Separatist [[battle droid]]s began flooding the arena.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Vow_of_Vengeance_AtG.png|thumb|right|250px|Boba cradles his father's helmet, swearing vengeance against the Jedi who killed Jango.]]\nThe battle droids and Jedi [[First Battle of Geonosis|engaged]] one another in the arena. As the battle proceeded, Jango joined the fight, where the [[jetpack]] on his [[Mandalorian armor|armor]] was damaged and rendered inoperable, leaving him more vulnerable to attack. Despite the setback, Jango faced off against Windu, who beheaded and killed the bounty hunter. Boba watched in horror as his father was killed. Once the battle left the arena, Boba made his way into the cleared arena and took his father's helmet, pressing it against his head.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> After Jango's death, Boba fled Geonosis aboard ''Slave I'' and began plotting his revenge.<ref name=\"Complete Vehicles 2020\">''[[Star Wars Complete Vehicles, New Edition]]''</ref>\n\n===Clone Wars===\n====Quest for vengeance====\n{{Quote|We're brothers! Don't shoot!''\"<br />\"''You're ''not'' my brother.|A clone trooper and Boba Fett|Death Trap}}\nSometime later, Boba joined with a team of bounty hunters, including [[Aurra Sing]], [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], and [[Castas]] to carry out his revenge against Windu for Jango's death. Together, Boba and the bounty hunters crafted a plan to [[Sabotage of the Endurance|assassinate]] the Jedi Master aboard the Republic [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|vessel]] ''[[Endurance]]''. Boba posed as a young clone [[Clone cadet|cadet]], with the nickname Lucky, using the fact that he was genetically identical to the other young clones to his advantage; no one onboard ''Endurance'' was aware of his true identity. Once aboard the ''Endurance'', Boba and the other clones were greeted by Windu and Anakin Skywalker, before being put through tactical training. Each clone was able to engage in target practice, and they all missed their targets&mdash;except for Boba who was able to use the skills his father taught him to his advantage.<ref name=\"Death Trap\">{{TCW|Death Trap}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Epguide220.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boba poses as a young clone trooper on the ''Endurance''.]]\nLater, while on a tour of the ship, Boba slipped away from the other clones and found his way to Windu's quarters, where he quietly installed a bomb that would be triggered by a laser tripwire in the doorway. Windu did not enter his quarters, however, but a clone trooper did, killing the soldier in Windu's place and forcing the entire ship into alert status. Sing instructed Boba via [[comlink]] to sabotage the ''Endurance's'' reactor core, thereby killing everyone on the ship, but Boba was reluctant to kill everyone. His only goal was to kill Windu. Nonetheless, Boba did as instructed, sneaking away from his fellow clones once again, before being caught by a clone trooper who called for security. The two engaged in a brief scuffle near the core before Boba was able to stun the clone with the trooper's own blaster. He also shot at the core command console.<ref name=\"Death Trap\" />\n\nMuch of the hull was immediately destroyed in the ensuing explosion, while Windu and Skywalker were nearly sucked into space and killed before the hull breaches were sealed. With the ''Endurance'' critically damaged, the crew began to abandon ship. Boba, whose identity was not yet discovered, and the other young clones were sealed into an [[escape pod]] and jettisoned into space, but Boba sabotaged the pod in order to separate himself (and his fellow pod inhabitants) from the other escapees. The pod was intercepted by ''Slave I'', led by Sing and Bossk, which revealed Boba as the traitor who destroyed the ''Endurance''. Boba was given the choice to either stay with the clone cadets or leave with the bounty hunters, and Boba somewhat reluctantly chose to leave with the bounty hunters.<ref name=\"Death Trap\" />\n\n[[File:BobaBosskCastasSing-TCWS2E20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boba and the bounty hunters watch the explosion on the ''Endurance''.]]\nAfter leaving the escape pod, Boba and the other bounty hunters made their way to the nearby planet [[Vanqor]], where the ''Endurance'' had crashed after the explosion. Once there, they killed several clone troopers and captured Admiral [[Shoan Kilian]], the ship's commanding officer, as well as [[Clone Commander]] [[CT-411|Ponds]] and another officer. Hoping to set another trap for Windu, Boba rigged his father's old helmet as an explosive on the ship's [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]], which would be detonated if Windu came looking for any survivors. The Jedi Master, with Skywalker, [[Mission to Vanqor|arrived]] shortly thereafter. The helmet exploded just after Windu noticed it, and remembered that Jango had a son&mdash;deducing that Boba was the one attempting to kill him. Windu and Skywalker did not die in the ensuing explosion but were caught within the rubble of the quickly-deteriorating vessel.<ref name=\"R2 Come Home\">{{TCW|R2 Come Home}}</ref>\n\nAs Boba and the other bounty hunters watched the explosion, he assumed that Windu had been killed and wanted to recover his body. Some of his companions objected, however, believing that their three prisoners were already enough to earn a sizable fortune from Count Dooku if they were turned over to the Separatists, but Sing sided with Boba, and the team set out to find Windu's body. As they entered the ship, they encountered [[R2-D2]], Skywalker's personal [[astromech droid]], who attempted to slow their advance by throwing debris at them and closing doors in their path. Unable to make it to the bridge, Sing made the decision to use ''Slave I'' to destroy the remainder of the ''Endurance'', ensuring that Windu would perish.<ref name=\"R2 Come Home\" />\n\n[[File:Slave_I_Vanqor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Slave I'' pursues R2-D2, who pilots Windu's starfighter.]]\nBefore using ''Slave I'', the bounty hunters overheard an explosion caused by R2-D2, who had been attacked by [[gundark]]s and used one of the Jedi starfighters to kill a gundark. The bounty hunters believed that meant Windu had survived and jammed all communication, hoping to prevent the Jedi from requesting help. R2-D2 was able to escape in the other starfighter, however, and survived a brief firefight with ''Slave I'' before jumping to [[hyperspace]] for [[Coruscant]], where he successfully found help at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] and was able to bring a [[104th Battalion|team]] of Jedi and clones to rescue Windu and Skywalker. The bounty hunters, meanwhile, decided to use the hostages to lure Windu into a trap.<ref name=\"R2 Come Home\" />\n\n====Captured by the Jedi====\n{{Quote|I see now I've done terrible things. But you started this all when you murdered my father! I'll never forgive you.''\"<br />\"''Hmm. Well, you're going to have to. Take him away.|Boba Fett and Jedi Mace Windu|Lethal Trackdown}}\nSing took charge of setting the trap, and she sent a transmission to the Jedi Temple revealing that they were holding the Republic prisoners. Sing told Boba to personally execute Commander Ponds during the transmission, but he refused, as his goal was to kill Windu rather than other prisoners. Sing executed Ponds on her own, jettisoning him into space, and Boba's relationship with her and the other bounty hunters began to deteriorate. Boba objected to the treatment of the other prisoners as well, going so far as to show compassion by providing them with water. Nonetheless, the transmission to the Jedi Temple did end up putting the Jedi on their trail, only the Order sent Master [[Plo Koon]] and Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] rather than Master Windu.<ref name=\"Lethal Trackdown\">{{TCW|Lethal Trackdown}}</ref>\n\nThe group soon took refuge on [[Florrum]], where Sing planned to seek the assistance of [[Hondo Ohnaka]], a [[spice]] [[pirate]] and her former lover. Ohnaka was also a friend of Jango's, which Boba learned when Sing introduced them and when the pirate gave Boba his condolences for his father's death. Ohnaka declined to help her if the Jedi arrived on Florrum, but he also vowed not to stand in her way. Castas, however, contacted a [[Fong Do|fellow]] bounty hunter on Coruscant and offered to provide information on Boba and the others. Sing overheard his conversation and executed him, leaving Boba horrified as he began to realize he had made a mistake in teaming with the bounty hunters against Windu.<ref name=\"Lethal Trackdown\" />\n\n[[File:FlorrumStandoff-LT.png|thumb|right|250px|Boba, Sing, and the Jedi in a standoff on Florrum.]]\nDespite Castas' betrayal, it was his transmission to Coruscant that allowed the Jedi to discover Boba and the others on Florrum, as Tano had overheard the transmission. The two Jedi [[Second mission to Florrum|arrived]] on Florrum shortly thereafter, where Sing attempted to ransom the prisoners. Both sides ended up attacking one another, with Boba holding a blaster to Koon's head and Tano holding a [[Ahsoka's lightsabers|lightsaber]] to Sing's throat. The bounty hunters created a diversion and attempted to escape, but Boba was captured while Sing fled on a speeder. Koon interrogated Boba, who refused to disclose the location of the hostages despite his reservations about their treatment. Ohnaka was able to convince Boba to tell the Jedi, however, by saying that Jango would have wanted his son to do the honorable thing. The hostages were rescued, while Sing managed to make it to ''Slave I'' and begin to flee, but Tano clung to the ship and damaged it enough to cause a crash. The ship went down in a fiery explosion and the Jedi assumed Sing had been killed, but she survived.<ref name=\"Lethal Trackdown\" />\n\nBoba and Bossk, who was also taken into custody, were sent to Coruscant where they would be imprisoned. Windu met Boba upon his arrival, and Boba apologized for his actions and the destruction that he caused&mdash;but he vowed to never forgive Windu for killing his father.<ref name=\"Lethal Trackdown\" />\n\n====Becoming a bounty hunter====\n{{Quote|Boss?

During his time in prison, a Republic plan was put in motion aimed at preventing a suspected kidnapping plot against [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. To do so, Obi-Wan Kenobi faked his death and disguised himself as [[Rako Hardeen]], the suspect in the attempt on his life, and entered the same prison where Boba was being held. Kenobi teamed with [[Moralo Eval]], a suspect in the suspected kidnapping plot, and bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]] to escape the prison in the hopes it would lead him towards the heart of the conspiracy. As part of the escape attempt, Bane paid and encouraged Boba to confront \"Hardeen,\" and Boba claimed that Hardeen had cheated him out of a bounty. Boba and Kenobi briefly fought one another, before Bossk intervened and started a [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|riot]] to defend Boba.

Bane then asked to tell him the story, to which Boba replied that he hoped it would end with Bane repaying him the money he promised for creating the earlier distraction. After asking further about their cut of the deal, Bane revealed that \"Hardeen\" had not actually killed Kenobi, before going into the story of what transpired from Bane's perspective.

After [[Asajj Ventress]], a former [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] of Count Dooku who was betrayed by the Sith Lord and became a bounty hunter, killed one of their teammates, [[Oked]], Ventress was hired in his place. The team left Tatooine and proceeded to an [[Quarzite space station|orbital elevator station]] above Quarzite where they meet their employer, Major [[Rigosso]], and received the specifics of their assignment. The crew was to protect the contents of a chest, which would be delivered to the [[Otua Blank]], the ruler of Quarzite, via an underground tram, as the planet's atmosphere rendered delivery via spacecraft impossible. The chest needed protection from the band of [[Kage Warriors|raiders]], which was why the bounty hunters were hired.<ref name=\"Bounty\" />\n\nThe team embarked on their mission by taking the space elevator down beneath the surface of the planet, where they boarded the [[Subtram|tram]] and made their preparations to defend the chest from the raiders. The raiders boarded the tram during its journey and attacked, killing the Quarzite personnel. Most of the bounty hunters were thrown off of the tram. During the struggle against the raiders, Boba inadvertently knocked the chest over, revealing its contents: a young woman named [[Pluma Sodi]], who had been kidnapped so she could be married to Otua Blank against her will. The leader of the raiders, [[Krismo Sodi]], was her brother, who had been trying to save his sister. Ventress and Boba, who managed to remain on the tram, argued about the situation after Pluma pleaded with the former Sith acolyte, who felt sympathy for the girl; Ventress had also been forcibly taken from her home. Boba, on the other hand, intended to continue with the operation. Ventress used [[the Force]] to [[Force choke|choke]] Boba, preventing him from fulfilling the mission<ref name=\"Bounty\" /> and pulling him into the same room where Pluma and Krismo were being kept.<ref name=\"The Lost Nightsister\">{{Shortstory|story=The Lost Nightsister|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}</ref>\n\nOnce the tram arrived at its destination, Ventress delivered the chest to Blank and claimed the bounty, departing before the ruler could discover the chest's contents: an angry Boba, who Ventress had tied up and placed into the chest. Ventress had released Pluma to her brother and regrouped with the other bounty hunters, paying them their shares of the bounty before parting company with them.

However, Ventress' history with the team continued to haunt the crew. In the waning years of the Clone Wars, Boba was approached by the Jedi [[Quinlan Vos]] while frequenting [[Unidentified bar (Level 1313)|one]] of Coruscant's [[Level 1313]] bars. Vos was interested in hunting down the former Sith for a planned assassination attempt on Count Dooku and wanted to partner with Ventress. Boba informed Vos that Ventress was [[Capture of Moregi|hunting]] a [[Volpai]] fugitive named [[Moregi]] on the moon [[Pantora]].<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n[[File:Dathomir_Disciple.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Boba Fett and the rest of Krayt's Claw were hired by Asajj Ventress to rescue Jedi Quinlan Vos.]]\nUsing Fett's information, Vos traveled to Pantora where he rendezvoused with Ventress. After doing several bounty hunting jobs together, Vos revealed his true mission to Ventress, who agreed to train him in the ways of the [[dark side of the Force]]. When Vos' [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|attempt]] failed, Ventress approached Boba once again at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] on Tatooine with the hopes of recruiting his syndicate to rescue her new partner turned lover. While initially cool, Fett and his fellow bounty hunters accepted Ventress' job after she offered to pay 250,000 [[credit]]s in advance. Satisfied, Boba and his allies joined Ventress on her [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|mission]] to rescue Vos. However, Dooku defeated Fett and his fellow bounty hunters with relative ease and Ventress's attempt to save Vos resulted in failure as well. Defeated but alive, Boba and his crew retreated from Serenno.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n===The Ensuing Years===\n[[File:Captured-Transformations.png|right|thumb|250px|Fett captures his quarry]]\n====Assuming the mantle====\nAt some point during his childhood years, like how he had with Sing, Fett learned about the bounty hunting trade from Cad Bane and Ohnaka.<ref name=\"Galactic Explorer's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide]]''</ref> In the ensuing years, Boba gained a reputation as one of the deadliest bounty hunters in [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"Boba Databank\" /> One of his known tactics was disintegrating his adversaries.<ref name=\"Boba Bio Gallery\">{{Databank|boba-fett-biography-gallery|Boba Fett Biography Gallery|archivedate=20190910042242}}</ref> As his career evolved, Boba inherited his father's Mandalorian armor, rebuilding it in Jango's memory.

However, the Hutt crime lord instead hired the [[Rodian]] bounty hunter [[Greedo]], who considered himself better than Fett but failed in the mission. Fett was present in [[Jabba's Palace]] when the crime lord reprimanded Greedo, nearly throwing the Rodian into his [[Rancor]] pit until [[Ithorian]] [[Dok-Ondar]] agreed to purchase a [[Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber|special lightsaber]] the bounty hunter had recovered on the mission.<ref name=\"GE2\">[[Galaxy's Edge 2|''Galaxy's Edge'' 2]]</ref>\n\nBoba was present when Jabba discouraged a pair of travelers from seeking to acquire the alcoholic beverage Desert Wind from a group of Tuskens.

But after catching wind that Vader was looking for a couple of runaway droids, Boba changed plans in order to attempt to collect the bounty. He followed one of the droids' footprints which led to treadmarks made by a [[sandcrawler]]. Upon tracing the sandcrawler's path to its destination, he discovered that the [[Jawa]]s had been wiped out, most likely by stormtroopers. After additional work, Boba deduced that the Empire's forces had seemingly killed everyone known to have seen the droids. This included the two inhabitants living at a torched moisture farm which Boba had investigated. With careful observation, Boba found that there had been three inhabitants living in that moisture farm, and that the third inhabitant had most likely run off with the droids.<ref name=\"Added Muscle\" />\n\nLater, Boba was present in [[Mos Eisley]] on Tatooine when Jabba confronted [[Han Solo]], one of the Hutt's [[smuggler]]s; Solo owed Jabba money after having dumped his smuggling cargo before his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', was boarded by soldiers from the [[Galactic Empire]]. Solo promised Jabba he would pay him, but a bounty had been placed on the smuggler's head. Solo, who became a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic,<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> ultimately did not pay Jabba, leading Boba to pursue the bounty.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Bounty for the Dark Lord====\n{{Quote|There is an X-Wing pilot.

However, Vader arrived a day early on behalf of himself. Jabba was wary of Vader, but ordered his court to leave them in privacy nonetheless. Vader soon revealed that he needed two of Jabba's top bounty hunters. After Jabba tested the Dark Lord, they came to an agreement, so Jabba sent Boba, and the [[Wookiee]] [[Black Krrsantan]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\nLater that day Boba and Krrsantan met Vader out in the [[desert]] after meeting with Jabba. Vader inquired to whether the two bounty hunters were Jabba's finest, and when Boba assured him they were, Vader gave them each their missions: Boba was to capture a Rebel Alliance pilot who was associated with a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a smuggling vessel known as the ''Millennium Falcon''. And Krrsantan's bounty was on an [[Cylo|Imperial agent]] who the Emperor favored. He was also to be apprehended alive. Boba assured Vader that his will would be done. The Dark Lord told them to start immediately as he basked in a [[Tusken Raider]] camp he had slaughtered earlier.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\nPer Vader's orders, Boba began the search immediately. He knew Solo frequented Mos Eisley, so he started there to find Solo's accomplice. Boba soon found a group of four Rodians and informed them of his search for Kenobi, to which the lead Rodian replied that Kenobi was just some \"crazy old wizard,\" who lived in the Dune Sea, and asked why Boba was looking for the wizard. Boba pointed his weapon at the Rodian, stated that Kenobi was dead, and that he alone would be asking the questions.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Fettcrashesthecantina.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Boba addresses the patrons of Chalmun's Cantina.]]\nBoba then killed the Rodians, after they proved useless, and went in search of others who might know anything useful about the boy. He came across a group of Jawas that he also killed, then a family of moisture farmers that he interrogated, before murdering them as well. All leads proved fruitless, therefore, Boba headed towards the cantina, the place where most of Tatooine's scum and villainy went to drink.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref>\n\nBoba entered, stood as the center of attention, and addressed the gathered criminals and spacers, telling them he was not going to leave until someone provided him with the boy's name. However, while Boba threatened an [[Ithorian]], someone in the back of the room spoke up and mocked that the only boy he saw, was Boba. The bounty hunter demanded to know who had insulted him, and was pleased when a six-armed<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" /> over two meter tall<ref name=\"Tall alien\">In [[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]], the alien is depicted as being over a head taller than Boba.

Boba quickly overpowered the alien, removing one of its arms and breaking three others, in order to intimidate the patrons into answering his questions. Boba again demanded the boy's name. but [[Wuher]] the cantina's [[bartender]], said that no one there knew the boy, therefore, no one knew his name; only that Kenobi had been in the cantina recently with the boy, but that was all anyone knew about him. Suddenly, [[Unidentified moisture farmer (Chalmun's Cantina)|a young moisture farmer]] bolted towards the exit, but Boba fired a length of fibercord that tripped up the teen. The young farmer claimed he didn't know anything, but to Boba, he obviously did for he had tried to run. Boba tied the young man to a table and and proceeded to interrogate him. The teen eventually broke and told Boba the boy's history on Tatooine, and most importantly, his name: [[Luke Skywalker]]. The bounty hunter knew the teen spoke the truth and released the boy who had \"only wanted a drink,\" however, shot him in the chest right after.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" />\n\n====Duel with Skywalker====\n{{Quote|You're running out of options.

A group of Tusken Raiders were ransacking Kenobi's home, but Skywalker and his astromech droid soon arrived and Skywalker chased them off with [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Boba stealthily closed in on them as they [[Duel in Ben Kenobi's home|entered]] the hut. Boba threw a [[flash grenade]] that temporarily blinded Skywalker and short-circuited his droid, R2-D2.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" />\n\nBoba moved in and hit Skywalker across the head with his carbine and ordered him to surrender. Skywalker, however, struck Boba in the stomach, hitting Boba's armor. Skywalker, as he was blind, mistook Boba for a [[stormtrooper]]. Skywalker deduced that since Boba hadn't killed him, whoever had hired the bounty hunter wanted Skywalker alive, so he ignited his lightsaber after Boba warned that Skywalker needn't be walking, just \"alive.\" Skywalker told Boba that the bounty hunter never should have come to Kenobi's home, and was adamant that he would fight Boba blind; for Jedi didn't need [[eye]]s&mdash;although, as Boba reminded him, he was no Jedi. Skywalker swung wildly, giving Boba the chance to shoot a length of fibercord that Skywalker surprisingly evaded. Skywalker used the noise that Boba's Mandalorian armor produced to fight him, and caused Boba to stumble backwards and trip over Artoo, prompting them both to charge each other.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref>\n\nThe bounty hunter cut Skywalker several times with [[vibroblade]]s that extended from his gauntlets, drawing blood several times. Boba again ordered him to surrender. Skywalker, therefore, added that Kenobi could help him [[Force spirit|even beyond death]], prompting Boba to shoot him in the shoulder. Boba prepared to do so again when Skywalker recited a Jedi saying, and deflected the incoming blaster bolt; forcing Boba to tackle the still-blind boy. Both combatants grappled one another, and Boba began to press the lightsaber towards Skywalker's face. However, a box marked \"For Luke\" suddenly flew across the room and collided with Boba's head, knocking him unconscious. Skywalker and his astromech were equally surprised, but quickly left the hut and Tatooine, leaving Boba to report the events that had transpired to Lord Vader.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n\n[[File:Boba_informs_vader.png|thumb|left|250px|Boba reports to Darth Vader aboard a Star Destroyer.]]\nLater, Boba traveled aboard ''Slave I'' to meet Vader on a Star Destroyer, and reported that the boy had \"gotten lucky\" and escaped. Vader was disappointed and asked if Boba had brought him anything of value. Boba told him he had, at least, discovered the boy's name: Skywalker. Vader remained silent for some time, so Boba left, for their present business was concluded.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" /> Unknown to Boba, he had just told the Dark Lord that he had a son.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 6\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 6]]</ref>\n\nBoba tracked down a group of rebels on [[Carajam]]. There, he rode a creature and attacked the rebel encampent. There, Boba was able to grab his bounty, a rebel pilot. Upon collecting the 50,000 credit reward for the rebel pilot, Boba decided to collect the 100,000 credit bounty on known rebel collaborator, [[Zingo Gabnit]]. He returned to the [[Death Plains]] where he found [[Turfitch]] dying after Gabnit shot him. Boba shot Gabnit and continued to track him to settlement. There, he found several people tied up and heard Gabnit offering to pay three times what the [[Xan sisters]] offered him. Boba saw a explosive and was blown out the door. Despite that, he was able to capture him and shot him. Boba dragged Gabnit's body and was thanked by several villagers. He was asked by [[Stallo]] to help his fellow villagers take out the Xan sisters. Boba refused and decided to collect the bounty on Stallo.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion\" />\n\n====The hunt for Han Solo====\n{{Quote|There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the ''Millennium Falcon''.

Five other hunters, including Fett's old allies Dengar and Bossk, were also gathered aboard the [[Star Dreadnought]], though his two old partners were the only hunters he fully recognized. Though he realized they seemed familiar, Fett was unable to place the names of [[4-LOM]], [[Zuckuss]], and [[IG-88B]].

Boba and the other bounty hunters were given permission to use any means necessary to capture Skywalker's friends, as long as they were captured alive. Vader singled out Boba and warned against disintegrations, to which Fett responded as the Sith Lord wished. After getting an idea, Boba went to work programming decoy coordinates on ''Slave I'' to fool other Bounty Hunters that might pursue him. He jumped out and then jumped back into proximity of the Imperial Fleet, locating the ''Millennium Falcon'' quickly, having previously deduced that Solo would try to outlast the Empire rather than risk losing it in a chase.<ref name=\"Wait for It\" />\n\nBoba proceeded to dock within the Star Destroyer ''[[Avenger]]'', coming up with a story of having a leak on his ship as a reason for staying behind.

Since Boba had seemingly disappeared from the dock, a member of waste disposal, [[Carl Ashon]], was assigned to handle cleanup from the emitting coolant leak on ''Slave I''. He quickly discovered what Boba had witnessed; the ''Millennium Falcon'' was attached on the hull of the Avenger. As Ashon started to make plans on claiming the bounty, he was interrupted by Boba Fett. Ahson proposed splitting the bounty between him and Boba. Boba seemingly agreed before proceeding to knock Ashon unconscious. Fett then placed Ashon within a stripped-down ''Lambda '' shuttle that was promptly ejected from the ''Avenger'', ensuring that Ashon would not interfere with Boba's plan.<ref name=\"Standard Imperial Procedure\">{{Shortstory|story=Standard Imperial Procedure|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Boba then pursued the Falcon out of the system as they made their way to [[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]].

Solo survived the process, however, and Vader turned the frozen smuggler over to Boba, who had Solo taken to ''Slave I''.

At the same time, an alarm signal from the carbonite block sounded and Boba discovered that strange stains had formed on the surface of the frozen Han Solo. He cut off his call with Fortuna and left for Nar Shadda, where he met with his old contact [[Doc Ragon]]. The doc informed him that the carbonite matrix with an organic being in it was unstable, but he also offered to solve the problem. When Boba explained that he would be unable to pay at the moment, Ragon gave him the alternative of killing Kanji Hutts' arena [[Pit fighting|pit warrior]] [[Wyrmen Lictor]], whom the Doctor had hated since she killed a fighter he had bet a lot of money on. At first, Boba did not want to anger the Kanjis, especially since they would recognize him by his armor. However, Ragon offered to make his armor unrecognizable with a [[nanospray]], finally revealing to Boba that Wyrmen Lictor was the current champion of the arena.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha 1\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Black_Jango.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Boba Fett entered the pit fights as \"Beskar Brawler Jango\" to hide his identity.]]\nIn now all black armor, Boba competed in the arena under the name of his father. As \"Beskar Brawler Jango\", Boba killed many fighters, including [[Jonny the Sting]], [[Skullicon]] and [[Bigbot]], in order to finally fight against Wyrmen Lictor, despite the warning of another gladiator. With the arena designed as a web for their fight, Lictor and Fett started their conflict. After he shot her blasters out of her hands, Lictor ripped off his jetpack with a thread that she shot out of her body. Fett managed to sever one of her legs but was hit in the shoulder by another. When Lictor stood over him and felt confident of victory, Fett let his jetpack explode, which led to the previous arena champion falling into the depths and being crushed by the falling stones. After Fett asked for his credits from the Pa'lowick who worked at the entrance to the arena, he was denied by several Kanjis who wanted him to fight in the arena for them, as they wanted to win back the money they had bet on Lictor. Unwilling to return to the fighting arena and knowing he had to return to Ragon, Fett refused and returned to Ragon's quarters, where he found the doc to be dead and Han Solo to be stolen. At the same moment, Fortuna contacted him again, telling him that Jabba was slowly getting impatient for his prey. Fett assured the Twi'lek that he would not disappoint Jabba, but that the Hutt would have to be patient.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha 1\" />\n\n=====Betrayed by Jabba=====\n{{Quote|I said at the beginning of all this that someone was going to die.

He then saw a reflection in a glass of one of the patrons aiming their blaster at him, to which he quickly shot them down. As he left the bar, Fett left a message for Fortuna, reassuring the Twi'lek that he would deliver Solo as agreed. However, as Fett entered his ship, he noticed a thermal detonator, which promptly exploded and sent him flying back. He was then met by Zukuss, who told Fett that he had questions for him. Fett responded by firing a rocket from his jetpack, which Zuckuss dodged. Zuckuss was then joined by 4-LOM, who took aim at Fett and forced him to stand down. Fett asked them what the attack was about and 4-LOM ordered him to tell them where Solo was. Angered that they had gone inside his ship, Fett remotely turned on its weapons and flew out of the way as they fired on the two bounty hunters. Once the firing stopped, Fett came back down and found Zuckuss hanging by the edge of the landing platform. Fett went to kick him off, but Zuckuss tried to stop him by telling him his future. The future he described was of Fett drowning in a sea of red. However, Fett said he wasn't interested and kicked Zuckuss off the edge, sending him plummeting into the city below.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 1\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 1]]</ref>\n\nFett then discovered 4-LOM, blasted in half and telling Fett to stay back. However, Fett used one of his wrist blades to sever the droid's head and took it onto the ship with him. 4-LOM stated that Fett was his target, to which Fett said the droid must be mistaken. Fett then connected 4-LOM's head with the ship's computer and placed a restraining bolt on him. When Fett asked the droid who sent him and how he had learned of Solo's whereabouts, 4-LOM revealed that an open contract had been placed on Fett himself, dead or alive with Solo's delivery as a bonus. When Fett asked who had placed the bounty, the droid responded that the client was Jabba. Armed with this new information, Fett returned to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine. As he approached the palace, 4-LOM tried to convince Fett that he could still be useful to him, to which Fett promptly tossed his head over the side of the bridge. Upon reaching the palace's entrance, Fett was stopped by two Gamorrean guards, who he told to stand aside lest they end up like the droid. He was then met by Bib Fortuna, who told Fett they could resolve the matter without violence. Fett disagreed before quickly dispatching the two guards. Fortuna attempted to threaten Fett, but Fett aimed his wrist-mounted flamethrower at the Twi'lek and demanded to know why Jabba had placed a bounty on him.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 1\" />\n\nFortuna revealed that Jabba had learned about Fett's loss of Solo and assumed the bounty hunter had sold him. Fett retorted that Solo had been stolen from him and demanded to see Jabba. But Fortuna replied that Jabba was not there at the moment. When Fett asked the Twi'lek where his boss was, Fortuna answered that he had received an invitation from the ones who had stolen Solo to buy him from them. With more palace guards gathering around them, Fortuna suggested that Fett leave the premises. However, Fett threatened them and asked them if they truly wanted to die for Fortuna. They then responded by clearing the way for him, allowing him to enter the palace and see the invitation that Jabba had received. The invitation was a recording of a [[Qi'ra|hooded woman]] with the still frozen Han Solo. In the message, she announced the return of crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]] and invited Jabba to a celebration on [[Jekara]].

He then saw another group of gangsters heading towards the Vermillion and told their leader to give him their invitation and cloak. However, Fett was then attacked by Bossk, who had come to claim Jabba's bounty. With his flamethrower and jetpack, Fett managed to blow off the Trandoshan's legs, subduing him. Bossk reminded Fett of their history together and asked if he was going to kill him. But Fett said he was going to use him as a message to dissuade any other bounty hunters from coming after him. He then tied up Bossk and left him out in the cold as he retrieved his disguise and infiltrated the ''Vermillion.''<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 2\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 2|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 2]]</ref>\n\nOnce inside the ship, Fett found himself amongst a crowd of representatives from every major criminal faction in the underworld. Among the crowd, he recognized a particular face; [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]]. Fett approached Aphra and took her by the arm, telling her associate [[Sana Starros]] to lower her blaster. Being a noted [[archaeologist]] who knew her history, Aphra recognized from Fett's voice that he was a clone. Fett then told Aphra to help him or he would alert Crimson Dawn to her presence. Giving her a comm button, he told Aphra to create a diversion once he triggered the button. However, they were then interrupted by [[Lord|Lady]] Qi'ra, who presented Solo to the bidders and commenced the [[Auction for Han Solo|auction]].<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 12\">[[Doctor Aphra (2020) 12|''Doctor Aphra'' (2020) 12]]</ref>\n\nAfter telling Aphra to be ready, Fett disappeared from the crowd. With the auction underway, he removed his disguise and got back into his armor. But as he went to retrieve Solo, he ran into Leia Organa, Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca, who were also there to rescue the smuggler. At the same time, Jabba won the auction and told his fellow Hutts to wrap Solo up for him so they could leave. However, the auction was then interrupted by the arrival of Darth Vader. Guarded by two [[death trooper]]s, Vader declared that Solo belonged to him.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 2\" /> While Vader argued with Jabba over Solo, Leia told Chewbacca to take Fett down quietly.

Skywalker refused however and told Vader to come to him. Vader conceded, ordering Romodi to bring Solo aboard his star destroyer and prepare his fighter.

But Fett refused, saying that he was sick of being attacked by nobodies. Dengar was then joined by Beilert Valance before they both attacked Fett. Fett however quickly subdued Dengar with a single rocket, leaving the Corellian stranded on a floating iceberg. While Fett was distracted, Valance held one of his hands to the back of Fett's head and demanded to know where Solo was. Fett then remarked that Valance was too late as Vader's shuttle departed from Jekara with Solo onboard.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 4\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 4|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 4]]</ref>\n\nAs Vader left with Solo, Fett offered to work with Valance to get Solo back. Valance initially refused, saying that he should kill Fett for what he did to Nakano Lash and that doing so would prevent Fett from betraying him later. Fett admitted that would be cleaner, but not easier. He then told Valance that whichever one of them got Solo after, at least the Empire wouldn't have him. With this, Valance accepted Fett's offer and asked him how they would get to the star destroyer, to which Fett told Valance to let him worry about that.<ref name=\"War of the Bounty Hunters 4\" />\n\nAs they approached Vader's star destroyer in ''Slave I'', Valance spotted the ''Millenium Falcon'' nearby and warned Fett not to destroy it or else they would have a problem.

Much to Valance's surprise, the ruse worked and he and Fett were allowed onto Vader's flagship. Once inside, Valance used his knowledge of the Empire to guide Fett towards the detention level. Upon reaching the level, they were attacked by a [[KX-series security droid]], though Valance managed to dispatch it quickly. However, Valance was then betrayed by Fett, who threw a thermal detonator at him and caused his body to explode.

While Jabba explained how he had suddenly become the sole leader of the Hutt Clans, as Darth Vader had executed the [[Grand Hutt Council]] during the battle, Fett remained focused on the money he was owed. While he advised Jabba to throw Solo into the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] to spare him the trouble the smuggler would bring, he then returned his focus to business matters, demanding that Jabba pay him after all he had been through.<ref name=\"WotBH 5\" />\n\n====Into the sarlacc====\n{{Quote|Boba Fett?

Sometime later, he witnessed Skywalker and Chewbacca be captured by the Hutt, while Organa posed as the bounty hunter Boushh and Calrissian posed as a guard. Organa was, however, able to free Solo from carbonite freezing, and the smuggler emerged temporarily blind as a result of the freezing process and Organa got captured and made a slave girl for Jabba. At Jabba's decree, Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca were to be taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where they would be fed to the [[sarlacc]]&mdash;a creature that lived in the pit that would digest them over the course of a thousand years.

During the firefight, Boba fought against Skywalker, who used his lightsaber to destroy Boba's blaster. In the ensuing chaos, Solo&mdash;still somewhat blind&mdash; was alerted to Boba's presence and swung out wildly with a vibro-ax, striking Boba's jetpack as he took aim at Skywalker with his wrist gauntlet.

Once Djarin and Mayfeld completed their mission, Fett flew in with ''Slave I'' to extract the duo. After boarding the ship, Mayfeld asked Djarin to give him one of the cycler rifles, which Mayfeld used to fire at the [[rhydonium]] within the refinery, destroying the cargo they had delivered and setting off a massive explosion.

Lucas contemplated adding a scene in ''Return of the Jedi'' where Boba climbed out of the sarlacc pit, especially in light of the character's story in ''Attack of the Clones'', but ultimately decided against it because he thought that the audience would believe that Fett would appear later in the film if this scene had been seen.<ref name=\"Jedi DVD commentary\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] DVD commentary</ref> However, on [[July 16]], [[2014]], ''Star Wars'' author and historian [[Jonathan W.

Fett was meant to participate during the [[Great Jedi Purge]] as the killer of Mace Windu instead of Darth Sidious, via shooting him with his blaster while he was escaping from some stormtroopers, ending his vendetta against him due to the death of Jango once and for all.
