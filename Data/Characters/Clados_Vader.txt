I have your friend.|Clados Vader to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (1987 video game)}}\n'''Clados Vader''' was a mysterious [[Changeling/Legends|changeling]] entity who dwelled in the oceans of [[Iskalon/Legends|Iskalon]]. It was a giant deformed [[Shark/Legends|shark]], and it could turn into the shape of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Clados was killed by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] for having captured the [[Gold/Legends|golden]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|It's C-3PO. I'm being held on Iskalon. Come save me!|C-3PO calling Luke Skywalker for help|Star Wars (1987 video game)}}\nClados Vader was a malevolent [[Changeling/Legends|shapeshifter]] who lived on the [[Water/Legends|oceanic]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Iskalon/Legends|Iskalon]],<ref name=\"SW87\" /> in the [[Mid Rim|Mid Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> It could assume the appearance of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]&mdash;hence the creature's name.<ref name=\"SW87\" />\n\nShortly before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], Clados Vader took the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] hostage in an underwater chamber. [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] came to rescue his friend and confronted the monster, who had metamorphosed into Lord Vader. One swipe of the [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentice's]] [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and the fake Vader transformed back into its real form, an enormous [[Shark/Legends|shark]]-like creature with a pinkish [[Color/Legends|hue]]. After the shapeshifter was defeated, Luke Skywalker and C-3PO set off to battle the Death Star.<ref name=\"SW87\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nClados Vader was one of the stage bosses in the Japanese [[Star Wars (1987 video game)|''Star Wars'' 1987 video game]].<ref name=\"SW87\" /> The game featured various fake Vaders which all happened to be shapeshifting monsters. The canonicity of this game and the creatures it features is dubious.\n\nAccording to both \"[[Game On!]],\" an article published in [[Star Wars Insider 135|''Star Wars Insider'' 135]], and the game manual, the fake Vaders (Clados, [[Gyaos Vader|Gyaos]], [[Sasori Vader|Sasori]] and [[Wampa Vader|Wampa]]) were \"intended as illusions representing Luke's fears, like the [[Dark Side Cave|Cave of Evil]] scene in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Empire Strikes Back'']].\"<ref name=\"SWI135\">{{InsiderCite|135|Game On!}}</ref> However, since those game opponents were able to kidnap Luke Skywalker's allies and hold them prisoner,<ref name=\"SW87\" /> this article assumes they were real creatures rather than illusions. Additionally, the Vader-shaped figure that Skywalker fought in the Cave of Evil was more than mere illusion, being in fact a protean [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] entity known as the [[Dark Spirit]].<ref name=\"toy\">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: Power of the Jedi|text=''Star Wars: Power of the Jedi''|pack=Darth Vader (Dagobah)|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/potjdagvader.asp|archivedate=20191226020522}}</ref>\n\nIn the original [[Wikipedia:Japanese language|Japanese]] version, he was identified via [[Wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]] syllabary as \u30af\u30e9\u30c9\u30b9\u30d9\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc (''Kuradosu Beid\u0101''). While ''Beid\u0101'' is a transliteration of \"Vader\" in Japanese, the element \u30af\u30e9\u30c9\u30b9 (''kuradosu'') derives from the Japanese name of shark genera, as examplified by the zoological names \u30af\u30e9\u30c9\u30bb\u30e9\u30b1 (''Cladoselache'') and \u30af\u30e9\u30c9\u30c0\u30b9 (''Cladodus'').\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1987 video game)|''Star Wars'' (1987 video game)]] {{1st}} {{Nc}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|135|Game On!}}\n*{{SW|url=news/hiding-in-plain-sight-star-wars-shapeshifters|text=Hiding in Plain Sight: ''Star Wars'' Shapeshifters}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vader, Clados}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Iskalonians]]\n[[Category:Shape-shifting individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
