As a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], he was selected by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] for training. Initially, he received this at the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], before transferring to [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] along with four other trainees. There, he was apprenticed under the [[Feeorin/Legends|Feeorin]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Feln]]. He progressed through his training, constructing a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and bringing down the [[Leverby smuggling ring]]. As Oojoh and his companions neared the end of their training, they underwent a [[Jedi Trials/Legends|final test]] on the [[Rogue moon]]&mdash;a rock in an [[Taris asteroid belt|inner]] [[asteroid belt]] of the [[Taris system/Legends|Taris system]]. There, he successfully traversed the terrain with only [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to guide him, avoiding a multitude of [[meteor]]s raining down from above.\n\nHowever, Oojoh's promotion to [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] was not to be. While he and the other trainees were crossing the Rogue moon, their masters received a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] crumbling due to the rise of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Determined to prevent such an occurrence, and led by elements of their vision to believe one of their [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] would be responsible, the Masters agreed to kill their own Padawans. Shortly after returning to Taris, at a special ceremony ostensibly to announce the graduates, four of the five Padawans, including Oojoh, were [[Padawan Massacre|massacred]]. The final remaining Padawan, [[Zayne Carrick]], escaped, and was framed by the Masters. Eventually, however, he cleared his name, and Oojoh's family finally learned the truth behind his death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and training===\n{{Quote|We're in position, Padawans.

The five Jedi trainees&mdash;the others being [[Gharn]], a [[Nagai]]; [[Kamlin]], a [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]]; and two [[Human/Legends|Humans]], [[Shad Jelavan]] and [[Zayne Carrick]]<ref>''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref>&mdash;grew up together, and were each assigned to a Jedi Master.<ref name=\"KOTOR4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 4|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 4]]</ref> Oojoh was assigned to an imposing [[Feeorin/Legends|Feeorin]] Jedi named [[Feln]].<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> Under his training, Oojoh successfully brought down the [[Leverby smuggling ring]]<ref name=\"TTH\" /> led by [[Loopy Leverby]],<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> an achievement noted by the [[Taris Holofeed]].<ref name=\"TTH\" />\n\nOojoh was present in [[3964 BBY]], when the Taris academy was visited by [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Darth Malak|Alek Squinquargesimus]] and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who were on their way to the front lines of an emerging conflict between the Republic and the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]]. The pair of Knights advocated direct Jedi involvement in the conflict, and sought support from the Taris Masters. They were turned down, however, as the Taris Masters considered the war secondary to efforts to prevent the return of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]].<ref name=\"KOTOR0\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 0|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 0]]</ref>\n\n===Trials on the Rogue moon===\n[[File:Rogue_moon_trial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oojoh descends to the Rogue moon.]]\n{{Quote|Who? Who did you see?''\"<br />\"''A figure in red armor&mdash;no. Not armor. An environment suit&mdash;just like the Padawans wear now!|Lucien Draay and Feln|Knights of the Old Republic 5}}\nThe next week,<ref name=\"KOTOR0\" /> the five Padawans were transported up to the [[Rogue moon]], located within an [[asteroid belt]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] Taris's [[Taris (star)|sun]], for their final [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi test]]. The Rogue moon traveled in the opposite direction to the rest of the [[Taris asteroid belt|asteroid field]]; consequently, it suffered a constant barrage of [[meteor]] impacts of all sizes. This was considered a suitable location to test the trainees' ability to \"see\" using only the Force. Each Padawan was clad in a heavy red [[Enviro-suit]] with its visor down. In this manner, the Force was the only sense they had available to avoid the constant barrage of meteor impacts.<ref name=\"KOTOR4\" /> While his master piloted the [[Transport/Legends|starship]], Oojoh and the other Padawans were dropped from the ship to [[Gravity/Legends|drift]] to the moon's surface below.<ref name=\"KOTOR3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 3|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 3]]</ref>\n\nOojoh safely crossed the valley&mdash;neither the quickest nor the slowest of the Padawans&mdash;and rejoined the Masters who had been waiting on the far side. While waiting, however, the Masters had not been idle. Four of the masters&mdash;Feln, [[Xamar]], [[Q'Anilia]], and [[Raana Tey]]&mdash;were trained [[Jedi Consular|Consulars]], a class of Jedi that specialized in Force skills of a cerebral nature, including healing, research, and [[Precognition/Legends|precognition]].<ref name=\"KOTOR4\" /> Together, they meditated, and with the Force flowing freely in this location, they each received a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] of the future: their own [[Death/Legends|deaths]] and accompanying ruin for [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Oojoh's master Feln saw himself cut down on his homeworld [[Odryn]], while others saw the return of the Sith, the fall of Jedi Order, or the ruin of the Republic. The [[Rogue Moon Prophecy|four visions]] were unified by one feature: each involved a figure wearing a red environment suit, just like their Padawans were wearing.<ref name=\"KOTOR5\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 5|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\n{{Quote|As you know, since you've all completed the Jedi trials, in tonight's ceremony my fellow masters will reveal the names of those submitted to Coruscant for the title of Jedi Knight.

When they finally emerged, they announced they had made their decisions as to who would graduate to [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"KOTOR4\" /> They organized a celebratory banquet ahead of their official announcements, to which they invited various family members and guests. Oojoh was present along with Gharn, Jelavan, and Kamlin, but the final Padawan, Carrick, was late. Having been making one final attempt to catch [[Marn Hierogryph]], a local [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]] criminal, Carrick was foiled and actually crashed through the window of the banquet hall. At this surprise entry, Oojoh ignited his lightsaber, along with the eight other Jedi present, placing them at the throat of the intruder. Although suffering embarrassment, Carrick received no further harm.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" />\n\nLater that evening, Oojoh was present for the [[Knighting ceremony/Legends|graduation ceremony]] in the council chambers at the top of the Jedi tower, although once again Carrick was late arriving.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" /> While the other Jedi waited for him, Shad Jelavan questioned whether Carrick would graduate with the rest of the class. When [[Lucien Draay]], Carrick's master, answered in the affirmative, Oojoh expressed his surprise at the announcement&mdash;Carrick had always finished last in each of the Jedi assignments. His reaction was shared by the other Padawans, each of whom had heard their masters speak disparagingly of the Human; Oojoh's own Master Feln frequently called him a \"buffoon.\" As the Padawans continued pressing the Masters, Jelavan detected that they were lying. Agitated by the Padawans, the Masters took action earlier than planned:<ref name=\"KOTOR6\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]]</ref> igniting his lightsaber, Feln [[Padawan Massacre|killed]] Oojoh, stabbing him through his torso, while the other Masters, likewise, killed their Padawans.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" /> The Masters believed this act was the only way to prevent their visions coming to fulfillment&mdash;a tragic intervention to save the galaxy.<ref name=\"KOTOR6\" /> It was at this point that Carrick stumbled into the Council Chambers. Seeing the massacre before him, he quickly fled the scene.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Oojoh_nightmare.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oojoh and Gharn appear to Raana Tey in a nightmare.]]\n{{Quote|And now you're back with us, Master Raana Tey.|Oojoh to Raana Tey in her Force vision.|Knights of the Old Republic 16}}\nInitially, the murder of Oojoh and the other Padawans was blamed on Carrick, who managed to successfully evade the Jedi Masters attempts to capture him.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> The death of the Padawans, combined with the growing threat of the Mandalorians, caused riots on Taris, and the Masters were subsequently recalled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and then split up.<ref name=\"KOTOR6\" /> Master Raana Tey subsequently returned to Taris in pursuit of Carrick, and en route had a nightmare in which Oojoh and the other murdered apprentices swapped positions with their masters and forced her to look at her own body.<ref name=\"KOTOR16\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 16|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 16]]</ref> Despite being pursued by the Taris Masters, Carrick eventually managed to clear his name of the murders, and the Jedi Order revealed the truth to Oojoh's family, although it was kept secret from the galaxy at large.<ref>[[Knights of the Old Republic 35|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 35]]</ref> Oojoh's family later worked with Carrick as part of the [[Rogue Moon Project]], looking after those marginalised by the war.<ref>[[Knights of the Old Republic 48|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 48]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Us&mdash;and Zayne too! I never would have thought!|Oojoh, on the forthcoming promotions|Knights of the Old Republic 6}}\nOojoh was green skinned, with head-tendrils of mixed blue-green coloration, one of which he wrapped like a [[Padawan braid/Legends|Padawan braid]]. He typically wore a yellow shirt with a brown vest over the top, along with some shoulder guards decorated in gold. He wore black boots, and finally, a [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]] with numerous pockets.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" /> Oojoh appeared genuinely pleased to hear that his childhood companion and peer, Zayne Carrick, would graduate to Knighthood, even if the news surprised him. However, when Jelavan, the nominal leader of the trainees, began to question this decision, Oojoh followed along.<ref name=\"KOTOR6\" />\n\nOojoh was Force-sensitive and a competent Jedi trainee. For instance, while practicing policing duties on Taris, he brought down the Leverby smuggling ring. Similarly, while on the Rogue moon, he was able to use the Force to guide his steps so as to avoid being struck by a meteor. While he was not the fastest to cross the valley, nor was he the slowest of the Padawans.<ref name=\"KOTOR4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOojoh was created by [[John Jackson Miller]] for the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] comic series [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comic series)|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'']]. He debuted in [[Knights of the Old Republic 1|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 1]] ([[2006]]) and subsequently appeared in most of the issues of the first story arc [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Commencement|''Commencement'']],<ref>The only one of these issues he did not appear in was Issue #5.</ref> and two subsequent issues. However, he was never named in any of the issues&mdash;that only occurred in [[Knights of the Old Republic 0|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 0]] a promotional comic set before the main story arc that included an in-universe newsreel&mdash;and overall, only received three lines.<ref name=\"KOTOR6\" /><ref name=\"KOTOR16\" /> Oojoh also appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]'', which was the first [[canon]] confirmation that he was Feln's Padawan&mdash;although Miller had previously confirmed this in the production notes on his website<ref name=\"Faraway\">{{Faraway|url=comics/starwarsknightsoftheoldrepublic/starwarsknightsoftheoldrepublic6|text=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic #6|archivedate=20210319165153}}</ref>&mdash;and in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\nOojoh's lightsaber color is never directly specified; however, in the first issue, nine lightsabers (six green and three blue) are shown to correspond to the nine Jedi other than Zayne Carrick. Of these nine, five (four green, one blue) belonged to the Masters, and the two remaining blue blades were shown to belong to Gharn and Shad Jelevan, leaving green blades for Oojoh and Kamlin.<ref name=\"KOTOR1\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Oojoh}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 0|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 0]]\n*''[[The Taris Holofeed: Prime Edition]]'' &ndash; [[Knights of the Old Republic 0|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 0]] {{1stID}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 1|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 3|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 3]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 4|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 4]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 9]] {{Hologram}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 16|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 16]] {{Vision|[[Raana Tey]]}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 48|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 48]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Oojoh\n|es=Oojoh\n|pl=Oojoh\n}}\n\n[[Category:Ho'Din]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
