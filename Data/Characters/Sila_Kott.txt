It's bad enough flying a transport, feeling like all those soldiers' lives are in your hands. But taking someone's life? I can't do it.|Sila Kott on her reluctance to become a starfighter pilot|Rendezvous Point (short story)}}\n'''Sila Kott''', a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] from [[Toprawa]], was a [[pilot]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Despite having the qualifications to fly a starfighter, she preferred to fly [[transport]]s as she was reluctant to take a life. However, after the [[Battle of Hoth]], [[Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles]] convinced Kott to join [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] and become a [[starfighter]] pilot. Later, she flew an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing]] as [[Red Three]] at the [[Battle of Endor]], where she was shot down by two [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE Interceptors]] in an attempt to lead them away from her wingmates.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender|female]] [[human]]<ref name=\"Incredibuilds\" /> from the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]<ref name=\"TFABG\">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Beginner Game|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' Beginner Game]]</ref> [[planet]] of [[Toprawa]], Sila Kott ended up joining the [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Starfighter Corps]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]],<ref name=\"Incredibuilds\" /> a resistance movement that sought to topple the [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Rebel Files\">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> In her early days with the Rebel Alliance, she flew troop transports. [[Commander]] [[Arhul Narra]] tried to recruit her into a starfighter squadron, back when he made every pilot do simulator runs, but she refused. It was later determined that she didn't want to fly a starfighter because she never wanted to take someone else's life.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\">{{Shortstory|story=Rendezvous Point (short story)|sformatted=Rendezvous Point|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n===After Hoth===\nShortly after the [[Battle of Hoth|evacuation of Hoth]] in [[3 ABY]],<ref name=\"RPDate\">\"[[Rendezvous Point (short story)|Rendezvous Point]]\" is set in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Hoth]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[3 ABY]]. As such, the events in \"Rendezvous Point\" must have taken place around that year.</ref> Kott was recruited by Commander [[Wedge Antilles]] into the newly reformed [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]]. She purposely sabotaged her simulator training, before revealing to Antilles that she never killed anybody in all the years she'd been with the Rebellion and that she wouldn't take someone's life. Antilles explained to her that they \"pulled the trigger\" to help to create a galaxy where no one has to do it, which meant killing people and that the Alliance and her loved ones needed her. She was assigned the [[callsign]] [[Red Three]] and flew a [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] as Antilles' wingmate, alongside [[Tomer Darpen]], in an [[Attack on an asteroid mining station|attack]] on a nearby [[pirate]] base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\" />\n\n===Endor===\n{{Quote|Got it!|Sila Kott|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\nIn [[4 ABY]],<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> she participated in a decisive [[Battle of Endor|battle]] at [[Endor]], flying an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing interceptor]] with Red Squadron still under the callsign Red Three. Although the rebels managed to destroy the Empire's [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second]] [[Death Star]] [[battlestation]], Kott did not live to see the Alliance triumph. Indeed, at one point during the battle, the pilot went head to head with swarms of [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] fighters, and [[Death|perished]] under enemy fire when she tried to lead two [[TIE/IN interceptor]]s away from her comrades.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nTo honor her contribution to liberating [[the galaxy]], the [[Sila Kott flight school]] was built in her name on her [[Homeworld|home]] planet.<ref name=\"Incredibuilds\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSila Kott first appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], the third and final film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Portrayed by [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|British]] actress [[Poppy Hands]], she was inexplicably dubbed over by an [[Wikipedia:United States|American]] man's voice in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"Poppy\">{{SW|url=news/split-personalities-star-wars-movie-characters-played-by-multiple-actors|text=Split Personalities: ''Star Wars'' Movie Characters Played by Multiple Actors}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, both the official [[Databank (website)|Databank]] on [[StarWars.com]]<ref name=\"Rebel Pilots Databank\" /> and the activity book ''[[Star Wars: A-wing Deluxe Book and 3D Wood Model]]'' correctly identify Kott as a woman.<ref name=\"Incredibuilds\" />\n\nAlthough the Databank has Kott listed as Red Two,<ref name=\"Rebel Pilots Databank\" /> ''Return of the Jedi'' hints at her being Red Three,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> which is confirmed by the ''Deluxe Book and 3D Wood Model''.<ref name=\"Incredibuilds\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Starfighter Missions]]''\n*{{Shortstory|story=Rendezvous Point (short story)|sformatted=Rendezvous Point|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: A-wing Deluxe Book and 3D Wood Model]]''\n*{{Databank|rebel-pilots|Rebel Pilots|archivedate=20200527024015}} {{1stID}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Sila Kott\n|ko=\uc2e4\ub77c \ucf67\n|ru=\u0421\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0442\u0442/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kott, Sila}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Red Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Toprawans]]"}}}]}}}}
