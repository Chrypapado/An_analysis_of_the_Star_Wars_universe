As a result of malfunction, he was trapped behind a security door in the sublevel. When nobody came after him in two weeks and he was running out of food, he deduced that the ground level of the Enclave had been destroyed.\n\n[[3951 BBY|Five years later]], his datapad was found by [[Meetra Surik]] along with his corpse.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dergar Chester\n|pl=Dergar Chester\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chester, Dergar}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
