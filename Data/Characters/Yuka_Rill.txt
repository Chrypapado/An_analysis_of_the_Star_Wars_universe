Why don't you go bother someone else.

In [[3958 BBY]], he was involved in a large crash during a race on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. He had the top time of the second-tier. Rill had raced for many years, but rode an aging [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]]. He had a few trophies, but he believed he should have quit after the [[Coruscant Classic]]. Rill told [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] that he believed that [[Nico Senvi]] had a future, but warned that some promoter would use Senvi, and leave him in debt, similar to the situation that as he found himself with [[Motta]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen the player meets Rill, he has little to say. The one interaction that affects the character in any way is to say to Rill, \"Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm here for money.\" At this point, if the player has high persuasion, Rill can be convinced to give a small amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Conversely, the player may also [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuade]] Rill. Using Force persuade gives you [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points, despite the fact both options involve trickery.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Yuka Rill\n|pl=Yuka Rill\n|ru=\u042e\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0438\u043b\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rill, Yuka}}\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
