He bore an uncanny resemblance to [[Wilhuff Tarkin's father|Wilhuff's father]], so much so that they could have passed for [[twin]]s. In the last [[Standard decade|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], he was one of the most respected [[commander]]s of the [[Outland Regions Security Force]]. At some point, Tarkin designed a ploy to avenge [[Eriadu Mining and Shipping]] from [[Greater Seswenna raids]] done by the [[Q'anah's Marauders]] by introducing a computer virus in the [[hyperdrive]] motivators of several [[container ship]]s. However, Eriadu Mining refused to go along with his plan on [[Currency|cost]] grounds. [[Standard year|Years]] later, when Wilhuff Tarkin had become a [[lieutenant]] in the anti-piracy task force of the Outland, the security force acquired a lead on which containers Q'anah's Marauders would target, and Eriadu Mining finally agreed to finance Ranulph Tarkin's scheme. His plan worked and the [[Pirate]] [[queen]] [[Q'anah]] was [[Prisoner|captured]] and [[Death|executed]].<ref name=\"TarkinNovel\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] {{1stm|[[Tarkin (audiobook)|''Tarkin'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Tarkin (audiobook)|''Tarkin'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Ranulph Tarkin\n|pl=Ranulph Tarkin\n|pt=Ranulf Tarkin\n|ru=\u0420\u0430\u043d\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n|es=Ranulph Tarkin\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarkin, Ranulph}}\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military officers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarkin family]]"}}}]}}}}
