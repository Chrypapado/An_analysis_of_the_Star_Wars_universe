It was composed of juvenile delinquents who had run away or been abandoned by their parents because of their bad behavior. Chief among them was [[Norys]], a youth known for his reputation as a bully. They were the rivals of the [[Blank Look Gang]] and possibly at some point hired [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to prevent the blankers from stealing a collection of [[antique Twi'lek pots]] from the [[Galactic Museum]] in [[CoCo Town/Legends|CoCo Town]].\n\nMembers of the Lost Ones marked their territory with a symbol resembling a targeting cross surrounded by a triangle. Because normal, intact weapons were hard to come by in Coruscant's undercity, they resorted to arming themselves with weapons that had been cobbled together from sharp pieces of scrap.\n\nAfter the botched training of the [[Solo twins]] and [[Lowbacca]], [[Brakiss]] and the [[Great Leader of the Second Imperium]] decided that it would be best to recruit disadvantaged youths instead of the prominent targets that they had kidnapped initially. Given that very few would care about the disappearances and those that did care had very little recourse to the law, this plan had many advantages.\n\nThe members of the Lost Ones fit that profile. After he was captured, Zekk was used by the Shadow Academy to convince them to help fill the ranks of the [[Second Imperium]]. Those who were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] would be trained to be [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. Those who were not still were useful because they knew their way around a planet that was considered to be the heart of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Such knowledge could be turned to the purposes of espionage and sabotage. The latter group would be trained as elite [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and [[TIE pilot]]s.\n\nFormer members of the Lost Ones participated in the [[Third Battle of Yavin|assault]] on the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. Their fate after that is unknown though they were either killed or captured.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030220art|text=Art For Art's Sake|int=Art For Art's Sake|archivedate=20090828012419}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Under Siege]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Verlorene\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminal organizations]]"}}}]}}}}
