He supported the reign of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Leonia Tavira]].\n\nFearful of the changes [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Plourr Ilo]] attempted to institute on [[Eiattu 6]], Laabann attempted to kidnap her to maintain the Priamsta's power. His efforts failed, however, and Plourr, supported by the commoners, was able to end the dominance of the the Priamsta, and to remove [[Harrandatha Estillo (impostor)|the impostor]] pretending to be her brother, [[Harrandatha Estillo]].\n\nSubsequently, Laabann was pardoned and remained at court as leader of what Plourr wryly called the \"loyal opposition\", but a few months later, he betrayed the visiting [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]&mdash;actually, a disguised [[Winter Celchu|Winter]]&mdash;to Moff Tavira. He confessed his crime under interrogation by [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]], and his subsequent fate is unknown.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 14|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 14]] {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 15|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 15]]\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Arian Laabann\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laabann, Arian}}\n[[Category:Eiattuans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
