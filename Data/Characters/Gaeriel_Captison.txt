Of deep feelings.|Luke Skywalker, to Gaeriel Captison|The Truce at Bakura}}\n'''Gaeriel \"Gaeri\" Captison''' was a member of an [[Captison family|influential political family]] on [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]]. Her father, [[Dol Captison]], and his brother, [[Yeorg Captison]], were both [[Senator/Legends|senators]] in the [[Bakuran Senate]]. As a result, she was raised in the presence of notable political figures, and with a desire to follow in her family members' footsteps. Educated at prestigious schools on Bakura and the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for her education, Captison hoped to become part of the Bakuran government, and the death of her parents at the hands of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] stiffened her faith in the [[Cosmic Balance]].\n\nEventually elected as a senator, Captison was influential in the [[Invasion of Bakura|Battle of Bakura]], ultimately siding with the resistance despite her previous Imperial leanings. During the battle, Captison met with a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] delegation that had come to Bakura's aid when the planet was threatened by the alien [[Ssi-ruu]]k. During the battle, she developed an attraction to Rebel Alliance [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], which caused her to become a target for Ssi-ruuk capture, as the aliens were trying to obtain Skywalker for their own purposes. Skywalker fended off her would-be captors and the Ssi-ruuk were defeated, shortly after Bakuran insurrectionists overthrew Imperial rule on Bakura. Captison went on to become the youngest [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister of Bakura]] and led as a staunch ally of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. She married former [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial]] [[Navy/Legends|naval]] officer [[Pter Thanas]], with whom she had a daughter named [[Malinza Thanas|Malinza]]. However, Thanas contracted a fatal disease, [[Knowt's Disease]], and the time Captison spent caring for her ailing husband cost her in the elections.\n\nShe was widowed and out of power when Luke Skywalker returned to her life, having been sent to ask for Bakura's aid on behalf of the New Republic with regards to trouble brewing in the [[Corellian system]]. Captison helped him and later accompanied the [[Bakuran Defense Fleet|Bakuran fleet]] dispatched to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] during the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]] as a diplomat. In the final stages of the conflict, she sacrificed herself and the Bakuran [[Warship/Legends|warship]] [[Intruder (Namana-class)|''Intruder'']] to destroy a large portion of the insurgent fleet that was fighting to secede from the New Republic.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n{{Quote|She has been a good child. It remains to be seen if she'll be a good senator.|[[Orn Belden]], about Gaeriel Captison|The Truce at Bakura}}\nGaeriel Captison was born into privilege as part of the influential Bakuran [[Captison family]]. Her father [[Dol Captison]] as well as her uncle [[Yeorg Captison]] were [[Bakuran Senate|Bakuran Senators]], which sparked an interest in politics in the young Captison. Captison embraced the faith of her family and became a follower of the [[Cosmic Balance]] religion at an early age. Her life's path was decided in [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]] when her parents gave her a white feather on her [[Birthday/Legends|birthday]] to signify her road to higher education and possible senatorial election. Correspondingly, her younger sister [[Ylanda Captison|Ylanda]] received a golden bowl and immediately began a life of starvation and poverty so that the universal balance would be preserved.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nIn [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], Captison won a position in the [[Bakur Senatorial Academy]], a school aimed at preparing political-minded students for eventual positions in the [[Bakuran Senate]]. As the school was located in the Bakuran [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]], she spent her four [[Standard year/Legends|years]] at the Academy living with her uncle [[Yeorg Captison|Yeorg]] and aunt [[Tiree Captison|Tiree]]. During this time, Yeorg was elected [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister of Bakura]], and in [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], Captison was elected to the Senate&mdash;presumably either to replace the next senator who retired, or to immediately fill an open seat as soon as she graduated.<ref name=\"Databank:Gaeriel Captison\" />\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] invaded Bakura, annexing the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Captison's parents, members of the resistance, were both killed during a crossfire between Imperial and Bakuran forces. Already a follower of the Cosmic Balance, the [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of her parents left her even more spiritual.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nThe year of [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] Captison spent doing postgraduate work in government on [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]]; due to a decree by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], it was the only planet where one could do such work. When she returned to Bakura in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], she assumed a seat in the Senate, presumably one previously held by her father. Of course, Captison understood that the position was essentially meaningless with the Empire in control. However, despite what the Empire had done, she did not hate it, knowing that it brought economic growth and political stability along with its autocratic ways. During this time, she also spent a lot of time helping care for the aged and senile [[Eppie Belden]].<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\n===Ssi-ruuk threat===\n{{Quote|I'm not hiding behind Jedi abilities. I want to help the Rebellion.|Gaeriel Captison, to Luke Skywalker, after deciding to aid the Rebel Alliance|The Truce at Bakura}}\n[[File:GaerielCaptison.jpg|thumb|left|135px|Gaeriel Captison.]]\nA month after Captison became a senator, the [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Ssi-ruu]]k invaded the [[Bakura system]], with intent to conquer it and convert the populace into energy sources via [[entechment]]. During the subsequent [[Invasion of Bakura]], Captison was present when the senate was convened by the Imperial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Wilek Nereus]], who announced the arrival of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] [[Starship/Legends|ships]] in the Bakuran system. The Alliance vessels had aided the Empire in beating off a Ssi-ruuk incursion on the system, and were currently holding position near the planet. After Nereus proposed withdrawing the planetary defense forces back to Bakura and breaking off from the main battle, Captison voted with the majority to approve the action, though the vote was merely a formality.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nLater, Captison was present when a delegation from the Rebel Alliance arrived, hoping to broker a truce with the Bakurans as part of an effort to aid Bakura against the Ssi-ruuk. The Alliance delegation, which included [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], [[General/Legends|General]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], addressed the senate and Nereus, and Captison caught Skywalker's interest immediately, as he found her striking. However, when she learned that he was a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Captison was immediately off-put, as her faith held that Jedi inherently imbalanced the universe. The Rebels were shown a recording sent by the Ssi-ruuk by a Human [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] of theirs, [[Dev Sibwarra]], and were horrified to see how entechment worked; the individual's life energy was sapped from his body and used to power war machinery. The Alliance party then iterated that they were there to help Bakura and offered an official truce, which Nereus said would be discussed.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nCaptison was requested by her aunt to be present at a dinner organized by her Uncle Yeorg, the Bakuran Prime Minister, and at which both the Rebels and Nereus were invited. Captison's aunt stressed the importance of the dinner, which would give the Imperials and Rebels a chance to discuss matters privately, and also expressed concern for Nereus's interest in Captison; the latter sentiment was also held by Captison. Though her aunt had originally planned on seating Captison by Princess Organa, Yeorg had other ideas and placed her next to Luke Skywalker. Skywalker struck up a conversation with her, asking her about her preconceptions about Jedi and Captison admitted that she had religious objections to his kind. However, she remained distant and closed to him, not wanting to talk too much with him. Eventually, though, she introduced him to [[Namana|namana fruit]] nectar, a Bakuran delicacy, and asked him about the Emperor's death. He told the story, responding that the Emperor was in fact, dead, as he had felt [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] die in the Force, which also drew a negative reaction from her&mdash;the Cosmic Balance had objections to all [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-users. Midway through the dinner, Nereus received a transmission from Imperial [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Adye Prittick|Prittick]] informing him of the veracity of the Rebels' claims. Faced with the prospect of no Imperial aid to stave off a full Ssi-ruuk attack, Nereus agreed to an official truce. Following that announcement, Skywalker asked Captison how much she believed in the Empire, and she replied that it was a balance of things light and dark. As the evening wound down, Skywalker resolved to continue his conversation with her later, and kissed her hand, as he had seen other diplomats do, before departing.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nCaptison was at the Beldens' tending to Eppie Belden when Skywalker came calling, hoping to speak to Senator Belden, but the senator was otherwise occupied at the time. Captison introduced Skywalker to Eppie, and the Jedi used a [[Force healing/Legends|Force technique]] in an effort to heal Eppie's mind, which he believed had been deliberately damaged by the Empire. Captison was suspicious of him, and asked him about how he used his power. Skywalker replied that he was only trying to help, and she did soften towards him somewhat as they continued their conversation about Jedi and Eppie Belden for some time.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nNot long afterward, Captison was in her office in a futile attempt to investigate the possibility of Imperial involvement in Eppie Belden's infirmity when her aide apprised her that Nereus had planned to turn over Skywalker to the Ssi-ruuk. She decided to warn him, using the guise of visiting to his apartment as a way to tip him off. She told him about Nereus's plot, and advised him to take precautions to prevent his being captured. At the same time, she offered to have a dinner delivered to her own suite and then diverted to his apartment, and he gratefully agreed. While they waited, she asked him if he could feel her thoughts. Probing her mind with the Force, Skywalker sensed her attraction to him, despite her religious objections, and his own feelings were mutually favorable towards her. As they ate, the conversation took a more personal bent, as they discussed their pasts and personal beliefs. Skywalker voiced his interest in her, but she was still hesitant to involve herself with him, due to her faith, though she did admit her own conflicted feelings for both him and the Alliance.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nLittle did Captison or Skywalker know that Nereus had agreed to the Ssi-ruuk plan, but had double-crossed the saurian aliens by inserting [[Parasite/Legends|parasitic]] [[Olabrian trichoid]] larvae into the meal, which infected both Captison and Skywalker.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\n===Bakuran independence===\n{{Quote|Governor, if nothing else is going to come of your treachery, then I shall make my own small gesture. I resign from Imperial service.|Gaeriel Captison to Wilek Nereus|The Truce at Bakura}}\nLater, Nereus also betrayed the Rebel forces as soon as the Ssi-ruuk had been beaten back, capturing Yeorg Captison, Orn Belden, and Leia Organa. In response, the underground Bakuran resistance sprang into action and began fighting the Empire.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" /> Captison was present at the Beldens' house when the resistance sprang into action, on her way to tell Eppie about the death of her husband, who had died after being captured by the Empire on charges of sedition; he had died under interrogation. Instead, she was surprised to see a recovered Eppie Belden, successfully healed by Skywalker, leading the resistance effort and already cognizant of her husband's death. After some persuasion from Belden, Captison agreed to help the resistance. Belden gave Captison a [[Computer/Legends|computer]] chip that allowed her to access Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] communications, which she used to send fake distress calls to Imperial forces across Salis D'aar. She then destroyed the chip and went to warn Skywalker of the impending Ssi-ruuk attack.<ref name=\"TABSourcebook\">''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''</ref> Captison, aided by Skywalker's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], traced his location and were able to find him at a local [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. She warned him of the capture of the Rebels and Bakuran officials, as well as the insurrection, and asked him to come back once the conflict was over, to talk with her personally. Shortly after she arrived, though, a party of Ssi-ruuk tried to capture them with the tacit permission of Nereus. Luke attempted to fight them off, defending Captison as best he could, but was overpowered after a brief struggle. However, his efforts were not in vain and Captison, though stunned, was not taken. Instead, R2-D2 helped her out of the cantina, and she received medical attention at the Imperial garrison as the Ssi-ruuk commenced a full-scale attack.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nCaptison was taken to appear before Nereus, who had been trying to ally her with his faction in the government.<ref name=\"TABSourcebook\" /> She was initially repulsed by his mannerisms and iron-fisted plans for Bakura, but managed to maintain a diplomatic front. Nereus then revealed to her the existence of the larvae embedded in her and Skywalker's [[Lung/Legends|lungs]], and had the larva in Captison removed. Upon her questioning him, the Imperial governor also intimated that he had used a parasite to debilitate Eppie Belden years earlier as punishment for her seditious activities. She was furthermore shocked when, after the Ssi-ruuk attack had been beaten off, Nereus ordered the Imperial forces to fire on the Alliance ships. Giving her the chance to join him and approve the governor as Prime Minister, Nereus also threatened Captison should she not cooperate. He then threatened to shoot Yeorg Captison, whom he accused of treachery, unless the two yielded to his demands. However, resistance fighters led by the recovered Eppie Belden rescued Captison and captured Nereus. The latter was later killed in a desperate assassination attempt on Luke Skywalker, who had defeated the Ssi-ruuk [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] [[Sibwarra|''Shriwirr'']] and dealt with his own larvae infestation, as well as convincing the Imperial military forces to surrender.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nThe end of the battle resulted in both the repulsion of the Ssi-ruuk and the liberation of Bakura from the Empire. However, despite the mutual attraction that had developed between them, Skywalker and Captison were content to go their separate ways, the former continuing the fight against the Empire and the latter contributing to the rebuilding of Bakura. Meeting on the ''Millennium Falcon'', Captison helped Skywalker handle the body of Dev Sibwarra, who had been redeemed, and the two later shared one final kiss before they went their separate ways.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" /> She would later meet the new Bakuran defense force commander, [[Pter Thanas]], for dinner shortly after he resigned his Imperial commission to serve Bakura.<ref name=\"TABSourcebook\" />\n\nFollowing Bakura's independence, Captison was visited by her sister, Ylanda, who had been reduced to asceticism since her youth by the religious tenets of the Cosmic Balance. Captison was surprised to see how gaunt and malnourished Ylanda had become, and was even more shocked to learn from Ylanda that their parents had always been part of the resistance. Their deaths hadn't been accidental; they were ordered by the Empire. Ylanda had been told by the elder Captisons not to reveal that information to Captison unless the Empire failed her, or unless Ylanda's life was in danger. As thirty-two ascetics had recently been asked to fast for a month&mdash;in hopes that their suffering would cause the Cosmic Balance to reward Bakura with economic prosperity&mdash;Ylanda had feared she wouldn't survive the fast and had come to discharge her debt to her parents. At that point, Captison realized that she couldn't and didn't believe in the Cosmic Balance and took Ylanda in, hoping to take care of her and persuade her to abandon a faith that might have led her to self-starvation. When later interviewed by Alliance historian [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], Captison stated that she still believed that Jedi had great potential to misuse their powers, but speculated that they might exist on their own balance separate from the rest of the galaxy.<ref name=\"TABSourcebook\" />\n\n===Rise and fall===\n{{Quote|She married about six years ago, to a man called Pter Thanas&mdash;a former Imperial officer.

In [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]], Pter died.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\n===First Corellian Insurrection===\n{{Quote|I hardly know what to say, Luke. I must admit that I'd imagined seeing you again more than once over the years. But somehow I never imagined you calling on me to ask if you could borrow our navy.|Gaeriel Captison to Luke Skywalker|Assault at Selonia}}\nThe next year, Luke Skywalker returned to Bakura, requesting the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] use of the Bakuran Defense Fleet in the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]]. When the Jedi Master first arrived, Captison found that he had arranged to meet her privately first, so they could have the awkwardness of their reunion outside of public eye. The meeting was indeed uncomfortable for both of them at first, particularly since they both recalled well the feelings they had had for each other years earlier. They both expressed regret for not having seen or contacted the other in years, but realized that for them to have done so would have been disruptive to both of them. However, Skywalker informed her that he was here to discuss a pending [[Corellian Crisis|insurrection]] in the [[Corellian system]]. The New Republic was short of warships at that point, and Skywalker had come to request Bakura's aid in investigating the incident. Agreeing to help him, Captison used her clout to get the Bakuran Senate to approve the use of the Bakuran fleet.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nAfter two days of meeting with Bakura's chief military officers, including [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Hortel Ossilege]], Captison and the New Republic delegation, which included [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] officer [[Belindi Kalenda]], and Skywalker, were able to get the Prime Minister's permission to accompany a Bakuran fleet to the Corellian system. Additionally, Captison was chosen as plenipotentiary for the Bakurans, giving her authority to conduct negotiations while she accompanied the fleet. Before the fleet departed, Captison introduced her daughter to Skywalker, who said he would look out for Captison, before bidding Malinza goodbye.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nAs the fleet arrived in the Corellian system, the Bakurans found that communications and hyperspace travel were being blocked by a sizable jamming and interdiction field emanating from [[Centerpoint Station]], a space station located in between the double worlds of [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] and [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]]. The ships, using a Bakuran technology called the [[hyperwave inertial momentum sustainer]], were able to sustain hyperspace travel long enough to get them near the Corellian world of [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]]. Captison, acting as diplomatic liaison, hoped to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but as the Bakurans ventured deeper into Corellian space, the more dangerous it became for their small fleet, as a Bakuran warship was destroyed by a hidden [[planetary repulsor]] in the opening engagement over the world of [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]] between the Bakurans and insurrectionist forces.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nCaptison later accompanied a small mission to Centerpoint Station, along with Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], and Belindi Kalenda. They were unsuccessful in finding a way to stop the station though, as the only crew member on the station, [[Jenica Sonsen]], was clueless to the fact that the station was in fact, a superweapon. Sonsen told them that the station had been largely abandoned when destructive flares started consuming the inside of the station. The mission took a nearly lethal turn when, while investigating the remains of the [[Hollowtown]] settlement, the environment rapidly grew hostile and toxic to [[Human/Legends|Humans]], increasing in temperature and with an increasingly poisonous atmospheric composition. The group narrowly survived by escaping into an elevator car out the area. They returned to the Bakuran fleet, but their mission was a success in that Calrissian determined that Centerpoint was the key to the insurrection and a superweapon capable of destroying stars. Upon returning to their ships, they soon learned that the [[Sacorrian Triad]] was bringing a large fleet to combat the Bakurans.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\n[[File:Gaeriel_CTD.jpg|thumb|left|Captison in [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]].]]\nAs the Republic and Bakuran forces prepared for combat, Captison opted to remain on the [[Intruder (Namana-class)|''Intruder'']] with commanding [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Hortel Ossilege]]. Her negotiating powers were useless in a shooting conflict, and she was relegated to waiting on the ship for the duration of the battle. She did have the opportunity of welcoming New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo to the ''Intruder'', as Organa Solo had been on the run from Corellian insurrectionists for some time, and also witnessed her reunification with her children, who had been kidnapped before escaping. Staying on the ''Intruder'' was a fatal error on her part, however, for Captison (along with half the Bakuran fleet) perished at the resulting [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|Battle of Centerpoint Station]]. In particular, the ''Intruder'' was critically damaged after being hit by robotic ramships. The damage also left her and Admiral Ossilege mortally wounded, so while the rest of the crew abandoned the ship, they set off the self-destruct in order to take some Corellian ships with it. Luke ensured Malinza's adoption into a wealthy Bakuran family, and returned to visit the orphan several times.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" /><ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The New Republic dragged her into a war she wasn't part of, and she gave her life to save others.
