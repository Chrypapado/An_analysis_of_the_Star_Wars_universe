Circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], the [[Genarius]]-based [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Salld Nrump]] discovered evidence of the existence of three [[data transmitter]]s that were being used by the [[Metatheran Cartel]] to covertly gather information in the [[Cularin system]], and he contacted Krol-Pek to discuss his findings. Shortly afterward, Nrump went on the run from the [[Red Fury Brotherhood/Legends|Red Fury Brotherhood]], a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] organization that sought to use the transmitter for it's own purposes, and Krol-Pek arranged passage for Nrump to Cularin, aboard the [[Transport/Legends|transport]] ''[[The Panada's Kiss]]''. However, Nrump was subsequently [[Death/Legends|murdered]] by [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] hired by the Brotherhood, and some [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] traveled to Cularin in Nrump's place and rendezvoused with Krol-Pek.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Quarters]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cereans]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
