They're usually loitering around on the outskirts of the city. If you find anything about Tomi or my missing shipment, please follow it through.|Ral Mundi, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Tomi Jinsin was a thug, member of the [[Ragtags|Ragtag gang]]. At some point, he also got an official job in [[Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium]], a shipwright company in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]].<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> Jinsin used his position to allow the Ragtags to steal a large shipment of starship components. The robbery put the company on the verge of bankrupt, forcing [[Ral Mundi]] to requested intervention of the [[Corellian Security Force]]. CorSec [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper]] sent a spacer who finally discovered the truth about the missing shipment. Tomi Jinsin went into hiding in a [[Ragtag bunker|bunker]] near Coronet but the spacer tracked him down there. Jinsin was killed while trying to resist to the spacer. From information found in Tomi Jinsin's datapad, the spacer was able to retrieve the missing shipment in the [[Coronet Capitol]], along with a crate of illegal [[Spice/Legends|spice]].<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\" /> Further investigation of the CorSec about the shipment robbery and the smuggled spice would led to the discovery of a plot of the [[Rogue CorSec]] to overthrow the [[Diktat]] [[Daclif Gallamby]] himself.<ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Receive the Thanks of a Grateful Diktat|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTomi Jinsin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\" /> The game was shut down on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nTomi Jinsin was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 21 Notes for 4 August 2005|Publish 21]]\", on [[August 4]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref> He was part of the quest named \"Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components\", best known as \"Ral Mundi's quest\".<ref name=\"SWG:TTE\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=other}}Quest: \"Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components\"</ref> Ral Mundi's quest was revamped with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 27 Notes for February 15th, 2006|Publish 27]]\", on [[February 15]], [[2006]],<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 27|archivedate=20060217101736}}</ref> as the quest was inserted into the \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]]\", the main questline in the game.<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Total Experience}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Reacquire the Missing Starship Component Shipment}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jinsin, Tomi}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
