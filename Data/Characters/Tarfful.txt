During the war, he led a band of Wookiees to answer a distress signal made by [[Chewbacca]], who was imprisoned on the [[Trandoshan]] hunting grounds of [[Wasskah]]. Tarfful later participated in the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]] alongside Chewbacca and [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. In the wake of [[Order 66]] and the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], Tarrful helped facilitate Yoda's escape and continued fighting against the tyranny of the Empire in the following years.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Good-bye, Tarfful.

There, Chewbacca managed to build a device which sent a [[distress signal]] to Kashyyyk. Upon hearing of his friend's situation, Tarfful hired the [[bounty hunter]]s [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]] and [[Seripas]] to [[transport]] him and a group of his most trusted [[Soldier|warriors]] to Wasskah.
