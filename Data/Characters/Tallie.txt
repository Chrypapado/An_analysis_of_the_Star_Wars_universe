Tallie and sibling [[Nahk]] were kidnapped by [[Brejik]] and [[Griff Vao]]. The two kidnappers didn't get the chance to ask for a ransom with the break out of riots on the planet stemming from the escape of [[Zayne Carrick]] and the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] pulling out of the planet.\n\nThe two siblings were found when Griff's little sister, [[Mission Vao|Mission]], and Zayne, who had just returned to Taris, were spying on Griff bringing food to a storage bin in the Lower City. [[Gadon Thek]], leader of the [[Hidden Beks]], returned the children to their mother to get aid from and to help the [[Taris Resistance|resistance]] against the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] who had [[Taris Siege|invaded and taken over the planet]].\n\nWhen the Mandalorians began attacking the Resistance, Noana sent the children to their father on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. Noana would later fall victim to the [[Rakghoul plague]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen writing the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Knights of Suffering|''Knights of Suffering'']] story arc, [[John Jackson Miller]] had considered taking his own children's names and working them into those of Nahk and Tallie. However, when he started writing [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Vector|the next story arc]], he realized that their mother, Noana Sowrs, would be turning into a [[rakghoul]] and decided against basing the children on his own, giving the characters different names.<ref>{{Faraway|blog/2010/02/12/kotor-countdown-10-naming-of-knights|KOTOR Countdown #10: The Naming of Knights|archivedate=20200823143514}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 22|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 22]] {{1st}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 23|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 23]] {{1stID}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 25]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 29]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tallie Sowrs\n|pl=Tallie\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
