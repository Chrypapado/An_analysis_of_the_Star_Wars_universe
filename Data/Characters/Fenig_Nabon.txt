Nabon's partner was a [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] woman named [[Ghitsa Dogder]], and together they owned a ship called the ''[[Star Lady]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Fen was adopted by the compassionate smuggler [[Jett Nabon]], who found her living in the streets of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]] making her living as a pickpocket. He took her under his wing and taught her the trade of smuggling. Before she was fifteen, she had been to [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on several occasions.\n\nIn [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Nabon and Dogder teamed up with the [[Mistryl Shadow Guard|Mistryls]] [[Shada D'ukal]] and [[Dunc T'racen]] to deliver a troupe of [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] female dancers from the [[Clan Shak]] on [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] to [[Durga Besadii Tai|Durga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. Along the way they ran into the [[Karazak Slavers Cooperative]] in the [[Naps Fral Cluster]]. During this time Ghitsa speculated that Fenig nursed a secret crush for fellow Corellian and former smuggler [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], even going so far as to suggest why the ''Star Lady'' had a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]-sized bed on board.\n\nFenig often regretted having taken on such a partner, but when Dogder was abducted sometime around [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]] while the pair was on the planet [[Prishardia]] by [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] operatives seeking information she might have about a rival Hutt's operations, Nabon was able to rescue her with the aid of the self-exiled [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Kyp Durron]] who, in the aftermath of his destruction of the [[Carida/Legends|Carida]] system, was going by the alias of [[Zeth Fost]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|2|A Credit for Your Thoughts}}\n*''[[Hutt and Seek]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Simple Tricks]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Under ''Kyp Durron''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fenig Nabon\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabon, Fenig}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
