She was [[Shimkif]]'s daughter, and posed as the daughter of [[Haplif]].\n\nWhile living among the [[Chiss]] on [[Celwis]], Frosif became friends with [[Xodlak'phr'ooa|Lakphro]]'s daughter, [[Lakris]]. One day, Lakris wanted to convince Frosif that she had the [[telepathy|telepathic]] ability to summon [[growzer]]s. Unbeknownst to Lakris, Frosif and other Agbui actually possessed such abilities. Lakris had trained her growzer to come when called by the sound of a brass zipper, which the young Chiss claimed on many occasions to be a telepathic ability.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nWhen Lakris performed the \"telepathic call\" trick with her growzer for Frosif, the Agbui girl had an unexpected post-traumatic episode. Frosif's panic attack led [[Xodlak'phr'ooa|Lakphro]] to become suspicious of the Agbui's origins. Lakphro asked [[Senior Aide]] [[Xodlak'ji'iprip|Lakjip]] to investigate the girl's trauma response. It turned out that the brass zipper's sound was similar to the explosion of [[flat-blast artillery shell]]s. Unbeknownst to any of the Chiss, Frosif's traumatic episode was a flashback to the time the Agbui had spent on [[Sunrise]], where [[Haplif]] had instigated a disastrous [[Sunrise civil war|civil war]]. Haplif pushed both sides of the war into using that kind of artillery shells, thus giving his alleged daughter a traumatic trigger.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of Frosif's panic attack, Haplif gave Lakris and her [[Parent|mother]] [[Lakansu]] [[nyix]] brooches to apologize, and to thank the family for hosting them. This led Lakphro to become even more suspicious of the Agbui, perceiving the valuable gifts as a bribe.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nLike other [[Agbui]], Frosif possessed a touch-based form of [[telepathy]]. Frosif was frequently able to read the emotional state of Lakris, but rarely able to read the girl's father Lakphro. This led Haplif to become angry with Frosif.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Agbui]]\n[[Category:Celwis residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Grysk Hegemony individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
