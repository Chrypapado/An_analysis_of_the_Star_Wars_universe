However, when Zak, [[Hale Malcolm]], [[Dahl Harris]], and the farming settlers provided Master Vossan the coordinates of the Sand People's camp, the Jedi Master fell to [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Parkanas Tark|Vivicar's]] plague and went insane. This caused him to turn against the settlers as he sent the Tusken warriors to attack the farming settlement. Zak and the farming settlers were angry that Vossan betrayed them until they encountered another [[The Barsen'thor|Jedi]]. They were very aggressive toward the Jedi, but the [[Jedi Consular]] convinced the farmers to provide Vossan's location.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davies, Zak}}\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
