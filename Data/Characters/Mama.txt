She was the mother of [[Ebor]], [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]], and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's father]]. She was also the grandmother of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]], and the great-grandmother of [[Rotta]] and [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo|Gorga]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Elder Hutt===\nMama, an elder Hutt,<ref name=\"HFZ\" /> was [[Reproduction|born]] sometime before 1021 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]],<ref name=\"Birth note\" /> and sometime after became the wife of [[Papa]].<ref name=\"HFZ\" /> Together, they had three children: [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure]], [[Ebor]], and another [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's father|male child]].<ref name=\"Super Graphic\">''[[Star Wars Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to a Galaxy Far, Far Away]]''</ref> However, Ebor would eventually [[Death|die]]. She was also the grandmother of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], and the great-grandmother of Jabba's son [[Rotta]], and his nephew [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo]]. At some point before the start of the [[Clone Wars]], Papa ran away, later dying and being buried on [[Teth]]. This information was known only to Ziro, who didn't have the heart to tell his mother that Papa had perished.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\n===Hunt for Ziro===\nYears later, during the Clone Wars, Ziro was broken out of [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[Prison]] during a hostage situation brought on by the [[Bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]], who had been hired by the [[Grand Hutt Council]] to liberate Ziro, due to the information he held on them, incriminating files on all the nefarious dealings of the Council over the years. Having been taken to [[Nal Hutta]] by Bane, Ziro was held by the Council while they decided what to do with him. During this time, Ziro's ex-lover [[Sy Snootles]] broke him out, and fleeing [[Gardulla]] and the Council, Ziro sought refuge at his old home, reuniting with Mama. Mama was not pleased to see him, having not seen him for years, only for him to return at dinner time. Despite Ziro claiming he was happy to see her again, Mama saw through his false flattery and simply asked him what he wanted. Ziro wanted to trade his [[Infantry Support Platform|Swamp Speeder]] for Mama's [[Starship]], citing that Gardulla was after him. Mama decided to let Ziro take the ship, and Ziro and Snootles headed for Teth.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\nNot long after their departure, Cad Bane and his droid [[Todo 360]] arrived at the home, demanding to know where Ziro had gone. Mama pointed them in the direction of Teth, and they left after Ziro. No sooner than the Bounty Hunters had left, Mama had her third visitors for the night, two [[Jedi]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Quinlan Vos]], who were also hunting Ziro. Mama was displeased with Quinlan's entrance into her home, the Jedi having broken down her door. Nethertheless, she helped the two Jedi, telling them that Ziro was headed for Teth. The two Jedi then left, Mama calling back to them, wanting her door repaired. Ziro would die on Teth, betrayed and murdered by Snootles, both Bane and the Jedi too late to claim Ziro for themselves. Ziro' death left Mama the last one left of their family.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAccording to her son Ziro, Mama was at her happiest when she was miserable.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Mama was partly inspired by the character Pearl, a massively obese [[Wikipedia:Vampire (Marvel Comics)|Vampire]] from the [[1998]] superhero film [[Wikipedia:Blade (film)|''Blade'']].<ref name=\"Trivia\">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/hunt-for-ziro-trivia-gallery|text=Hunt for Ziro Trivia Gallery}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode309.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Hunt for Ziro|archivedate=20110902135103}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' The Complete Season Three]]\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/hunt-for-ziro-episode-guide|text=\"Hunt for Ziro\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Jabba the Hutt and Other Bounty Hunters and Criminals}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Mama\n|fr=Mama\n|ja=\u30de\u30de\n|ka=\u10d3\u10d4\u10d3\u10d0\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
