The pirate ruler of Wild Space! The glorious knave, Eleodie Maracavanya!|[[Vinthar]], reciting a speech to a group captured by Maracavanya's pirates|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Eleodie Maracavanya''' was a [[Gender|non-binary]] [[pirate]] ruler after the fall of the [[Galactic Empire]] who led zher pirate crew to take control of the [[Liberty's Misrule|''Annihilator'']], a [[Super Star Destroyer]] that once belonged to the Imperial [[Grand General]] [[Cassio Tagge]], which they renamed ''Liberty's Misrule''. With this [[Starship|vessel]] under zher control, Maracavanya came to be known as the \"pirate ruler of [[Wild Space]].\"\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\n[[File:Annihilator_Executor-class_SWA.png|thumb|right|250px|The ''Annihilator'', before it was captured by Eleodie Maracavanya]]\nEleodie Maracavanya grew up on the [[moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Zhe was once a [[Slavery|slave]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] but later became a [[pirate]]. Following the [[Battle of Endor]], Eleodie became the leader of pirate gang based in [[Wild Space]]. Zher underlings included the [[Omwati]] [[Shi Shu]], [[Vinthar]] the [[Sarkan]] of [[Egg-Brood Xazin'nizar]], and several [[Weequay]] pirates. Eleodie and zher gang took over the [[Super Star Destroyer]] [[Liberty's Misrule|''Annihilator'']],<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> the former [[flagship]] of the Imperial [[Grand General]] [[Cassio Tagge]].<ref name=\"Vader 2\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 2|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 2]]</ref> Eleodie established a pirate [[Politics|empire]] based aboard a [[flotilla]] of [[Starship|ships]] that included the former Imperial Super [[Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Meeting Kartessa===\nIn [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Life Debt date\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Eleodie's ''Annihilator'' boarded a [[New Republic]] [[CR90 corvette]] called the ''[[Starfall]]''. The ship was carrying a diplomatic mission led by [[Senator]] [[Tia'dor Emshwa]], which was traveling on a mission to the planet [[Ithor]] to recruit the world to the nascent [[The galaxy|galactic]] government. ''Starfall'' was carrying reclaimed [[Ithorian]] artifacts, food, medicine, and a bounty of technology.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n[[File:Flash_Grenade_DICE.png|thumb|left|200px|Flash grenades were used to pacify the passengers and crew aboard the ''Starfall''.]]\nEleodie supervised the boarding with zher second-in-command Shi Shu, who informed zher about the ship. While Eleodie was reluctant to pick a fight with the New Republic, zhe accepted Shi Shu's explanation that plundering the ''Starfall'' would replenish their flotilla's supplies. After disabling the ship's comm array and sealing the breaching airlock, Eleodie and Vinthar commanded the boarding of the ''Starfall''. After the pirates pacified the crew and passengers with [[flash grenade]]s and [[flash detonator]]s, Vinthar told Eleodie to board the ship and meet the captives.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nEleodie waited as Vinthar addressed the captives with a short speech. After displaying zher [[electro-scythe]], Eleodie used a [[Vocabulator|vocoder]] to speak in a decipherable way to the ''Starfall''{{'s}} crew and passengers. Eleodie identified zherself as the captain of the ''Annihilator'' but vowed to rename the ship. Zhe promised to spare the lives of the captives if they did not resist but expropriated their ship and its cargo. Since zhe was no murderer and slaver, Eleodie gave them the chance to flee into the ''Starfall''{{'s}} [[escape pod]]s.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThough Eleodie did not impress crew into zher services, zhe still sought to recruit the ''Starfall''{{'s}} crew and passengers into zher services voluntarily. Zhe promised that they would enjoy a life of spoils and riches as pirates and mocked the New Republic. To zher surprise, a young [[Chandrilan]] woman named [[Kartessa]] took up the offer. The youth wanted a life of adventure and did not want to be cloistered on [[Chandrila]] anymore. The [[Kartessa's mother|woman's mother]] objected but Eleodie told her to respect her daughter's decision. The woman reluctantly agreed to follow her daughter and join Eleodie's pirate empire. Eleodie then allowed the remaining crew and passengers to leave aboard escape pods.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Liberty's Misrule===\nIn the [[Standard month|months]] leading up to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Eleodie later renamed the ''Annihilator'' the ''Liberty's Misrule''. Zhe also became the leader of the self-proclaimed [[Sovereign Latitudes of Maracavanya]], a nation of pirates and criminals which numbered ten thousand. The Super Star [[Destroyer]] became the center of Eleodie's new nation. Eleodie's Sovereign Latitudes was replenished by stolen ships and pirates and refugees who had fled into [[Wild Space]]. These pirates and refugees built ramshackle homes and markets in the Super Star Destroyer's [[hangar]] bays. Eleodie also found a new confidante in the form of Kartessa, the rebellious teenage girl zhe had encountered on the ''Starfall''.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWhen Kartessa revealed that she had abandoned her [[Parent|mother]] on the engineering sublevel for not leaving her alone, Eleodie chastised the girl for disrespecting her mother. After a few minutes of scuffing her heels, Kartessa asked Eleodie how zher pirate nation would work out. Eleodie explained that it was better for the pirates to band together than to fight and kill each other for scraps. Karteesa pointed out that zhe had not answered her question and that pirates were naturally selfish. Eleodie countered that pirates had a mutual benefit for working together. Zhe reassured her that they would kill less because of the threat of their numbers. Eleodie also vowed to share the spoils equally.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n[[File:ISDIIESB.png|thumb|250px|right|An ''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]]\nThe two were interrupted by Shi Shu who informed them that they had visitors. These visitors turned out to be three [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyers]] that had fled the Battle of [[Jakku]]. The [[Ssori]] [[Gunner]] [[Carklin Ryoon]] and Shi Shu suggested tricking the Imperials and [[Destruction of Imperial Star Destroyers|stealing]] their ships. However, Eleodie ordered zher crew to destroy them and send their pieces to the New Republic in order to curry the new government's favor. Zhe proposed charging the New Republic for their clean-up.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWhen Kartessa countered that the New Republic was not their friend, Eleodie responded that destroying the Star Destroyers could give them some leverage in their dealings with the Republic. When Kartessa added that the ships had considerable firepower, Eleodie promised to repay the other fleet captains for any damage. After Shi Shu ordered the rest of the bridge crew to activate the targeting computers, weapons systems, and tractor beam, Kartessa asked Eleodie if zhe knew what zhe was doing. Eleodie admitted zhe was taking a leap into the unknown and likened life to a pair of dice. The ''Liberty's Misrule'' wiped out the weakened Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Girl, it's like this: The sea is changing, and the tides are shifting. It's about to get real nasty for us nasty types. Either we're gonna be running from the new sheriff in town, or we're gonna be trying to kill each other in the farthest-flung dung-heap systems, stabbing each other over a few scraps of what was once ours by right.

So I'm making it official.|Eleodie's vision of the Sovereign Latitudes of Maracavanya, a pirate nation|Aftermath: Empire's End}}\nEleodie Maracavanya was a [[Gender|non-binary]] individual whose pronouns were primarily \"zhe,\" \"zher,\" and \"zherself,\" while occasionally alternating those with \"his\" or \"her;\" zhe most notably did this in zher introductory speech, delivered by Vinthar but written by zher, which referred to zherself as \"his highness, her glory.\" Eleodie had [[gold]]-[[color]]ed eyes and fingertips. Zher natural voice was loud and alive, vibrating with deep intensity, but zhe spoke with a vocoder that modified zher voice to make it velvety and rich.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nEleodie was an opportunistic pirate leader who wanted to take advantage of the slow death of the Empire following the Battle of Endor. Zhe was skeptical of the New Republic and believed that the foundling government had little chance of saving the galaxy. Eleodie sought to create a new pirate state based on freedom, greed, and self-interest. Zhe admired a rebellious young Chandrilan girl named Karteesa who joined zher crew out of a desire for adventure and to spite her mother.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nEleodie believed that pirates should work together for their mutual benefit. Zher vision led the pirate to create a pirate nation known as the Sovereign Latitudes of Maracavanya. Eleodie believed in sharing the spoils of zher catch equally among zher underlings. Zhe was also politically shrewd and sought to gain leverage with the New Republic by destroying Imperial Star Destroyers. Despite identified as a pirate and criminal, Eleodie still had some moral decency and chastised Kartessa for abandoning her mother in the engineering deck. Zhe also had philosophical discussions with the young woman and kept her appraised of developments.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:AftermathLifeDebt-Hardcover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The cover of ''Aftermath: Life Debt'']]\nEleodie Maracavanya was a secondary point-of-view character who first appeared in an interlude chapter in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', the second installment in [[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy|''The Aftermath Trilogy'']].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Wendig confirmed via [[Wikipedia:Twitter|Twitter]] that his use of [[Wikipedia:Gender neutrality in languages with gendered third-person pronouns|gender-neutral pronouns]] indicated<ref name=\"Wendig Tweet pronouns\">{{Twitter|chuckwendig|status/1007345075343552513|[[Chuck Wendig]]|quote=That would be the gender-neutral / non-binary pronoun used by human space pirate Eleodie Maracavanya.|image=File:EleodiePronounTweet.png|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030052518/https://twitter.com/ChuckWendig/status/1007345075343552513}}</ref> the character is [[Wikipedia:Genderqueer|non-binary]].<ref name=\"Wendig Tweet NB\">{{Twitter|chuckwendig|status/887340489736949760|[[Chuck Wendig]]|quote=Just to gently correct \u2014 Eleodie is not asexual, but rather, NB, or gender non-binary.|archivedate=20181102185405|image=File:Wendig_on_Eleodie.png}}</ref> This gave the character the distinction of being the first non-binary character in the current ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]].<ref name=\"DJO Tweet NB\">{{Twitter|djolder|status/986264396384100353|[[Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older]]|quote=Thank you!
