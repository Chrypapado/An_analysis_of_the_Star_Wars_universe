A warning of a great plague spreading across our planet! Please, listen to me!|Colu|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Gorton Colu''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. He was the creator of the [[Anti-Alien League]], an organization that lobbied for the [[Death/Legends|slaughter]] of all [[Alien/Legends|non-Humans]] living on Taris, and spent time in the [[Upper City]] promoting his beliefs. In [[3956 BBY]], Colu met with [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] [[Carth Onasi]] and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and attempted to convince them to join his cause.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Listen, friend, for these are dark times. That is why I, Gorton Colu, have formed the Anti-Alien League. The time has come for action! We cannot sit idly by while aliens blight our glorious planet!|Colu|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGorton Colu was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. An elderly man<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> by [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"CG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> he was the founder of the [[Anti-Alien League]], an organization dedicated to the eradication of all [[Alien/Legends|non-Human]] [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]] on Taris. Having obtained all proper permits to spread his message from the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] who were governing the planet at the time, Colu spent some of his time in the north of the [[Upper City]], publicly voicing his opinions and advertising his league to all who would stop to listen. He made particular mention of [[Species/Legends|species]] such as [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]], [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorians]], [[Rodian/Legends|Rodians]], and [[Bith/Legends|Bith]], all of whom he described as hideous. However, he was dismissed as a madman by most of the civilian population.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn 3956 BBY,<ref name=\"CG\" /> Colu was approached in the Upper [[City/Legends|City]] by [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]]. Colu told the duo about his beliefs, asking them to join the League and spread the word of an impending \"day of reckoning\" to others. Revan later returned with two of his companions&mdash;[[Zaalbar]], a Wookiee, and [[Mission Vao]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]]. Both non-Humans taunted Colu, enraging him with their very presence.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You are like all the rest! You will not see the truth! On the day of reckoning you will suffer with the rest of the alien lovers!|Colu|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nColu was extremely [[Speciesism|speciecist]], believing that all non-Humans were a plague upon his beautiful [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Taris. He thought that the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] would support his campaign to exterminate all aliens and make Humans who tolerated their existence suffer for their ignorance. He eagerly awaited a \"day of reckoning,\" when Taris would be rid of aliens, but feared that continued inaction would lead to Taris becoming irreversibly overrun. Even though most of the general public disliked non-Humans, they considered Colu crazy, and wondered why the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] hadn't yet [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] him.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|You're right! We should slaughter the whole bunch of them!''\"<br />\"''Yes, my fellow human! You have seen the light! Gorton Colu has marked your face&mdash;I will remember you when the time to destroy the aliens and the alien-lovers is upon us!|Revan and Colu, in a possible dialogue option|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGorton Colu appears as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', in which the player, Revan, can interact with him. The player can either choose to side with Colu and join the Anti-Alien League or call Colu crazy. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Lastly, if Revan or a companion is wearing a stolen Sith uniform when talking to Colu, the old man offers a friendly greeting to his \"Sith friends\" and assures them he has the proper permits to be speaking where he is. In that case, Revan does not speak directly to Colu at all. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with Colu and, if so, what form the conversation took.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gorton Colu#legends\n|es=Gorton Colu\n|pl=Gorton Colu\n|ru=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0443\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Colu, Gorton}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
