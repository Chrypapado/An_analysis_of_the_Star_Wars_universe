They were inspired by it, Ezra. They rallied others to rise up and break out.|Ryder Azadi tells Ezra Bridger about how his parents were inspired by his message|Legacy (episode)}}\n'''Mira Bridger''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] from the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] of [[Lothal]] who was an outspoken opponent of the rule of the [[Galactic Empire]]. She and her [[Marriage|husband]], [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]], broadcast underground revolutionary messages against the Empire, and these actions were supported by Lothal's [[governor]], [[Ryder Azadi]]. Because of their broadcasts, the Bridgers and Azadi were arrested and [[Prison|imprisoned]] by the Empire. This left their son, [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]], to fend for himself on Lothal for nearly a [[Standard decade|decade]].\n\nWhile in prison, Mira and Ephraim eventually learned that Ezra had become part of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that fought against the Empire on Lothal. They heard a [[Ezra's broadcast|message of rebellion]] that he broadcast to Lothal and nearby [[star system]]s, a broadcast that inspired them to fight for their freedom from Imperial activity. Mira and her husband led a [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|prison revolt]] that led to dozens of [[prisoner]]s escaping, but Mira and Ephraim were [[Death|killed]] during the escape.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Bridger_family.png|thumb|left|200px|The Bridger family, before Mira and Ephraim's arrests]]\nMira Bridger was [[Marriage|married]] to [[Ephraim Bridger]] and the two had one son, [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]], who was born on the day that the [[Galactic Empire]] [[Proclamation of the New Order|rose to power]]. When the Empire took control of the Bridger's [[homeworld]] of [[Lothal]], a [[planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], Mira and Ephraim became outspoken opponents of its rule, and the earliest rebels in the system.<ref name=\"Empire Day\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref> In [[14 BBY]]<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> they began to broadcast underground messages that spoke out against the Empire,<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> and these revolutionary tactics were supported by Lothal's [[governor]], [[Ryder Azadi]].<ref name=\"Legacy\" /> These activities led the Empire to send [[stormtrooper]]s after them,<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref> and the Bridgers, along with the governor, were arrested for treason.<ref name=\"Legacy\" /> A close friend of the Bridgers, a [[Rodian]] named [[Tseebo]], promised to watch over Ezra, but he became fearful of the Empire and failed to look out for the boy. This left Ezra, only seven years old, to live on his own for the better part of a [[Standard decade|decade]].<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nSeveral years later, while still in [[prison]], Mira and Ephraim learned that Ezra was part of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that fought against the [[Imperial Military]] on Lothal. He transmitted a [[Ezra's broadcast|message of rebellion]] to Lothal's citizens, urging them to stand up and fight for their freedom. This message traveled all across the galaxy, reaching and inspiring so many people, and finally made its way to the prison where the Bridgers were held. Mira and Ephraim, who for years had tried to help their fellow [[prisoner]]s, knew that the voice was that of their son's because his words mirrored their own from so many years prior. Inspired by what Ezra said, Mira and Ephraim organized a [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|prison break]] that led to dozens of prisoners, including Azadi, escaping to freedom. The Bridgers, however, were separated during the escape, and they refused to leave until everyone else had escaped. By the time their fellow prisoners were free, Mira and Ephraim had already been killed.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The Jedi teach that life doesn't cease at death, but merely changes form in the Force. Your parents are alive inside you, Ezra. They will be. Always.|Kanan Jarrus, Ezra's master|Legacy (episode)}}\nFor years, while his parents were in captivity, Ezra did not want to know what happened to them, as he believed he would not be able to survive on his own if he held out hope that Mira and Ephraim would one day return to him. He did finally start to learn answers after encountering Tseebo, who went to work for the [[Imperial Information Office]] and stole critical information in the hopes of making up for his failure to help Ezra. Ezra did not initially learn what Tseebo knew about the Bridgers' captivity,<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" /> but the boy later learned about it from his [[Jedi]] teacher, [[Kanan Jarrus]], and rebel [[captain]] [[Hera Syndulla]]. This revelation coincided with a [[Force vision|vision]] of his parents that he received at the same time they were killed. The vision led him back to Lothal, which he and the rebels previously abandoned.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_sees_his_parents_through_the_Force.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra sees his parents through the Force]]\nIt was on Lothal that Ezra found Azadi, who had also returned in the hopes of finding Ezra so he could tell the boy what happened to Mira and Ephraim. Azadi explained what happened during the prison revolt and Ezra was grateful to know the truth, but he was nonetheless heartbroken by the loss of his parents. Soon after learning of their fates, he had another vision where he saw Mira and Ephraim through the Force, telling him that they were proud of him and urging him to remain strong. Ezra did not understand, at first, how he could see his parents, but Jarrus told him that the Jedi taught how life did not end at death but merely transformed into something new in [[the Force]]. Mira and Ephraim would always be with him, even if he could not see them.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nIn [[0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Women of the Galaxy\">''[[Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy]]''</ref> during the [[Liberation of Lothal]], Ezra was welcomed aboard the ''[[Chimaera]]'' to talk with [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] about an offer he wanted to make.

However, Ezra realized that it was just a lie because he sensed his parents' death and turned down Palpatine's offer before calling the [[purrgil]] to remove [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn's]] Imperial forces from Lothal.<ref name=\"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMira Bridger was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] with [[Color|purple]] [[eye]]s and tan skin, and she wore a headpiece that covered her head. She was an outspoken opponent of the Empire's rule of Lothal, leading to her arrest and imprisonment with her husband. Even in prison, however, the Bridgers continued to stand up for other people, up until the point that they were killed in the prison revolt that they led so others could gain their freedom.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMira Bridger was first heard, and pictured in a [[hologram]], in \"[[Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day]]\" and \"[[Gathering Forces]],\" episodes of the [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
