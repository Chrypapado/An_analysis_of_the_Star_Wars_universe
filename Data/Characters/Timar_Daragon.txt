Shields damaged!|Timar Daragon, during the Battle of Kirrek|Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0}}\n'''Timar Daragon''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Starship/Legends|starship]] [[Pilot/Legends|operator]] during the years leading up to the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. The wife of fellow pilot [[Hok Daragon]], Daragon was the mother of [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]], and worked as a supply runner during the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]] of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]] with Hok in their ship, the ''[[Shadow Runner]]''. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], the Daragons took a mission to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kirrek]] during a [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|battle]] to run supplies to [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta's]] besieged forces on the world. However, the ''Shadow Runner'' was destroyed by [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] forces, [[Death/Legends|killing]] both Hok and Timar Daragon on impact. After their deaths, the Daragons' other ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', was bequeathed to Gav and Jori, who later became [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] explorers.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Too dangerous, kids.|Timar Daragon, refusing her children's request to accompany her to Kirrek|Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0}}\nTimar Daragon, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], was [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to [[Hok Daragon]]. Together, they had two children, [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], during the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|First Unification Wars]] in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]], the political leader known as [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]] attempted to unify the seven [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] of the [[Star system/Legends|system]]. During this time, the Daragons worked as supply runners to Teta's forces in their ship, the ''[[Shadow Runner]]''. Teta's forces managed to unify six of the Koros system's seven worlds into one union. The only planet in the system yet to be unified with the others was [[Kirrek]], where a man named [[Llaban]] had put together an [[Army/Legends|army]] of rebels and [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]]. Teta's forces were surprised by the ferocity of Llaban's army, and found themselves besieged in a citadel. The Daragons then went to [[Aarrba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], who ran a [[Aarrba's Repair Dock|service dock]] in the Koros system [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]], to get the ''Shadow Runner'' spaceworthy so as to bring relief supplies to the soldiers on Kirrek. The Daragons were grateful for Aarrba's services, and in exchange, the Hutt decided to keep the Daragons' other ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', as a collateral until they returned. Although Gav and Jori asked their parents if they could assist them on their mission, both Timar and Hok believed that their upcoming mission was too dangerous, so Gav and Jori were forced to stay behind.<ref name=\"totj\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|battle]] on Kirrek continued, with the Tetan forces receiving aid from two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] in Teta's service, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Memit Nadill]] and the [[Draethos (species)|Draethos]] scholar [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]]. On Odan-Urr's suggestion, the two made use of an exotic [[Force power/Legends|Force power]] known as [[battle meditation]], which allowed the Jedi to demoralize the pirate forces and lift the spirits of the Tetan fighters. Desperate, the pirates began to [[Laser/Legends|fire]] on the weakest incoming targets, hoping to eliminate as many as they could before they were defeated. The ''Shadow Runner'' reached Kirrek soon after this order was given, and the ship was promptly set upon by the pirate gun turrets. The Daragons decided to fly in low and fast so as to drop their cargo and get out of the war zone as quickly as possible, but the ''Shadow Runner''{{'s}} evasive action was hindered by the cargo's weight. Caught in a crossfire, the ''Shadow Runner'' was destroyed, and both of the Daragons were [[Death/Legends|killed]]. The Tetan forces ultimately won the battle, and Teta succeeded in unifying the whole of the Koros system. After the Daragons' death, Aarrba gave Gav and Jori the ''Starbreaker 12'', and the two vowed to honor their parents by exploring the galaxy.<ref name=\"totj\" /> This proved to be a pivotal moment in [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|history]], as Gav and Jori eventually took a blind [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] jump and discovered the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], sparking the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]].<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTimar Daragon was a daring individual, accepting a very dangerous mission to Kirrek while knowing full well of the risks, but quickly panicked when attacked by the pirates. Daragon cared greatly for her children and was mindful of their safety, refusing to allow them to accompany her and Hok to Kirrek on the grounds that it was too dangerous. Both she and Hok were considered skilled pilots by their children.<ref name=\"totj\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTimar Daragon made her first and only appearance in [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 0]].
