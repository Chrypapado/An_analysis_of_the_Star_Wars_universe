He took [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]] as his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] and trained him to be a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. At some point, he met [[Klis Joo]], a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] female who was a Jedi in training at that time.<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[119 BBY]], Ziveri became the Headmaster of the [[Almas Academy]] as it grew from a small school to a full Academy where he taught the [[Living Force/Legends|Living Force]]. Though some wondered at putting an Academy so close to such a powerful [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] site as the [[Almas Sith fortress]], Ziveri felt it would be a constant reminder to students of the dangers of the dark side. Every year, he recounted the tale of [[Kibh Jeen]] and the [[Dark Jedi Conflict]] to the students, though he eventually had older students take over this duty, first as a narration and later as a drama&mdash;the event was known as the [[Ritual Tale of Kibh Jeen]].<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nNerra Ziveri began the tradition of the Academy taking on some older students, beginning with some [[Tarasin]] on the cusp of adulthood and expanding to teenage [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] and [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'leks]]. He also extended the time students stayed in the group learning environment, expanded the training in alien cultures, and instituted a program of \"[[Jedi quest]]s\" for his students to gain some experience in the galaxy beyond. All these policies were non-standard for a praxeum, but the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|High Council]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], always keeping an eye on the Academy and the nearby Fortress, supported Ziveri's initiatives for his experimental school.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nThe Almas Academy grew in only a few years, in what Ziveri considered the will of the Force. Ziveri was also training Qel-Bertuk as the next Headmaster of the Academy.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nDiscovering that Klis Joo was unhappy with her assignment as Jedi watchman of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], Ziveri offered her a teaching job at his Academy. Joo eventually accepted and reached Almas around [[55 BBY/Legends|55 BBY]]. Around the same time, Ziveri accepted one Wookiee student who was old even for his Academy's standards, [[Kirlocca]]&mdash;the last student he personally accepted.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nZiveri was convinced the Sith fortress was important to the future of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and attempted to probe its dark side aura. One day in [[56 BBY/Legends|56 BBY]], he succeeded in penetrating the aura. He said his farewells to Qel-Bertuk, whom he made the new Headmaster of the Academy. Ziveri then left the planet and disappeared on a mysterious mission, never to be seen again.<ref name=\"LFC\" /> A bust of Ziveri remained at the Academy as a reminder of his legacy.\n\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Nerra Ziveri was a [[Force ghost]], active in the [[Cularin system]]. Ziveri was present when the flying fortress ''[[Conkesta]]'' built by [[Dark Jedi/Legends|dark Jedi]] [[Karae Nalvas]] was destroyed.<ref name=itsc\">''[[Into the Storm Clouds]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRole-playing game adventure ''[[Into the Storm Clouds]]'' feature an optional scene only to be played if any playable character dabbled in the dark side of the Force. That character would meet the spirit of a Twi'lek Jedi, who is suggested to be Ziveri, and is offered the choice to either die because of injuries, join the dark side or forfeit all of the character levels that character might have earned. It is unclear whether this is Ziveri's own power operating or some outer power with Ziveri only acting as a mediator.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Into the Storm Clouds]]'' {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*''[[Tilnes Rising]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020207blanius&c=swlfc|text=Discussions With Lanius|int=Discussions With Lanius|archivedate=20030813172935}}\n*''[[The Eye]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020228aacademy&c=swlfc|text=Into the Academy|int=Into the Academy|archivedate=20030803001756}}\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ziveri, Nerra}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Force ghosts]]\n[[Category:Jedi Council members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Masters]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
