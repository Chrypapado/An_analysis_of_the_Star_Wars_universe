Despite Corellia's [[Contemplanys Hermi|neutrality]] in [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|earlier clashes]], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] declared war on the planet in retaliation for a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Privateer/Legends|privateer]] [[Corellian privateer attack on Coruscant|attack on Coruscant]]. In the ensuing strife, Corellian forces swiftly defeated the [[Republic Navy]], and the [[Prince/Legends|Prince]]-[[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] personally imposed the [[Alsakan Conflicts peace treaty|terms of peace]] at [[Sword/Legends|swordpoint]] before the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], ending the war.\n\n==Biography==\nJonash e Solo was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] individual who, as [[Prince-Admiral/Legends|Prince-Admiral]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], served as a leader of the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] military during the [[Seventeenth Alsakan Conflict]], the last in a [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|series of wars]] fought between two rival factions of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Socioeconomic tensions had led to civil war between [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]], two influential Republic worlds with sizable military forces, but Corellia&mdash;also a member of the Republic&mdash;opted not to get involved in the conflicts and [[Contemplanys Hermi|declared neutrality]]. When the Seventeenth Conflict broke out in [[3017 BBY]], the Corellian military was prepared to intervene and end the civil war once and for all.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\nAs the [[Republic Navy]] faced off against the [[Fleet/Legends|fleets]] of Alsakan-dominated worlds along the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]], Corellia built up a force of advanced, long-range [[Frigate/Legends|frigates]] whose state-of-the-art technological innovations made them superior to the [[Battleship/Legends|battleships]] fielded by Coruscant and Alsakan, as demonstrated when Corellian [[Privateer/Legends|privateers]] launched attacks on [[Corellian privateer attack on Coruscant|both]] [[Corellian privateer attack on Alsakan|planets]]. In response, the Republic, under [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Vedij]], declared war on Corellia, a move that proved disastrous, as the Corellian military repeatedly bested Republic forces. The [[Prince/Legends|Prince]]-[[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] traveled to the [[Senate Building]] on Coruscant to personally establish the [[Alsakan Conflicts peace treaty|terms of peace]], negotiating them at [[Sword/Legends|swordpoint]] before the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. In doing so, he brought about a permanent end to the Alsakan Conflicts,<ref name=\"EGW\" /> making Corellia the ultimate victor.<ref name=\"Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA leader of the Corellian military, Jonash e Solo oversaw<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Corellia's victory<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> in the Seventeenth Alsakan Conflict when he dictated the terms of a peace treaty to the Republic Senate on Coruscant. His actions ensured that no future Alsakan Conflict would occur.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJonash e Solo was created for ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', a [[2012]] reference book written by [[Jason Fry]] and [[Paul R. Urquhart]], in which he was established as a major figure in the Seventeenth Alsakan Conflict.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Despite their shared surname, Jonash's relationship to later Corellian leader [[Berethron e Solo]] and other members of the [[House of Solo]], if any, has yet to be explored.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Suns of Fortune]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Jonash e Solo\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:e Solo, Jonash}}\n[[Category:Admirals and generals]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
