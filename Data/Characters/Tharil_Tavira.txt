Although married, he began an affair with a young native [[Gender/Legends|girl]] named [[Leonia Tavira|Leonia]], whom he married when his [[Tharil Tavira's first wife|wife]] [[Death/Legends|died]] suddenly and unexpectedly. Shortly afterward, he suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him.\n\nDue to a rare [[allergy]] to [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]], it was impossible to treat him. Facing a very long and painful recovery process with no guarantee of success, Tharil eventually [[Suicide/Legends|killed]] himself. He was succeeded as Governor of Eiattu by Leonia, who was suspected by some of having engineered both his first wife's death and his stroke.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIt is sometimes claimed that Grand Moff Tavira controlled not just [[Eiattu 6]] but all of [[Ado sector]]; however, there seems to be no [[canon]] evidence for this, and his [[Oversector/Legends|priority sector]] may have been limited to the one [[Planet/Legends|planet]], or perhaps simply its [[Star system/Legends|star system]].\n\nThere is also some uncertainty about Tharil Tavira's rank: he is identified as a [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] when first referred to in the story, and the badge Leonia is normally shown wearing is appropriate for this rank, but she herself is only ever called simply a [[Moff/Legends|Moff]].\n\nTavira is referred to as \"Thavil Tavira\" in ''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Warrior Princess]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tharil Tavira\n|ru=\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043b \u0422\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tavira, Tharil}}\n[[Category:Eiattuans]]\n[[Category:Grand Moffs of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
