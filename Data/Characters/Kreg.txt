He was a friend of [[Watto's flunky]], who also was present at that [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], when [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] was searching for Watto. The flunky agreed to help the Jedi on the condition he bought him a glass of [[Juri juice/Legends|juri juice]], and also asked for a juri juice for his friend Kreg, who was enjoying the performance of [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] and [[Ortolan/Legends|Ortolan]] musicians.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Ah, my friend here is a little more sociable after a drink or two.|Kreg, on Watto's flunky|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"Chronology\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Kreg was one of the many patrons of [[7-Gee Lounge]], a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] just next to the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Mos Espa Grand Arena]], located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. A short [[Time/Legends|time]] before the [[Standard year/Legends|year]]'s [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing/Legends|Podrace]] would be held at the arena, Kreg was drinking [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]] in the cantina with his [[Human/Legends|Human]] friend, [[Watto's flunky|a flunky]] of the local [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] [[Watto/Legends|Watto]].<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n[[File:WattosFlunky5.png|thumb|left|200px|The flunky and Kreg drinking in the 7-Gee Lounge]]\nThe pair was listening the performance of [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] and [[Ortolan/Legends|Ortolan]] [[Musician/Legends|musicians]] in the cantina when Kreg's friend was approached by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]]. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] was looking for Watto, with whom he had to speak, but Jinn had not find him anywhere in the arena. As the flunky worked for the junk dealer, Jinn asked him about the location of Watto. However, the flunky did not want to be bothered by businesses while partying, and told the Jedi to go away. Kreg heard the conversation, and advised Jinn to buy a [[Juri juice/Legends|juri juice]] or a [[Bantha blaster/Legends|bantha blaster]] for the flunky to loosen his tongue. Jinn followed Kreg's tip, and bought a glass of juri juice from the cantina's [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[EV-7G7]]. He gave the drink to the flunky, who immediately became more helpful to the Jedi. Jinn again asked about Watto, but the flunky first told him to buy a drink for Kreg too. Jinn did so, and gave the juri juice to Kreg, who gratefully took it. The flunky then directed Jinn to Watto, and resumed to drink with the Ithorian.<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\nBefore Jinn left the cantina, Kreg shared some information with the Jedi. Kreg told Jinn that the notorious [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], who resided in his [[Jabba's private box|private box]] inside the arena, enjoyed to watch a fight, and would surely reward Jinn if the Jedi could provide entertainment to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Kreg advised Jinn to turn to [[Anabar]], a local [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]] who dealed illegal weapons, if the Jedi Master had a need for explosive devices. The Ithorian also encouraged Jinn to talk with [[Lim]] near the entrance of the arena, and in addition, quietly revealed that \"the password is 'Wortz'\".<ref name=\"PMvg\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Is that juri juice for me?
