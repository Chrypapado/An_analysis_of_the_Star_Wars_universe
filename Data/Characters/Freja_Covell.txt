But not at the expense of an overall battle plan.|General Covell explaining to a subordinate officer during Grand Admiral Thrawn's attack on Myrkr|Dark Force Rising}}\n'''Freja Covell''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] who served as a [[General/Legends|general]] in the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]]. One of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] chief army commanders during his [[Thrawn campaign|offensive]] against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Covell led the takeover of the abandoned [[Myrkr Base|headquarters]] of [[Talon Karrde]]'s organization on [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]]. He was later killed by the insane [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Joruus C'baoth]] not long before the [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Battle of Bilbringi]] of [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\nCovell had freshly graduated from the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Academy]] when he was made a junior officer in an Army regiment commanded by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Maximilian Veers/Legends|Maximilian Veers]]. Under the colonel's tutelage, Covell learned to command ground forces and grew to love the [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] divisions as much as Veers did. They both understood the power of walkers and the fear they generated in the enemy. To sit in the cockpit of a walker satisfied Covell like nothing else could. Veers saw himself reflected in the younger officer, so that when Veers was promoted to general and given command of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] ground forces in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], he brought Covell with him, where Covell's excellent performance earned him the rank of colonel in charge of one of Veers' battlegroups.\n\n[[File:Covell_(AT-AT).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Covell in command of an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]].]]\n\nLieutenant Colonel Freja Covell managed to get the backing of the [[Assassin's Guild]] to fight three Rebel [[Alliance Special Forces/Legends|SpecForces]] units on [[Archais]]. The [[battle of Archais]] put both the [[Shroud Team|Shroud]] and [[Eclipse Team]]s on the ropes. At that same moment, Rebel officer [[Mosara Thiirn]] deserted, surrendering her ship and herself to Covell, which led to an increasingly bad situation for the Rebel forces. Unfortunately for the Empire, Thiirn did not know any information they were unaware of.<ref name=\"AIR\">''[[Alliance Intelligence Reports]]''</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]], in which Veers' assault force routed the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] troops defending [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]], High Colonel Covell served as Veers' \"first officer,\" and personally commanded one of the AT-ATs assigned to [[Blizzard Force/Legends|Blizzard Force]]. The Rebel tactics brought down his walker, wounding him in the process, but he made a good showing of himself and his command abilities. Despite his wounds, he got to safety and took charge of a stormtrooper group, which routed a larger number of Rebel troops before they could dig into defensive positions.<ref name=\"DFRSb\">''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nLater, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] promoted Covell to the rank of [[Major General/Legends|Major General]] and placed him in command of the ground forces aboard the [[Chimaera/Legends|''Chimaera'']]. Subsequently, [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] advanced Covell, now a [[General/Legends|general]] to a position of senior leadership in the Army.<ref name=\"DFRSb\" /> During Thrawn's campaign, General Covell commanded numerous ground assaults&mdash;often leading from the front&mdash;and was finally assigned to the protection of [[Wayland]]. At Wayland, [[Joruus C'baoth]] took control of his mind with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and in fact replaced parts of Covell's mind with his own. However, a group of [[ysalamir]]i created interference with the Force that severed the connection. Covell's mind was compromised severely&mdash;while he lived for a short time inside the ysalamiri's bubble, long enough to relay some \"special orders\" given to him by C'baoth, he was dead before the next morning.<ref>''[[The Last Command]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Kleyn_Selid2.jpg|thumb|Freja Covell.]]\n\nCovell was a brilliant ground tactician. Like Veers, Covell mastered the commanding of the AT-AT and [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] units in battle during the post-Endor campaigns, ensuring that they would continued to be used by Imperial ground forces for years to come. Many of Covell's innovative ground battle tactics were adopted by later Imperial Army commanders.\n\nCovell disliked [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] officers, thinking them to be afraid to leave their ships and enter real combat.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Alliance Intelligence Reports]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|6|Communiqu\u00e9s}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Freja Covell\n|pl=Freja Covell\n|ru=\u0424\u0440\u0435\u044f \u041a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\n|tr=Freja Covell\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Covell, Freja}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Death Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army generals of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thrawn's fleet personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
