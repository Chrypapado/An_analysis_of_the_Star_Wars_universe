At some point, he managed to capture and imprison some of the pirates in his basement, after which he left his home to locate an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] garrison to have them arrested. He left his wife, Helen, to guard the pirates. While he was away, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]], on a [[Quest of the Hero of Tatooine|quest]] to become the [[Hero of Tatooine]], visited his home. Helen asked her guest if they would watch the prisoners while she took a break, to which the spacer agreed. During this time, the pirates tried to persuade the spacer to free them, but they refused and proceeded to tell Helen of their plans to escape. At that same moment, Roric had finally arrived back with two Imperial [[Exogen-class dark trooper|dark troopers]] following. The troopers promptly arrested the pirates and Roric thanked the anonymous spacer for protecting both his home and his wife.<ref name=\"SWG:TMotH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Roric.jpg|thumb|right|155px|One possible appearance for Roric]]\nRoric is a non-playable character who appears in the [[2003]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']]. He appears if the player is on the \"Mark of Honor\" portion of the \"Hero of Tatooine\" questline. Due to the nature of the game, Roric's appearance changes every time he is encountered, so the provided picture is only one possible depiction of him. He is consistently a Human male, however.<ref name=\"SWG:TMotH\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Hero of Tatooine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Goldenfield,Roric}}\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
