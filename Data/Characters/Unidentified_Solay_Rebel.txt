I'm a dead man. Let me live my last hours my way. And who are you to talk anyway? Look how you're spending your time!|attr=Luke Skywalker and the Solay rebel|src=Star Wars (1977) 89}}\nThis rebel was loyal to the revolutionary movement led by [[Raggold]] and fought in the [[Solay Civil War]]. However, his loyalty was dependent on payment, and the rebel lived comfortably on the funds that were given to him by the rebel movement. Following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the Solay revolutionaries were secretly funded by an [[Governor/Legends|Imperial Governor]] in order to overthrow the [[Solay Royal Court]]. The rich rebel overheard rumors of the secret funding, but he was unaware that Raggold was the one who had organized the secret Imperial alliance.\n\nAfter the Solay rebels overthrew the government and captured [[King/Legends|King]] [[Blackart]], the Imperial Governor's forces moved in and took control of the planet. The rebel, knowing that his days were numbered, escaped to a [[brothel]], deciding to spend his last days living for himself. It was there that he was encountered by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who was attempting to discover who had sold out the rebel movement to the Imperials. Skywalker was led to the rebel by [[Scamp]], a local thief who was hoping to steal from the rich rebel.\n\n[[File:SolayRebel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Solay Rebel is attacked by Luke Skywalker.]]\n\nSkywalker violently interrogated the rebel, using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to slam the man against a wall and [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|Force choke]] him. Panicked, the rebel recounted the rumors he had heard about the Imperials funding the revolution and that the traitor had been a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] in the court. Skywalker recognized that the man only knew rumors, and frustrated, he contemplated killing the man. However, he eventually decided against it, releasing the man and scolding him for living such a self-centered life. The rebel responded that he was simply a dead man and that he would live the last hours of his life the way he wanted. As Skywalker and Scamp left the premises, the rebel called out that the Jedi was a hypocrite, as he was spending his time [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] innocent people. A short time later, the Imperials took full control of the planet, and the rebel was likely killed by the Imperial Governor's forces.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Solay rebel is shown with two different eye colors. He is initially shown with blue eyes, but in the next close-up, his eyes change to green.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 89|''Star Wars'' 89]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Solay residents]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified mercenaries]]"}}}]}}}}
