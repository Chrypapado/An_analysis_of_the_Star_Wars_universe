Both Tryst and his wife were strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], though they were never trained, as the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] had been virtually wiped out by then.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]], Tryst and Cassa befriended an injured [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] named [[Sliven]]. They became friends quickly despite the hostility between the settlers and the Tusken Raiders. Tryst would learn from Sliven how to wield a [[gaderffii]]. One day, he was enjoying a gaderffi sparring session outside his home with Sliven. Sliven's tribe caught sight of this however, and assumed that Sliven was under attack. Mistaking them for enemies, he and Cassa were killed by the tribe before Sliven could stop them.\n\nOut of pity and in return for the kindness shown to him by them, Sliven adopted a then-three-year-old Tahiri and raised her as a Tusken Raider until she turned nine in [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], when she was discovered to be Force-sensitive by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Tionne Solusar]] during a trip to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. She would only learn about it during a return trip to Tatooine from the [[Jedi Praxeum]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]'' {{Vision|[[Tahiri Veila]]}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tryst Veila\n}}\n\n[[Category:Farmers|Veila, Tryst]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives|Veila, Tryst]]\n[[Category:Humans|Veila, Tryst]]\n[[Category:Males|Veila, Tryst]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Veila, Tryst]]"}}}]}}}}
