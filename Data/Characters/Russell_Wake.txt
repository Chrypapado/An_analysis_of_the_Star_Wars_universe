However, when the Republic was reformed into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], factories and industries were now closed off under the rule of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and the Imperial Authority. Russell was enraged of this, but he continued his employment as a caretaker for his former factory and held hope that everything would change in time.<ref name=\"LOTJSW\" />\n\n[[18 BBY/Legends|A year later]], the Bellassan factories were re-opened by the Empire in order to produce parts for the defense industry of the [[Death Star/Legends|constructed Death Star]]. Russell worked as a janitor at the time since his former job was transferred by the Empire. Before the opening of the company, Russell met [[Ferus Olin]], a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who eluded [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] during the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].When Russell realized that Olin had become friendly with, he scorned him, but Ferus told him that he was working as a double agent. Russell was impressed by the courage and offered his friendship to him.<ref name=\"LOTJSW\" />\n\nAfter agreeing to help the Jedi, Russell assisted his new friend to sneak into a meeting between [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] who were speaking to a team of scientists that worked for them. Russell was able to shut down the security system in the factory for fifteen minutes and gave time for Ferus, along with [[Roan Lands]], [[Amie Antin]], and [[Trever Flume]] to search the Empire's computers for vital data. However, when Darth Vader entered the room, Russell remained calm after he confronted the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] face-to-face. Seeing that Russell was involved in this conspiracy, Vader began to [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force choke]] Russell and force him to reveal any information on Ferus. Despite the pain, Russell refused answer his question to him and died in honor to protect his friend and family that he cared for.<ref name=\"LOTJSW\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Secret Weapon]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Russell Wake\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wake, Russell}}\n[[Category:Bellassans]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
