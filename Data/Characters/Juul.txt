My brother Jiik and I were watching Skavak for you. Big mistake. Nothing but trouble|Juul, speaking to the Voidhound|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Juul''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] resident of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and the sister of [[Jiik]]. In [[3643 BBY]] the [[Justicars' Brigade]] arrested her brother and Juul had to ask help from the [[Voidhound]] to get him out.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Jiik and I were tailing Skavak when the Justicars came after us. Jiik stuck to Skavak. I drew the Justicars.|Juul tells the Voidhound about tracking Skavak|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nIn the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"Time\">{{TOR_dates|1}}</ref> Juul lived with [[Gender/Legends|her]] brother [[Jiik]] on the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. The siblings worked as informants for the [[Darmas Pollaran's informant network|network]] of [[Darmas Pollaran]]. While tailing notorious criminal [[Skavak/Legends|Skavak]] for Polloran, the two entered [[Justicar territory|the territory]] of the [[Justicars' Brigade]] and were forced to separate to keep from being captured. Jiik continued following Skavak and saw him head into [[Sector 943|the Works]], but was [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] by the Justicars. after she witnessed them meet with their backers in the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]].\n<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\nJuul rendezvoused with [[Corso Riggs]] and [[Voidhound|a]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]] who had enlisted Pollaran to help them track down Skavak. She angrily confronted the smuggler, blaming them for her brother's capture, and told them they would have to free Jiik from the [[Justicars' Tower]] to find out where Skavak went. Juul warned the two  they would have to disable the security cameras, which she referred to as \"[[Droid/Legends|droid]]-[[Eye/Legends|eyes]]\", so that the Justicars would not be able to identify them or her brother, and demanded they take a [[Holocomm/Legends|holocommunicator]] with them so she would be able to speak with Jiik once he was freed.<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\nThe outlaws were able to free Jiik, and the two siblings spoke over Juul's holocommunicator. Jiik told them of the Justicar's dealings with the Sith and Skavak's destination. Juul suggested that in order for him to hide from the Justicars, he crawl through a tunnel they had found earlier to a warehouse, where she could hide him from the Justicars, and had him take the holocommunicator from the captain so she would be able to watch him as he crawled through the tunnel.<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're from where the air is thin and heads are soft. This is turfer land. Wise up and grab some ground!|Juul, to the Voidhound.|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nLiving in the harsher areas of Coruscant, which she referred to as 'turfer land', caused Jiik to develop a severe demeanor. When her brother was captured by the Justicars, she blamed the future Voidhound and Corso Riggs, as they were responsible for the siblings tracking Skavak, but also expressed serious concern over her brother. She made sure the Voidhound brought a holocommunicator with them so she would be able to talk to Jiik the moment he was free, and had him take it with him when he crawled through the tunnels, out of concern for her injured brother.<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\nJiik was aware that Corso and the smuggler would need to disable the Justicars' security cameras, so they could not be identified, but displayed an ignorance of technology by referring to them as \"droid-eyes\". She also expressed dislike and contempt towards the two outlaws, calling them \"cloudheads\" and indicated that she believed they were not used to the harsher regions of Coruscant.<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\nJiik had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], blue eyes, and tan skin. Together with her brother, she was a skilled tracker and was able to lead the Justicars' away from Jiik without letting them catch her.<ref name=\"Due Process\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
