He was a mysterious individual, showing up only when it suited him (usually for high profit deals or for amusement value), and always in disguise. His most common appearances were as a young man, an older man, or an aged crone, but he once disguised himself as a [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]]. The way he was typically identified was that he would wear a cutting of a [[ny'yosin bush]]. Endac was very serious while conducting business, and had no patience for those who cracked jokes.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Endac, Quaad}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
