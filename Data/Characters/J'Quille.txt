During the [[Galactic Civil War]], he worked as a [[bounty hunter]] for the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] on the planet [[Tatooine]]. Unbeknownst to Jabba, the Whiphid truly served as a [[spy]] for the Hutt's rival [[Lord|Lady]] [[Valarian]], with whom J'Quille had a romantic affair, and planned to [[Death|kill]] Jabba for her by [[poison]]ing the Hutt's [[Foodstuff|food]]. J'Quille was present in [[Jabba's Palace]] in the [[Standard year|year]] [[4 ABY]], when a group of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebels]] attempted to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] from Jabba's clutches. The Whiphid witnessed the arrival and capture of each member of the group.\n\nAfter the final rebel, the [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]], was captured, J'Quille traveled on the Hutt's [[sail barge]], the ''[[Khetanna]]'', to witness the rebels' planned executions at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon|Pit of Carkoon]]. However, the rebels managed to defeat Jabba's forces there and kill the Hutt, destroying his sail barge as they escaped. J'Quille survived the explosion but found that Valarian had placed a [[bounty]] on him, since he had not been personally responsible for Jabba's death. Unable to leave Tatooine, J'Quille joined the [[B'omarr Order]].\n\n==Biography==\n===A spy in the palace===\nThe [[Whiphid]] J'Quille was [[Reproduction|born]] on the frozen [[Planet|world]] of [[Toola]], but [[Gender|he]] dwelt on the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. On Tatooine, he served the [[crime lord]] [[Lord|Lady]] [[Valarian]], a fellow Whiphid with whom he had a romantic affair.<ref name=\"CEUE\" />\n\nActing as a [[spy]] for Valarian, J'Quille took up work as a [[bounty hunter]] for the [[Hutt]] crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], Valarian's biggest rival on Tatooine.

Their arrival was part of a [[Rescue of Han Solo|plan to free Solo]] that also involved Skywalker's two droids as well as [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], a friend of Solo's who was working undercover as one of Jabba's guards. Standing directly in front of J'Quille, Organa claimed she had come to collect the bounty on Chewbacca's head but demanded that Jabba pay more than originally promised. After Organa threatened the room with a [[Class-A thermal detonator|thermal detonator]], the crime lord agreed to pay the higher bounty, and the Wookiee was taken away.<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\n[[File:Stairway_at_Jabbas_palace.png|thumb|left|220px|J'Quille witnessed the capture of Leia Organa in Jabba's Palace.]]\nOrgana remained in the palace, believing that her disguise had worked; however, the Hutt had seen through the costume and, after pretending to leave the throne room later that [[Standard day|night]], remained in hiding along with much of his court. Believing the throne room to be clear, Organa sneaked in and freed Solo from his carbon-freeze, after which Jabba and his court revealed their presence. J'Quille stood upon a set of stairs into the throne room and watched as both Solo and Organa were captured.<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\nWhen Skywalker himself arrived at Jabba's Palace shortly thereafter to enact the final part of the rebel plan, J'Quille was once again in a booth in the throne room, [[sleep]]ing along with a number of other members of the court. The Whiphid awoke to see Skywalker attempt to negotiate with Jabba before threatening him with a [[DL-18 blaster pistol|blaster pistol]]. In response, the Hutt dropped the [[Jedi]]<ref name=\"ROTJ\" /> and the [[Gamorrean]] guard [[Jubnuk]]<ref name=\"SWCL\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> into the rancor pit. The court cheered for<ref name=\"ROTJ\" /> Pateesa<ref name=\"LD\" /> as they watched the fight in the pit play out, but Skywalker slew the beast, causing Jabba to order the execution of Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon|Pit of Carkoon]].<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\n===Skirmish at the Pit of Carkoon===\n[[File:Khetanna_boom.png|thumb|right|220px|J'Quille traveled to the Pit of Carkoon on Jabba's sail barge, which was later destroyed.]]\nJ'Quille and many other court members accompanied Jabba on his [[sail barge]],<ref name=\"CEUE\" /> the ''[[Khetanna]]'',<ref name=\"USW\" /> to view the planned executions at the pit, where the rebels would be thrown into the jaws of a [[sarlacc]]. However, once at the pit, the rebel prisoners freed themselves and defeated Jabba's guards, while Organa, who had been chained to Jabba as a [[Slavery|slave]], strangled the Hutt. Skywalker then boarded the sail barge and rescued Organa, who pointed a [[Laser cannon|turret]] on the barge's top deck to shoot at the vehicle itself, causing it to explode as the rebels escaped.<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\nJ'Quille managed to survive the sail barge's explosion but later discovered that Valarian, his former lover, had placed a large bounty on his head, as he had not been the one to kill Jabba. Finding himself unable to leave Tatooine due to the bounty, the Whiphid chose to join the [[B'omarr Order]], a group of monks who lived within Jabba's Palace.<ref name=\"CEUE\" /> J'Quille was mentioned in an [[Unidentified artist|artist's]] [[Unidentified artist's journal|journal]], which was restored, expanded, and displayed at the [[Graf Archive]]<ref name=\"Alien Archives\">''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]''</ref> at some point after [[34 ABY]].<ref name=\"Year\">''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]'' establishes that the restored [[in-universe]] [[Unidentified artist's journal|journal]] discusses [[Poe Dameron]]'s [[Battle of Oetchi|mutiny]] against [[Amilyn Holdo]], which is depicted in [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']].

The entire outfit was fairly heavy to wear and extremely warm inside, meaning that Dry had to remove the head in between takes so that he could be cooled down with hair dryers to prevent overheating.
