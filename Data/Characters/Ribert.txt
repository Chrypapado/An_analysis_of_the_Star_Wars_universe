While with [[Gender|his]] [[Ribert's shipmate|shipmate]] on [[Rajtiri]] sometime after the end of the [[Clone Wars]], he was present at the [[Wanton Wellspring]] [[cantina]] in the city of [[Jibuto]]. The two sat at a table with the [[Nautolan]] [[Ranos Yalli]] and the [[Dressellian]] [[Has Obitt]]. Ribert stated that the Clone Wars had started to feel like a golden age for [[business]], because there was always work, even if it involved a lot of travel. Yalli remarked in reply that it was one mess to another, and Ribert added that no one seems to care about bargains. His shipmate disagreed, saying that the work was still there, but more competitive to get.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\nYalli suggested that they divert supplies of [[meiloorun fruit]], and reap from the profits when the growers pay them a tax to keep their shipments intact. Ribert scowled at the notion, noting that it sounds like a lot of effort. Obitt complained that he's sick of the song the cantina's [[Twi'lek]] [[band]] is playing. Yalli suggested he start a band, but the smuggler declined, because it wouldn't pay well in [[credit]]s. Ribert countered, saying he obviously doesn't know bands. The group watched as a fight broke out in the cantina, with the participants dragged away by [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[stormtrooper]]s. Obitt questioned when fights became a reason to arrest people, and Ribert replied that the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor]] had given the [[Clone trooper|clones]] new orders.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\n===Smuggling run===\nObitt left the group to meet with [[Matese]], a contact of his. Matese suggested that he start arms smuggling, as it's a lucrative business. Obitt was skeptical, but Matese looked over at Ribert and the others back at the table, reminding him that his friends could use the work.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\nSome time later, Obitt agreed to smuggle [[proton torpedo]]es and munitions for Matese. Ribert was with Obitt' crew, and they stayed aboard their ship as Imperial stormtroopers boarded for an inspection. He and his shipmate helped disconnect the canister modules from the ship, and in return receive a large sum of credits.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nRibert had broad shoulders, a bald head, and a darker skin complexion than his shipmate.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRibert first appeared in the [[2016]] [[canon]] novel ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which was written by [[James Luceno]]. The novel served as a prequel to the [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film, ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'' {{1st|[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel (audiobook)|''Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel (audiobook)|''Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Ribert\n|ja=\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
