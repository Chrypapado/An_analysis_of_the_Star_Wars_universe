In pursuit of Nunb, the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] traveled to Tralus, where they found themselves in a [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] [[Leyli's city|city]]. Shortly after, at a [[Gold/Legends|golden]] building in the [[City/Legends|city]], Leyli met with Rogues [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Leyli informed them that her [[Queen/Legends|queen]] would be unwilling to help them for fear of Imperial reprisals, and expressed her fear of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]].
