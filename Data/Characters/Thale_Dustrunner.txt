Do you really think I have time to talk to you? Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I'm just busy.|Thale Dustrunner, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Thale Dustrunner''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] officer of the [[Corellian Security Force]] who lived on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|We've got the snitches badge. I want you to take it to Corellia and meet with his superiors. They likely don't know him on sight. Find out what's going on.|[[Borvo's guard]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Thale Dustrunner was the CorSec [[Captain/Legends|captain]] assigned to [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]]. He was involved in a CorSec investigation against the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Borvo]].<ref name=\"SWG:BGATTC\" /> During the investigation, Captain Dustrunner arrested the criminal known as [[Aldalad]] for buying illegal weapons to Borvo, and convinced him to testify against the Hutt.<ref name=\"SWG:BC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Bluffing CorSec|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the CorSec investigation against Borvo the Hutt came to an end when a spacer working for Borvo murdered the infiltrated CorSec agent [[Niksel Frangee]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. During the six years in infiltration, all of Frangee's direct superiors had retired and been replaced. Thus, nobody in the CorSec knew how Frangee looked like at the moment of his death, the spacer used Frangee's CorSec badge to pass himself off as Frangee on Corellia. The spacer met Dustrunner in the [[Coronet Capitol]] and the CorSec officer completely fell for the ruse and took the spacer for the long lost agent.<ref name=\"SWG:BGATTC\" /> Captain Dustrunner ordered the \"agent\" to protect Aldalad, the witness who wanted to testify against Borvo, and [[Maerzen]], who had discovered evidence against Borvo the Hutt. The spacer killed both of them in the [[Riverlands]], without Dustrunner suspected anything. Thale Dustrunner then asked Borvo's spy to deliver the evidence against Borvo retrieved from Maerzen to evidence storage. The spacer just left Corellia with the evidence, including Borvo's confiscated money, and brought it back to [[Borvo's guard]] on Naboo. Because of Dustrunner's ineptitude, the CorSec lost both its witness and its evidence against Borvo, making impossible to continue any investigation.<ref name=\"SWG:BC\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThale Dustrunner was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:BGATTC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Thale Dustrunner was part of the Borvo the Hutt questline on Naboo and Corellia in the original game: ''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided''.<ref name=\"SWG:AED\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref> The quests involving Thale Dustrunner were extensively revamped with the [[Star Wars Galaxies: Starter Kit|New Game Enhancements]] update in [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:BGATTC\" /><ref name=\"SWG:BC\" /><ref name=\"NGE\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20081009071222}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Thale Dustrunner}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dustrunner, Thale}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
