If beings are capable of protecting others but refuse to take action to preserve their own sense of peace, they are being selfish. They place themselves and their sense of peace over the peace of others, and so they defend a philosophy instead of lives. In this way, they fail everyone.|Jedi Knight Ylenic It'kla to fellow Knight [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]]|Elusion Illusion}}\n'''Ylenic It'kla''' was a [[Caamasi]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Old Jedi Order]]. Born to the [[Kla (clan)|Kla]] clan of [[Caamas/Legends|Caamas]], he became one of the few Caamasi to join the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], where he served as a negotiator and mediator. It'kla also befriended [[Human/Legends|Human]] Jedi [[Nejaa Halcyon]]. When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out, It'kla was not able to fight at the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|Battle of Geonosis]], but only seven days later, he went on a [[Mission to Corellia (Clone Wars)|mission to Corellia]] with fellow Jedi [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] in a complicated plot that he worked on with Halcyon to help the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Ratri Tane]] defect to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]].\n\nLater in the war, It'kla joined Halcyon and another Jedi he knew as \"[[Desertwind]]\" on a mission to investigate the return of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Pursuing a number of archaeological thefts to [[Susevfi]], they encountered the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Nikkos Tyris]] and his followers. Tyris was defeated, at the cost of Halcyon's life, and It'kla returned the late Jedi's effects to Halcyon's family, whom he helped to take care of afterward. It'kla survived the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and the [[Caamas Firestorm|Destruction of Caamas]], relocating to [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] to become the [[Trustant]] of that world's [[Caamasi Remnant]] and a personal aide to [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]]. It'kla helped in the formation of a resistance to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], serving as a representative of the [[Alderaanian Resistance]] at [[Bria Tharen]]'s meeting on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] and aiding fellow Purge survivor [[Rahm Kota]] in his own search for Organa. He died when the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed Alderaan]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Knight of the Republic===\nYlenic It'kla was born to the [[Kla (clan)|Kla]] clan of [[Caamas/Legends|Caamas]], along with at least one sibling, a [[Elegos A'Kla's mother|sister]]. When he became a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], one of a rare few Caamasi to do so, It'kla brought great pride to his clan. He left Caamas,<ref name=\"IJ\" /> and by [[28 BBY/Legends|28 BBY]], had become a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"knighting\">''[[Elusion Illusion]]'' establishes that at the time of the story, It'kla had been a Jedi Knight longer than [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]], who was knighted in 28 BBY according to [[Star Wars (1998) 45|''Star Wars'' (1998) 45]].</ref> For almost their entire shared lives, It'kla was friends with the [[Corellian Jedi]] [[Nejaa Halcyon]],<ref name=\"POTJ\">''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''</ref> and the Caamasi visited Corellia at least once, serving in the position of mediator. A pacifist, It'kla spent much of his Jedi career mediating and counseling, as well as using his [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] skills in service to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"EL\" /> It'kla rarely used his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], preferring to solve situations with negotiation or diplomacy.<ref name=\"POTJ\" />\n\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out with the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|Battle of Geonosis]]. It'kla did not fight at [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], though he would say later that he would gladly have done so. Within days, a [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] named [[Ratri Tane]] fled to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], seeking asylum for himself and his family and carrying stolen prototype technology&mdash;sabotaged in case the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] ever retrieved it&mdash;as insurance to protect his family. When Nejaa Halcyon learned of this, he contacted It'kla to serve as a liaison with the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] for a plan he was working on. Halcyon, It'kla, and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] decided to move Tane and his family off Corellia. Meanwhile, Halcyon would pose as Tane, and Jedi would be sent to Corellia to distract any Separatist agents and force them to move against \"Tane\", giving the Jedi of Corellia&mdash;if not Corellia itself&mdash;cause to side with the Republic.<ref name=\"EL\" />\n\nWindu chose the Jedi Knight [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] to join It'kla on the [[Mission to Corellia (Clone Wars)|mission]], and seven days after Geonosis, he called It'kla and Secura to the [[Jedi Temple]] to brief them. Secura was not let into the entire plan, and told instead that they were being sent to retrieve the real Tane. Leaving Coruscant from a commercial spaceport to attract as little attention as possible, It'kla and Secura flew the smuggling vessel [[Flare (yacht)|''Flare'']], carrying supplies for Corellians and Republic expatriates. Landing in the city of [[Coronet/Legends|Coronet]], the two Jedi, in their guise as traders, sold off their goods, while It'kla put out the word that they were looking for passengers. Two buyers pointed the Jedi to the [[Homestar]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. At the cantina, Secura spotted Halcyon&mdash;believing him to be Tane&mdash;and a pair of [[Gotal/Legends|Gotals]], who had the ability to detect [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-usage. The two Jedi moved towards Tane, as did the Gotals; however, a [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] named [[Lorfo]], one of those in on It'kla's plan, caused a distraction around Secura to draw the Gotals' attention. One Gotal opened fire on Secura while the other moved after Halcyon; a number of other cohorts revealed themselves when Secura drew her lightsaber, and a firefight began between them and the two Jedi. It was soon interrupted by agents of the [[Corellian Security Force]], who briefly interrogated It'kla and Secura before allowing them to leave, but Halcyon was gone by then.<ref name=\"EL\" />\n\n[[File:ElusionIllusion.jpg|thumb|left|It'kla and [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] in the [[Homestar]].]]\nThe Jedi had carried a [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracking device]], meant to lead It'kla to the hideout of the criminals who had taken him, but it failed to work. When It'kla found himself unable to locate Halcyon, Lorfo approached the two and offered to lead them to Tane. At the warehouse where the criminal boss, [[Tendir Blue]], was hiding, Lorfo alerted Blue to their presence, and the Jedi were taken hostage. Halcyon was brought out in front of them, Blue's blaster trained on him, and Blue explained that they had taken the sabotaged prototype technology Halcyon had been carrying. Blue revealed that he also had been provided [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] by the Separatists, as they too trained their guns on the Jedi, and It'kla and Secura were disarmed. Meanwhile, Halcyon projected an image of his plan for escape into Secura's head; when the Gotals sensed the Force was being used, Blue shot Halcyon, who turned the energy into an act of [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] and sent his own [[Nejaa Halcyon's lightsaber|lightsaber]] flying into Secura's hand. As she dealt with the droids, Halcyon disabled the Gotals with the Force, and It'kla stood guard over the downed criminals. At last he revealed Halcyon's true identity and the extent of the plan to Secura. She had a suggestion to improve it, though: their original idea was to implant a memory in Blue's head that would convince him the prototype was real, which Secura believed would be unraveled by the Separatist leader [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]. Instead, she chased him off the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], pretending that he had killed It'kla and she was seeking vengeance. It was successful, and Blue went back to Dooku unknowingly carrying the sabotaged technology.<ref name=\"EL\" />\n\n===Return of the Sith===\nWith the start of the Clone Wars, It'kla took up guarding the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]],<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> and he met the Alderaanian [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]].<ref name=\"IJ\" /> Meanwhile, with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] having returned only about a decade prior, the Jedi Council asked Nejaa Halcyon to research the rumors about them. It'kla, insisting that his talents for discussion would prove useful, joined his friend;<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> another Jedi, a [[General/Legends|general]] whom It'kla knew as \"[[Desertwind]]\", led them.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> After over a month of searching, they found a looted archaeological dig that led them to the world of [[Suarbi (star)|Suarbi]]. The locals on Suarbi proved unhelpful, slowing the search and showing an allegiance to what seemed to be Sith cultists living among them. The three Jedi eventually located an area of the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Susevfi]] where a void in the Force seemed to exist, and they could not use their powers. There, in an ancient arena underneath a [[Duracrete/Legends|duracrete]] dome,<ref name=\"IJ\" /> they found three of their \"Sith\"&mdash;actually [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] who had been thought lost in the [[Battle of Baltizaar|conflict]] on [[Baltizaar/Legends|Baltizaar]].<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> The Jedi attempted to persuade the other three from their path, but the Dark Jedi leader, the [[Anzat (species)|Anzati]] [[Nikkos Tyris]], attacked. Each of the Jedi moved to take on a Dark Jedi in combat; It'kla's [[Dustrose|opponent]] was able to injure him in the flank with her lightsaber, but It'kla got beneath her guard and bisected her. He was only then able to see how the other battles were progressing. Tyris, who had been fighting Halcyon, had disarmed his opponent and was preparing to kill him. It'kla tried to send the Jedi's lightsaber back to him, but as Halcyon dove for his blade, Tyris impaled him. Mortally wounded, Halcyon was able to absorb enough of the lightsaber's energy to [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|crush]] Tyris with the Force. The [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] energy that exploded from Tyris' body brought down the dome, and Desertwind was able to hold it up long enough for It'kla to pull Halcyon to safety. Shortly thereafter, Halcyon died and vanished into the Force. It'kla and Desertwind made their way via Susevfi's capital, [[Yumfla]], back to Corellia.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nThere, It'kla delivered Halcyon's personal effects to [[Horn family|his family]], asking them not to inquire about the details of the mission. At the [[Galactic Museum]]'s request, he donated Halcyon's lightsaber to them.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> Sad at the loss of his friend, It'kla increased his commitment to the Order and helped take care of Halcyon's family. When [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] declared himself [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] and turned on the Jedi, It'kla was able to develop the skills in the Force he needed to avoid the architects of Palpatine's [[Great Jedi Purge]].<ref name=\"POTJ\" />\n\n===Alderaanian advisor===\nIt'kla was on Alderaan, visiting a friend, when his homeworld of Caamas was immolated in a surprise attack by an unknown enemy. The Jedi convinced his friend to provide a home on Alderaan for displaced Caamasi; along with the other leaders of the ravaged world, he also decided that the [[Caamasi Remnant]] needed to spread out to a number of new settlements.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> Bail Organa found It'kla a job as one of his personal advisors, placing him as [[Trustant]] of the Alderaanian Caamasi Remnant.<ref name=\"TFUCG\">''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], [[Bria Tharen]], a member of the [[Corellian Resistance/Legends|Corellian Resistance]] against the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], summoned a number of resistance groups from across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] to discuss combining their efforts. It'kla, along with the [[Human/Legends|Humans]] [[Winter Celchu|Winter]] and [[Hric Dalhney]], represented Alderaan. It'kla did not speak much, and while little was accomplished at the meeting&mdash;Dalhney vociferously opposed violent action&mdash;Winter promised to speak with Organa further about it.<ref name=\"RD\" /> Organa eventually set out to find other Jedi, and when he traveled to [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] in search of Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]], he left word with It'kla. Organa vanished upon landing, and when [[Rahm Kota]], a fellow escapee of the Purge, contacted It'kla in search of him, the Caamasi told him as much, and Kota was able to help rescue Organa. Though the viceroy was integral in the creation of a new [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]],<ref name=\"TFUn\">[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''The Force Unleashed'']]</ref> which It'kla became a part of, it drew the eye of the Empire to Alderaan. It'kla was on the world when the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]] arrived in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. Sensing his impending fate, he could do nothing but give in to the will of the Force as Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|annihilated]], killing him.<ref name=\"FF24\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|There are attempts, and there are accomplishments. Histories only praise one.|Ylenic It'kla|I, Jedi}}\n[[File:YlenicItkla-JATM.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jedi Knight Ylenic It'kla]]\nBefore his death, It'kla transferred a [[memnis]]&mdash;a kind of memory that Caamasi could share with each other&mdash;of the Susevfi battle to his nephew [[Elegos A'Kla]]. [[11 ABY/Legends|Eleven years]] after It'kla's death, A'Kla provided it to the [[Jensaarai/Legends|Jensaarai]], a group of Force-users formed out of Tyris' teachings. Though they had been laboring under a misapprehension about the Jedi and their motives for decades, after seeing the events from It'kla's point of view, the Force sect was able to be coaxed into once again opening dialogue with the Jedi Order. Shortly before this, the Jedi Knight [[Corran Horn]] had received his own vision of It'kla and the Susevfi duel from the perspective of his grandfather, Nejaa Halcyon. A'Kla later made the journey to [[The Graveyard|the remains]] of Alderaan to leave a gift in It'kla's memory, and Horn asked him to leave one of his own in Nejaa Halcyon's name.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nYlenic It'kla was a pacifist,<ref name=\"EL\" /> striving for harmony and peace like many of his species,<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> and among the Jedi, he was often called upon to counsel and mediate. However, It'kla believed that refusing to take action when the peace of others was threatened was the point at which pacifism turned to evil, and he would take action if necessary. Though he did not fight in the Battle of Geonosis, and he was grateful he did not carry the memories of it, it was something he later said he would have done gladly.<ref name=\"EL\" /> It'kla placed great stock in nobility of character;<ref name=\"IJ\" /> he took responsibility for those he took under his care, from the family of Nejaa Halcyon after the other Jedi's death to the planet of Alderaan when war struck.<ref name=\"POTJ\" />\n\nIt'kla had an inquisitive nature,<ref name=\"IJ\" /> and behind a quiet front, he was possessed of power and confidence.<ref name=\"RD\" /> The Caamasi believed doubts were important to have, as they kept one from arrogance and hence the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]].<ref name=\"EL\" /> He counseled against fear, emphasizing that the Jedi could offer freedom from that fear that brought people to the dark side.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPossessed of strength, speed, and power, and a long reach that gave him an advantage in lightsaber dueling, It'kla had the capabilities to be a formidable warrior.<ref name=\"EL\" /> It'kla possessed a [[Color/Legends|green]] lightsaber;<ref name=\"EL\" /> though he rarely used it,<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> he was an able fighter.<ref name=\"EL\" /> He was also, however, versed in the art of peaceful discussion, and he used negotiation where possible.<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> The Caamasi was a skilled pilot, a talent the Jedi Order used.<ref name=\"EL\" />\n\nIt'kla had a strong sense of smell. He remembered the identities of others chiefly by scent, rather than name.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> The Caamasi could project the equivalents of smells through the Force into the minds of other beings; strong odors could be used in this way to immobilize them.<ref name=\"EL\" /> Typical of his species, It'kla could produce memnii, a kind of stored memory that could be shared with other Caamasi and Jedi.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> When the Jedi Purge began, the Caamasi developed new Force techniques to escape Emperor Palpatine's agents.<ref name=\"POTJ\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYlenic It'kla was created in [[Michael A. Stackpole]]'s ''[[I, Jedi]]'', where the character only appears in the form of visions to [[Corran Horn]]. He would make his only live appearance in the short story ''[[Elusion Illusion]]'', also by Stackpole, where he was illustrated by [[Jan Duursema]]. It'kla's fur, described as golden with purple stripes in both ''Jedi'' and ''Illusion'', appears gray with black stripes in the story's illustrations.\n\nA timeline discrepancy occurs in ''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]'', where it is implied that the fight with Nikkos Tyris occurs before the Clone Wars; however, this is not only contradicted by ''I, Jedi'', but all stories during the Clone Wars where Nejaa Halcyon appears, including ''Elusion Illusion''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|66|Elusion Illusion}}\n*''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''The Force Unleashed'' novel]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|24|DEA4, ''The Destruction of Alderaan''}}\n*{{FFCite|28|DAG5, ''Dagobah - The Cave of Evil''}}\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{PolyhedronCite|157|I, Jensaarai}}\n*{{FFCite|104|SUR2, ''The Survival of Boba Fett}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{DB|character|aaylasecura|Secura, Aayla|archivedate=20110903085426}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ylenic It'kla\n|es=Ylenic It'kla\n|ja=\u30a4\u30ec\u30cb\u30af\u30fb\u30a4\u30c8\u30af\u30e9\n|pl=Ylenic It'kla\n|pt=Ylenic It'kla\n|ru=\u0418\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0418\u0442'\u043a\u043b\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:It'kla, Ylenic}}\n[[Category:Alderaanian Resistance members]]\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Caamasi]]\n[[Category:Jedi affiliated with the Alliance to Restore the Republic]]\n[[Category:Jedi Consulars]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
