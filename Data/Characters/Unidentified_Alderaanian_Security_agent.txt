In about [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]], the agent traveled to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], to [[Spy/Legends|spy]] on Imperial interests in the [[Deep Core Security Zone/Legends|Deep Core Security Zone]], by [[Scout/Legends|scouting]] out dozens of worlds that the Empire had recently discovered in the region. When the agent had completed his assignment, he had himself frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] to prevent himself from being discovered during his return journey to Alderaan. The carbonite slab containing the agent was shipped to [[Sel Zonn Station]], an [[XQ2 Platform]] that [[Orbit/Legends|orbited]] planet [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]], where it was received by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] [[Switch]], who put the slab into storage in the [[Space station/Legends|space station's]] [[Blue Deck]]. The Alderaanian Security operative [[Maya]] was dispatched to collect the frozen agent, but shortly after she had arrived on Sel Zonn Station she was attacked by a group of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] met with Switch in her place, to negotiate for the agent's release. Afterward, the spacers collected the carbonite slab from Blue Deck and the agent was transported back to Alderaan aboard the [[Baudo-class star yacht|''Baudo''-class star yacht]] [[Banshee (Baudo-class)|''Banshee'']]. On arrival on the planet, the agent was released from the carbonite slab.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Traitor's Gambit|int=The Traitor's Gambit|archivedate=20100118064618}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
