She spoke passionately about the importance of the [[Tarasin]] retaining their own culture. Wealthy gambler [[Kris Wahl]], who shared her passion to the dismay of his parents, provided money for her causes.<ref name=\"TRW\">''[[The Resistance Within]]''</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGerta was concerned about the actions of the [[Metatheran Cartel]] under [[Velin Wir]], and organized the [[Cularin resistance]] to gather proof of their illegal activities. She saw the Cartel cutting down [[ch'hala tree]]s with her own eyes and even got hold of a holorecording of their crime - but she knew that, should she try to make it public, the Cartel would say it was a doctored image. She considered the Cartel to be as bad as the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], although she had never seen the Federation in action.<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nGerta decided to disappear with a few other people from [[Gadrin]] and Hedrett, and form a [[Cularin resistance]] to oppose the Cartel. She emptied her house and traveled to their new base, the [[Cloud Mountain mines]]. Many people, including Wahl, \"disappeared\" like her in the following days, enough to cause a disturbance in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] that was detected by Jedi Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]].<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nGerta became the informal leader of the resistance, with [[Nim'Ri]] and [[Broof Yurdel]] as her chief advisers. She wanted to avoid bloodshed, and was adamant that the resistance would not be the first to initiate deadly force.<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nIndependent gents sent by Master Qel-Bertuk eventually found the resistance base. Haman, Nim'Ri and Yurdel met with them and tried to convince them not to reveal anything about the resistance.<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nOne month later, Haman decided to look for some secret files of the Cartel, specifically reports on how they get their charter for Cularin and their account records of that time, which would specify which Cularin officers were bribed. She obtained speeders for the escape and an advanced, highly-modified datapad (probably a work by famed slicer [[Baylan]]) to extract information from the Cartel's computers, but she also needed someone from outside the resistance to approach the local [[Metatheran Cartel operations office]] in Gadrin. She then asked one of the members of the resistance, [[Corporal/Legends|Corporal]] [[Ortin]] from [[OPS]], to organize a secret meeting with those independent agents at the [[OPS third sector precinct house]]. Haman returned to the secret base of Cloud Mountain mines using a secret way.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nThe operation was a success and the agents went to the mines to give Haman the information. However, some verification file codes were missing, but she discovered they were only available in the well-protected [[Metatheran Cartel jungle base]]. She asked Broof Yurdel and his troops to prepare a raid, and offered the independent agents to cooperate with Yurdel. Noticing that Yurdel was too happy with the assignment, she specifically ordered him to set the weapons in stun. She also asked Kris Wahl to question the independent agents to obtain any information they might have about the jungle base, as they had been previously there.<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\nHowever, the Cartel was tracking the stolen data, and a Cartel-aligned [[Caarite]] force attacked the resistance's secret headquarters. Haman was trapped in the crossfire, but she nevertheless tried to reach her companions. She was then shot in her back and severely wounded. Only the quick actions of some allies of the resistance saved her life.<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\nDue to Haman's critical state, Yurdel was even less prone to use non-lethal force; nevertheless he ordered his troops to set weapons in stun, as it was what Haman would have wanted. Haman did not take part in the following raid against the jungle base, which was a success and led to the Cartel retiring from Cualrin. Soon afterward, governor [[Barnab Chistor]] of Gadrin decorated Haman and the other resistance leaders for their success.<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\nLater, Haman traveled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to meet with Senator [[Lavinia Wren]]. She was being escorted by Jedi General [[Ish-Bel Tur]]. Nevertheless, the ship was destroyed and both she and Tur were killed.<ref name=\"TINYF\">''[[Thaere Is Not Your Friend]]''</ref><ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGerta Haman could die during the events of the RPG adventure ''[[A Revelation]]'' in the mines showdown&mdash;if the player characters behave unheroically, the adventure includes a text about her death as one of the possibilities. However, the adventure ''[[A Mon Alone]]'', which takes place later, provides a different account of her death that apparently overwrites the \"improbable but possible death\" in ''A Revelation''.\n\nThis possible death is probably supposed to be referenced in the \"Critical Event Summary\", so that the majority of official playing parties' performance would become the canon story about that event. However, an apparent typo changed Haman's name for [[Renna (Rodian)|Renna's]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[A Revelation]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20031106thaere|text=Thaere Is Not Your Friend|int=Thaere Is Not Your Friend|archivedate=20091016004647}}\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20031002cularin|text=Cularin at Night|int=Cularin at Night|archivedate=20090603045459}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haman, Gerta}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
