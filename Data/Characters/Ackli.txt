A heavy drinker, Ackli made boastful claims about his [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] spottings. These claims earned him the attention of two [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] treasure hunters hoping to acquire valuable [[Krayt dragon pearl/Legends|Krayt dragon pearls]]. The two treasure hunters paid Ackli to guide them towards the krayt dragons.\n\nWhen [[Dusque Mistflier]] and [[Tendau Nandon]] were uncovered attempting to follow the trio to attain scientific samples from the krayt dragons, Ackli aided in binding and leaving them for dead. The trio received their punishment in turn when three krayt dragons attacked and forced them into the Tatooine desert.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|74|Pearls in the Sand}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ackli\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mon Calamari]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
