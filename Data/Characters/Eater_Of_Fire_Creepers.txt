He received his name must likely because he ate a dangerous insect called [[fire creeper]]s. He had a distrust for the Qom Qae because they did not deliver a message to [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] about the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] \"Threateners\" who had taken up residence on their [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]] as was the agreement between the two peoples. Because of this, when the young son of the Qom Qae Bargainer [[Child Of Winds]] led Skywalker to Qom Jha territory in an attempt to find his \"captured\" friend [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], Eater Of Fire Creepers distrusted Child Of Winds and blamed him for his people's failure.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\nDespite his animosity for the Qom Qae, Skywalker and Jade successfully negotiated with Eater Of Fire Creepers for the Qom Jha's aid in entering the \"Threatener\" base. He sent along three guides, [[Builder With Vines]], [[Splitter Of Stones]] and [[Keeper Of Promises]] to help them. After the two [[Human/Legends|Humans]] and Child Of Winds had aided them in their [[Mission to Nirauan|struggle]] with the Chiss, they relieved the debt that was owed to them; Eater Of Fire Creepers later met with [[Hunter Of Winds]], who both agreed that Luke and Mara should leave and that there should be peace between the two Nirauan native groups.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEater Of Fire Creepers first appeared in the [[1998]] novel ''[[Vision of the Future]]'' written by [[Timothy Zahn]].<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nirauan residents]]\n[[Category:Qom Jha and Qom Qae]]"}}}]}}}}
