They have been friends since childhood. My men have already spoken with Chelah and she has provided no useful information, but you are welcome to question her yourself.|A'jidre Skrigatov mentions Chelah Voh to his hired bounty hunters|Abregado-Rae Intrigue}}\n'''Chelah Voh''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Ho'Din/Legends|Ho'Din]] who became caught up in the hunt for the missing [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] [[Brinaloy N'Vaari]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. A resident of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Abregado-rae/Legends|Abregado-rae]], Voh was close friends with N'Vaari, the granddaughter of a [[Provincial Governor]] of the Abregado-rae resort [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Le Yer]]. N'Vaari went into hiding to avoid a forced [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]] to her [[N'Vaari|grandfather's]] successor, [[A'jidre Skrigatov]]. Skrigatov had hoped to gain politically from the marriage, and hired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] to track down the wayward Devaronian. Voh's friendship with N'Vaari led the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunters to question the Ho'Din in the hope of finding a lead to their quarry's whereabouts.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Le_Yer.png|thumb|right|Chelah Voh was a resident of Le Yer on Abregado-rae.]]\nChelah Voh was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Ho'Din/Legends|Ho'Din]] and a resident of [[Le Yer]], a resort [[City/Legends|town]] on the otherwise shabby manufacturing [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Abregado-rae/Legends|Abregado-rae]]. From childhood, Voh was the closest friend of [[Brinaloy N'Vaari]], a [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] who was the granddaughter of a [[Provincial Governor]] of Le Yer. In the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] prior to the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Voh maintained an apartment on the outskirts of Le Yer; the house was surrounded by large flowering bushes and shrubs.<ref name=\"ND\" />\n\nThe town of Le Yer was ensnared in political strife when the [[Death/Legends|death]] of N'Vaari's [[N'Vaari|grandfather]] was ordered by the Devaronian [[A'jidre Skrigatov]], a local criminal leader who had been elected the next Provincial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]]. N'Vaari confided in Voh that she was scared she would be killed next; Skrigatov, however, had subtler plans and instead, after five years had passed, sought to [[Marriage/Legends|marry]] N'Vaari to shore up support for his re-election. Aware that the local [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|constabulary]] were corrupt and supported Skrigatov, N'Vaari went into hiding five days before the ceremony was scheduled to take place.<ref name=\"ND\" />\n\n{{RPG|\"[[Abregado-Rae Intrigue]]\"}}\nVoh, known to be N'Vaari's best friend, was aggressively questioned by Skrigatov's lackey, [[Friizt]], but provided the [[Herglic/Legends|Herglic]] with no useful information. Skrigatov then pressured several [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] from offworld to search for the missing Devaronian. The [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunters approached Voh, but she correctly deduced from their appearance that they were more of Skrigatov's employees and thus refused to cooperate; she slammed her door in their faces. The bounty hunters, however, were able to obtain from within Voh's apartment a [[claim ticket]] for N'Vaari's [[Droid/Legends|droid]], [[MK221]]. With that as a lead, the bounty hunters eventually discovered that N'Vaari had disguised herself as a male [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]], and they tracked her to [[Phyrstal Island]].<ref name=\"ND\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nChelah Voh was a tall and slim Ho'Din,<ref name=\"ND\" /> a [[Reptile/Legends|reptilian]] [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] [[Species/Legends|species]] distinguished by tresses of vibrantly-[[Color/Legends|colored]] head tendrils.<ref name=\"GG4\">''[[Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races]]''</ref> While she appeared shy and withdrawn, Voh was strong willed and resisted pressure from Skrigatov's lackey. She cared deeply about her friend N'Vaari, and the Devaronian trusted her in return, revealing the existence of a hideout in Le Yer, though not its location. Voh was aware of her limited abilities in combat and was therefore unwilling to enter situations that might lead to fighting. The Ho'Din had some experience at business.<ref name=\"ND\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nChelah Voh was created by [[Sandra Childress]] and [[Christopher John Parks]] for their [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying adventure]] \"[[Abregado-Rae Intrigue]].\" [[West End Games]] published the adventure in [[1997]] as part of [[No Disintegrations (West End Games)|''No Disintegrations'']], a collection of adventures for bounty hunter characters. The adventures are set prior to the Battle of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], although it is possible to rework them for later periods. Voh is given abbreviated statistics, which highlight her knowledge, business and perception proficiencies.\n\nThe adventure presents several reactions from Chelah Voh depending on how the player characters interact with the Ho'Din. This article presents the adventure as unfolding according to the first stated option, but any of the following outcomes are also possible. If the players approach Voh wearing heavy [[Armor/Legends|armor]] or carrying [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], or let on that they are either hunting N'Vaari or working for Skrigatov, Voh reacts angrily and slams the door on the characters. If that occurs, the adventure suggests the players may obtain the droid ticket claim by breaking into her apartment. Alternatively, if the players present a credible cover story, such as a desire to smuggle N'Vaari offworld, Voh readily cooperates and provides them with the droid ticket claim.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=No Disintegrations (West End Games)|text=''No Disintegrations''|story=Abregado-Rae Intrigue}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voh, Chelah}}\n[[Category:Abregado-rae]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ho'Din]]"}}}]}}}}
