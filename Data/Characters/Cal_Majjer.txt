He was generally a grumpy old man, and was used to getting his own way. He employed young [[Caarite]]s as stockboys, providing them with the work experience they would need to work for the [[Metatheran Cartel]]. He also employed [[Nyrkar]] the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] as his food preservation specialist and dietary consultant. Although Nyrkar was an employee, Majjer called him \"my Wookiee\".\n\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Nyrkar disappeared to join the [[Cularin resistance]]. Majjer then reported that several employees had disappeared, hoping that more people being missing would be more likely to get the [[Office of Peace and Security]]'s attention. He felt it didn't matter if the rest of his employees went missing, as Nyrkar was the one that really counted, his disappearance setting the company back thousands of credits.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Cal Majjer\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Majjer, Cal}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
