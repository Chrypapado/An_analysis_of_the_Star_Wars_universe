He was the head of the [[Drogheda Mining Company]], and he had set up his eldest daughter, Sarna to take over the company. When [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] began to dote on his daughter, Sarna's father became very suspicious, being very protective of his daughter and his wealth. He eventually surmised that Calrissian was planning to marry his daughter in order to get at the family's wealth, as well as their booming mining industry. To stop Calrissian from carrying out his plan, he banished the man from his world and from his daughter.\n\nYears later, at some point following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Calrissian was summoned back to Drogheda by the now [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] Sarna. Sarna's father had passed away by this point.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 83|''Star Wars'' 83]] {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Drogheda residents]]\n[[Category:Monarchs]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified royalty]]"}}}]}}}}
