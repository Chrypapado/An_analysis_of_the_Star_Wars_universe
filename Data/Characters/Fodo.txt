Both served as replacements for the previous two Bith brothers [[Ujaa]] and [[Ujii]] who left when the lead singer [[Elinda]] found Ujaa's lackluster music skills intolerable.\n\nThis second incarnation of the Twisted Rancor Trio began to rise to fame around the year [[3956 BBY]], being especially popular on its [[Planet/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] as a result of Elinda's voice. The group's big break seemed to have arrived when they were invited to perform for the local businessman [[Davik Kang]] at his [[Davik Kang's estate|estate]]. However, while Uksaris was ecstatic for this opportunity, Elinda objected on the grounds that Kang was heavily rumored to be connected with the crime syndicate the [[Exchange]]. In fears that their lives could be in danger should their performance be unsatisfactory to Kang, Elinda opted out, and Uksaris replaced her with her sister [[Ashana]] on the eve of their scheduled performance.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFodo only appears as a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' as a part of a puzzle that the player, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], can solve in order to crack a security crate booby-trapped with a [[Holo-Sec Corp]] [[Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive|anti-theft explosive]]. The player must activate the six [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojectors]] of the members of the Twisted Rancor Trio surrounding the crate in order of their recruitment. The solution is given in the [[datapad]] lying on a nearby table of Uksaris's ''[[Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio]]'' detailing the history of the band.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fodo\n|nl=Fodo\n|pl=Fodo\n|fi=Fodo\n|ru=\u0424\u043e\u0434\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bith]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Twisted Rancor Trio Band Members]]"}}}]}}}}
