He was also the brother of [[Cindel Towani]].\n\n==Biography==\nAround [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], the time of the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]], [[Towani family star cruiser|his family's ship]] made a crash-landing on the forest [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. After his parents went missing, he and his sister Cindel befriended a nearby tribe of [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] to help rescue his parents. With the help of [[Logray/Legends|Logray's]] [[magic rock]], he discovered that his parents had been kidnapped by the [[Gorax/Legends|Gorax]], and taken to his lair. Mace and Cindel rescued their parents and returned to the village, where everyone celebrated. Jeremitt eventually began working on repairing the crashed star cruiser.<ref name=\"CoC:AEA\">''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]''</ref>\n\nLater, when Jeremitt's repairs were nearing completion, a group of the [[Sanyassan Marauders]] [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|attacked the Ewok village]], killing many. Mace was killed by an explosion while hiding in a hut, with Jeremitt and Catarine also dying. This left Cindel alone with the Ewoks and [[Noa Briqualon]]&mdash;an old hermit who was a former [[Scout/Legends|scout]]. With them, Cindel embarked on a journey to the Marauders' castle, in order to avenge her family, and defeat the Marauders, while rescuing those Ewoks who had been captured. Following the battle, she and Briqualon left the forest moon.<ref name=\"E:TBfE\">''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the two Ewok films, ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'', Mace Towani was portrayed by [[Eric Walker]].<ref name=\"CoC:AEA\" /><ref name=\"E:TBfE\" /> The name \"Mace\" actually dates back to the earliest incarnation of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'']], a 13-page treatment written by [[George Lucas]] in [[1973]] called ''[[Journal of the Whills, Part I]]''.<ref>''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Ewoks and the Lost Children]]''\n*[[The Ewok Adventure (book-and-record)|''The Ewok Adventure'' (book-and-record)]]\n*''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''\n*[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Mace Towani}}\n*''[[George Lucas: The Creative Impulse]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|32|Caravan of Courage: Star Wars on Television|''Caravan of Courage'': ''Star Wars'' on Television}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/feature20081201.html|text=Castaways of Endor|int=Castaways of Endor}} {{Imo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|94|The Empire Strikes Fact!}}\n*{{InsiderCite|107|A Long Time Ago....}}\n*{{InsiderCite|110|Warriors of Endor}}\n*{{DB|character|cindeltowani|Towani, Cindel|archivedate=20100202232919}}\n*{{DB|character|macetowani|Towani, Mace|archivedate=20100906072858}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|143|Memoirs of an Ewok}} {{Po}}\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Galactic Files Series 2|cardname=Mace Towani (Endor Caravan)}}\n*{{SW|url=news/drawing-from-the-imagination-mythological-creatures-in-star-wars-part-1|int=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in Star Wars|text=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in ''Star Wars'', Part 1}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mace Towani\n|nl=Mace Towani\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Towani, Mace}}\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
