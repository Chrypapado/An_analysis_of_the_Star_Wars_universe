A [[Speciesism|speciesist]], he loathed [[Etahn A'baht]], and opposed his appointment as [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] of the [[New Republic Fifth Fleet|Fifth Battle Group]]. He also supported [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo's]] appointment as commander of the combined forces in the [[Farlax sector]], believing that Solo was currently doing nothing useful. He accidentally allowed [[Tig Peramis]] to learn of [[Leia Organa Solo|Organa Solo's]] plan to send Solo to the fleet. Some time after Bakura left the New Republic, Cundertol was elected [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] of [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]].\n\nDuring the period of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] prior to [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], he learned the [[Ssi-ruu]]k had perfected the [[entechment]] process, and offered to help them invade Bakura a second time in exchange for being enteched and placed within a [[Human replica droid]]. After being placed in a droid that perfectly resembled him, Cundertol's plan failed when the [[Keeramak]]&mdash;leader of the Ssi-ruuk&mdash;was killed. He fled to a station on the remote fringes of the [[Ssi-ruuvi Imperium]] where he discovered that the Ssi-ruu [[E'thinaa]], who he had dealt with, was actually a [[Yuuzhan Vong]]. E'thinaa then killed him.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shield of Lies]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Or Die Trying}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] of [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]]\n|years=c.
