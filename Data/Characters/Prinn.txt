However, a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]] of [[Darth Baras]] managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup mode&mdash;cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\n\nPrinn, Organa, Blenks, and Kan'grell encountered the [[Sith Warrior]] after the apprentice slaughtered all their troops. Organa decided to make an offer to the Sith, which he refused. The Sith, who was looking for information about Organa's former handmaiden Jaesa Willsaam, started to torture Blenks, who was Organa's lover. Refusing to watch him [[Death/Legends|die]], Organa revealed that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Jaesa Willsaam]]'s [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were still servants at [[Castle Organa]]. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Wrath executed Organa and her bodyguards, including Prinn, for defying the Empire.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
