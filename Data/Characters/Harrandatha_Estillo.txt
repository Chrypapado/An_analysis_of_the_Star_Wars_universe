He screamed of how he wanted to watch as they slit my throat, and then he would be Emperor.|Plourr Ilo|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Warrior Princess}}\nThe son and heir-apparent of the reigning monarch, [[Uthorrferrell Cartha]], Harran had a vicious, psychotic personality, and from boyhood supported the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. His personal hero was [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], and on a visit to Eiattu, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] molded the young prince as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and proxy, using mental manipulation to transform his hot-blooded sadism into something cold and calculating.\n\nDuring Harran's childhood, the Eiattauan nobility overthrew the royal family and sent them into internal exile, forming a ruling council, known as the [[Priamsta]], to govern in their stead. A faction of the Priamsta resolved to murder the dynasty, but Harran was killed not by the nobles or their agents, but rather by his sister, [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Plourr]], who he attempted to stop from escaping so that he could watch her die. Plourr clubbed him to death with a rock, and left his body in the bush for the [[Thuvasaur]]s to eat.\n\n==The false Harran==\n{{Quote|This false Harran truly believes that he ''is'' Harran. He has all of the true Harran's memories. He believes in his cause, but more in the power the PLB will give him.

This false prince was exposed by the returned Plourr, who took the leadership of her people after the expulsion of the Empire. Harran's ring hand was blasted away in a firefight, and he was reduced to a catatonic state, his mind destroyed.\n\n[[File:False_Harran.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The false Harran.]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 14|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 14]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|8|ComicScan|ComicScan: Taken by Force}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{C|Under ''Asrandatha Estillo''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Harrandatha Estillo\n|nl=Harran\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Estillo, Harrandatha}}\n[[Category:Eiattuans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Royal family of Eiattu 6]]"}}}]}}}}
