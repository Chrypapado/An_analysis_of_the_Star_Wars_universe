He was a megalomaniac, running his own illegal operations from [[Fortress of Tawntoom|his fortress]], including theft and hijacking. He was also an expert in political intrigue. Throughout his final months of life he was constantly thwarted in his efforts to gain the favor of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Terrinald Screed/Legends|Terrinald Screed]] by the merchant [[Mungo Baobab]] and his droids [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]].\n\n==Biography==\nAt some point prior to [[15 BBY/Legends|15 BBY]] Koong along with his lieutenant [[Gaff]] seized control of [[Roon/Legends|Roon]] with his personal army and made himself de facto Governor of the [[Tawntoom]] province. He then proceeded to amass a small fortune after he took control of one of the lightstations in the [[The Cloak of the Sith|Cloak of the Sith]], purposely crashing ships that tried to travel through the dust cloud and recovering the debris to extract valuables to be sold on the black market; such as ship parts, [[Nergon-14/Legends|Nergon-14]], and [[Mupple]].\n\nEager to become allied with the Empire, Koong made a deal with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Terrinald Screed/Legends|Terrinald Screed]] to supply the Empire with valuable [[Roonstone]]s in return to maintain his strong financial position and semi-autonomy over Roon. When Koong salvaged the ''[[Caravel]]'', a ship belonging to [[Mungo Baobab]], he believed the merchant was one of Screed's lieutenants and proceeded to show him the workings of his operations. Only when Screed himself arrived to observe Koong's operation, did Koong realize he had been tricked and Baobab and his droids, [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], were arrested. Baobab managed to escape, inflicting damage to the lightstation and causing it to crash into an asteroid.\n\n[[File:ScreedKoong-TRG.png|thumb|left|200px|Governor Koong and Admiral Screed]]\nDesperate to prove himself to the Empire after the failure of his previous scheme, Koong determined to crush resistance in the [[Umboo|Umboo Province]]. To this end, he attempted to fix the [[Roon Colonial Games]] so that his Tawntoom team beat the Umboo team and crush rebel spirits. His attempt failed due to the intervention of Mungo Baobab.\n\nLater, Koong used the [[Rooze Disease]] to try and poison the Umboo Province, but accidentally infected himself as well. The renowned doctor, [[Nilz Yomm]], was captured and forced to develop a cure for the germ, but Baobab stole it and freed the doctor. Baobab made a deal to exchange the cure and the location of the [[Roonstone]] treasure for his ship and Koong's promise to leave Umboo alone. However, Screed double-crossed Koong, taking control of Roon and seizing the treasure.\n\nKoong made an unsuccessful attempt to kill Baobab and the Imperials but succumbed to his illness before he could use the cure and he died.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKoong was fairly short and stocky compared to most Humans and possessed an ample paunch, which along with his five o'clock shadow and unbuttoned upper shirt gave him an unkempt appearance. His hair was cut in a buzzcut and spoke with a gruff voice.\n\nKoong wore a green uniform with a red belt, red boots, and gold epaulets. This uniform style was shared with the soldiers under his command.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn \"[[The Roon Games]]\", Koong was animated with only four fingers per hand instead of five.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DroidsCite|Tail of the Roon Comets}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Escape from the Monster Ship: A Droid Adventure]]'' {{C|Adaptation of \"Tail of the Roon Comets\"}}\n*{{DroidsCite|The Roon Games}}\n*{{DroidsCite|Across the Roon Sea}}\n*{{DroidsCite|The Frozen Citadel}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080522/index.html|text=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|int=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-lando-calrissian-idiots-array.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Droids (toy line)|''Star Wars: Droids'' toy line]] {{C|Cut}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Action Figure Archive]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid]]''\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|92|The Toys That Never Were}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|128|Proto Power!}}\n*{{DB|character|gaff|Gaff|archivedate=20100209222815}}\n*{{DB|character|governorkoong|Koong, Governor|archivedate=20100209194857}}\n*{{DB|character|admiralscreed|Screed, Admiral|archivedate=20100210020053}}\n*{{DB|character|aurenyomm|Yomm, Auren|archivedate=20100209233520}}\n*{{DB|location|roon|Roon|archivedate=20100602093232}}\n*{{SW|url=news/droids-and-ewoks-return-spains-lost-star-wars-comic-strips|text=Droids and Ewoks Return: Spain's Lost ''Star Wars'' Comic Strips}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-2|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 2|int=The Droids Re-Animated}} {{1stID|Bisad}}\n*{{SW|url=news/offscreen-but-not-forgotten-mini-rigs-body-rigs-and-other-kenner-vehicles|text=Offscreen, but Not Forgotten: Mini-Rigs, Body-Rigs, and Other Kenner Vehicles}}\n*{{SW|url=news/this-is-podracing-sports-in-the-star-wars-galaxy-part-1|text=This Is Podracing: Sports in the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy, Part 1|int=Sports in the Star Wars Galaxy}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Koong\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koong, Bisad}}\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Roon residents]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
