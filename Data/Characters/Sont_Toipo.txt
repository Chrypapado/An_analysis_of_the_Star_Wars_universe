Drik says he's a troublemaker, and Drik knows best.|Sont Toipo, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> Drik Bandrik, a slaver who became upset at [[Kitster Chanchani Banai|Kitster Banai]] for his persistent attempts to improve the lives of slaves, framed him in the murder of a [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]] named [[Krin Vel]]. Sont Toipo was then tasked with organizing an angry mob of farmers to find and kill Kitster. Fortunately for Kitster, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] traveling through [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] agreed to help him, and hunt down Sont Toipo. Kitster surmised that the mob would consist of six or eight local moisture farmers, but he pleaded with the spacer to only kill Sont Toipo. Kitster hoped that the rest of the mob would run off after he was killed.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nThe traveler agreed, and set out to successfully kill Toipo, while making an effort to spare the lives of the farmers. It later turned out that Krin Vel was not murdered at all, but was rather paid by Drik Bandrik to leave Mos Espa long enough for a lynch mob to be formed.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ToughThugAqualishMaleTemplate.jpg|250px|thumb|Possible depictions of Sont Toipo]]\nSont Toipo was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'',<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Players who performed a series of quests for Kitster in Mos Espa had to hunt down and kill Sont Toipo outside the [[City/Legends|city]].<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Kitster Banai}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toipo, Sont}}\n[[Category:Aqualish]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
