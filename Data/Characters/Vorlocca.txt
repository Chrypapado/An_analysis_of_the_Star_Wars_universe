Circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], Vorlocca and five other [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] were [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|attacked]] by the [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]], the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Karae Nalvas]], and a number of Mon's minions, who planned to enter the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]] to search for the secrets of the creation of [[Sith battlelord]]s. Vorlocca was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during the fight, and the attackers subsequently dragged the Wookiee's corpse inside the fortress, where they fed it to three [[Gundark/Legends|gundarks]]. His body was later discovered by a [[Heroes of Cularin|search team]] that had traveled to the fortress to look for any Jedi who had survived the attack.\n\n==Biography==\nVorlocca was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who served as a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], attaining the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. At some point, he became a member of a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] force that was [[Garrison/Legends|garrisoned]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]] outside the [[Almas Sith fortress]] to keep the [[Believers]],<ref name=\"AMA\" /> a [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] that operated in the [[Cularin system]],<ref name=\"CA\">''[[Caaried Away]]''</ref> from entering the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]],<ref name=\"AMA\" /> which had previously served as a Believer base.<ref name=\"ADF\">''[[A Dark Fortress]]''</ref> While the majority of the fortress's Jedi guards were stationed to the north of the building, Vorlocca was one of six Jedi who were assigned to protect the facility's south entrance.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nDuring a [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]]<ref name=\"AMA\" /> circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\" /> the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]], the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Karae Nalvas]], and a number of Mon's minions traveled to the south entrance to access the fortress, where they planned to search for the secrets of the creation of ancient [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Soldier/Legends|warriors]] known as [[Sith battlelord]]s. Mon's forces [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|attacked]] Vorlocca and the other five Jedi guards; during the ensuing fight, Vorlocca and the Jedi [[Tresten Agai'i]], [[K'kur]], and [[Milak Sonloam]] were [[Death/Legends|killed]], while the other two Jedi defenders were captured, allowing Mon and Nalvas to enter the fortress. The attackers dragged Vorlocca's body inside the building and abandoned it in a slave pen in the lower levels of the fortress to be eaten by three [[Gundark/Legends|gundarks]] that Mon had brought with him into the facility.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Jedi discovered the bodies of Agaai'i, K'kur, and Sonloam, and they dispatched a number of search parties into the fortress to try and find Vorlocca and the two captured Jedi. Two [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] after Vorlocca's death, one [[Heroes of Cularin|search team]] made its way to the lower levels of the fortress, where it located his corpse and observed as one of the gundarks shredded the Wookiee's body and fed from it.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nVorlocca was a very skilled Jedi Knight who could have qualified as a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] if he had desired to do so. He was chosen to guard the south entrance of the Sith fortress because of his exceptional abilities, as the Jedi knew less about the south entrance than they did about the building's other entrances. Vorlocca was more physically powerful than his fellow guards Tresten Agai'i, K'kur, and Milak Sonloam.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|An empty vessel? Unlikely.|Darsin, if the player characters ask him whether Vorlocca's body had been separated from its Force essence|A Mon Alone}}\nVorlocca was created by [[Morrie Mullins (person)|Morrie Mullins]] and was featured in the [[2004]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[A Mon Alone]]'', a supplement that formed part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign. In the adventure, the player-characters, who [[Roleplaying game|roleplay]] as the search party that discovers Vorlocca's corpse, find a number of individuals inside the Sith fortress who have had their [[The Force/Legends|Force]] essences separated from their bodies as a result of Phylus Mon's attempts to carry out a ritual relating to the creation of Sith battlelords. It is then possible for the players to ask the [[Force ghost]] [[Darsin]] if Vorlocca's body had also been separated from its Force essence, to which the spirit replies is unlikely. It is also possible for the player-characters to take Vorlocca's body with them when they leave the fortress. If they choose to do so, the cadaver is then loaded onto a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] with the player-characters and is taken to the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] that was located on Almas.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]'' {{1st}} {{C|Corpse}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
