He became a leader in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He hailed from [[Corellia]] and became a smuggler, even completing the [[Kessel Run]] in just twelve [[parsec]]s with his prized [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and coming under the employ of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]]. He was the son-in-law of fallen [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], husband of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], brother-in-law of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Parent|father]] of [[Ben Solo]], rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], and best friends with the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], his trusted [[Pilot|copilot]] who swore a [[life debt]] to the [[Corellian]] smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of [[spice]] to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of [[Credit|money]] as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and the [[droid]]s [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to [[Alderaan]], but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Princess Leia Organa [[Rescue of Princess Leia|escape]] from the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], briefly fought in the [[Battle of Yavin]], which allowed Skywalker to destroy the [[superweapon]]. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of [[Standard year|years]] afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hoth]], Solo sought refuge with Organa&mdash;with whom he had fallen in love&mdash;Chewbacca, and C-3PO on [[Cloud City]], which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the [[city]]. Solo was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] and taken to [[Jabba's Palace]] on [[Tatooine]] by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], where he remained encased in carbonite for [[Standard month|months]] until he was [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescued]] by his friends. After returning to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], Solo was promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[general]] and was given command of the [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders]], a [[special forces]] [[squad]], for the [[Battle of Endor]]. Solo led the Pathfinders to [[Endor]], where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s, destroyed the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] protecting the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] that was being constructed in [[orbit]]. Their actions allowed the Alliance [[Fleet]] to destroy the superweapon.\n\nThe Battle of Endor, which saw the [[death]]s of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the [[New Republic]]. In the early [[Standard day|days]] after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He [[Marriage|married]] Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the [[dark side of the Force]]&mdash;like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was [[Force-sensitive]]&mdash;so Organa sent him to be [[Jedi training|trained]] as a [[Jedi]] by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by [[Snoke]], [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]], resulting in the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the [[Jedi Order]].\n\nHaving lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the ''Millennium Falcon'' to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] and a defected First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] named [[Finn]], who carried with them a droid, [[BB-8]], that had part of a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to Skywalker's [[Ahch-To|location]]. Solo, who retrieved the ''Falcon'' from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the [[Resistance]] against the First Order, and fought in the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|battle]] to destroy the First Order superweapon known as [[Starkiller Base]]. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon. However, Solo's memory remained alive and appeared in a [[Force vision]] a [[35 ABY|year later]] to convince Ren to abandon the dark side and defeat the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, after a [[Mission to Kef Bir|duel]] on the [[Death Star ruins|remains]] of the second Death Star between Rey and Ren, being enough for Ben Solo to return and eventually [[Battle of Exegol|sacrifice his own life]] to rescue Rey.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I came up running scams on the streets of Corellia.|Han Solo, to Tobias Beckett|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}\nHan was born on the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]<ref name=\"Ultimate\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> in [[32 BBY]].<ref name=\"Birth year\" /> Sometime after he became famous, it would be rumored by an [[Snivvian]] [[bounty hunter]] that Han was actually a descendant of the [[Prince-Admiral]] [[Jonashe Solo]], a member of the ancient [[Corellian royalty]].<ref name=\"TFV\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref> During his formative years, [[Han Solo's father|his father]] worked in the [[Corellian Engineering Corporation]] [[shipyard]]s, building vessels such as [[YT-1300 light freighter]]s until he was laid off. Solo's father wished he could leave Corellia on such a ship, but was never able to afford to. According to Han, he was never close with his father.<ref name=\"Solo\" /> At one point his father brought him to the freighter factory where he worked and pointed out to the young Han that the ships being built there were his contributions to [[the galaxy]], but that they ultimately didn't matter.

Here, Han met fellow scrumrat [[Qi'ra]].<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Despite being in service to the gang, Han showed considerable defiance towards them and their methods. One day, he intervened as a smaller child was attacked by a group of bullies, which led to Han getting beaten as well. Afterwards, Qi'ra asked Han why he helped the child despite not getting anything in return. Han answered that while that might be how the galaxy works, it didn't always have to be that way.<ref name=\"Star Wars 18 (2020)\">[[Star Wars (2020) 18|''Star Wars'' (2020) 18]]</ref>\n\nWhen Han was about the age of eighteen, Han and Qi'ra were vying for the position of [[Head (White Worms)|Head]] within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Han and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the [[Kaldana Syndicate]], as well as the Empire. Han had acquired a [[Data cube|datacube]] with plans for a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] that was desired by all the factions. Han and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Han's recommendation to [[Lord|Lady]] [[Proxima]]. As they later ate together, Han asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.<ref name=\"Most Wanted\" />\n\n[[File:DenOfTheWhiteWorms-Databank.jpg|thumb|left|223x223px|Han and Qi'ra before they escape Lady Proxima]]\nSometime later, Han and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Acting under orders from Lady Proxima, Han set up a deal with some individuals to exchange [[coaxium]] for credits. Qi'ra suggested that Han shouldn't go alone, but both Proxima and Han disagreed with her. Upon meeting with the individuals, Han got into a fight with them due to having not abided by their stated terms and proceeded to escape with an<ref name=\"Solo 1\">[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 1|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 1]]</ref> extremely valuable vial of coaxium, as well as a speeder. Han attempted to take Qi'ra with him, but both were captured by the White Worms, and brought before crime boss Lady Proxima. Han threw a rock through a window, allowing the sunlight to burn Proxima's skin.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Qi'ra_escape_Corellia.jpg|thumb|right|248x248px|Han and Qi'ra escaping the White Worms]]\nIn the confusion, Han and Qi'ra escaped to the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] checkpoint, where they used the coaxium to bribe the officer on duty to let them through. Han was able to make it through, but at that moment Qi'ra was spotted and the officer closed the doors. As Qi'ra was pulled away, Han promised to come back to save her. Qi'ra was captured by the White Worms, and Han began to try to find a way to save her. As he looked around the center, he spotted an Imperial recruitment center.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n===Serving under the Galactic Empire===\n====Becoming \"Han Solo\"====\n{{Quote|Good luck Han Solo.

When asked what his last name was, Han responded that he did not have a people and was alone. Due to this he was assigned the name \"Solo\" by [[Imperial Recruitment Officer|recruitment officer]] [[Drawd Munbrin]]. His goal was to become a skilled pilot and eventually return to Corellia to find Qi'ra.<ref name=\"Solo 1\" />\n\n====Life as an Imperial cadet====\n{{Quote|TIE fighters.

When Han arrived, [[droid]]s stripped all his [[clothing]] off. Right after, different droids gave him his new [[Imperial cadet]] suit and also shaved him. Han entered a room filled with many other cadets. Here a [[Gender|female]] [[Imperial officer]] named [[Triosa Broog]] was speaking over them. Soon after, he tried to greet a cadet, who told Han to shut up. Han realized that when he said shut up, he used Han's cadet name, and you were only known as numbers at the Imperial Academy. Later Han was practicing on a battlefield as an [[Imperial Army trooper]] and wondered how this was supposed to help him in [[pilot]] training. Broog overheard Han. Han then raised his hand, and Broog called him a [[Corellian]] [[worm]]. Broog asked what his name was. They had a short conversation about his name. Broog then suggested to the other cadets that they show Han how basic training is supposed to help flying by hiking up a mountain twice.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 1\">[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Han_can_explain.png|thumb|left|265x265px|Stormtroopers surround Han after crashing the TIE fighter.]]\nImmediately after, the cadets started to beat Han up. During this, cadet 404-913,<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 1\" /> named [[Beilert Valance]],<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 4\" /> began to insult Han before cadet [[Kanina Nico|803-308]] told them to let him go. Han thanked her for the help and asked for the name of the cadet but refused to say. Right after, two cadets, [[Lyttan Dree]] and [[Tamu Dree]], were talking about why they joined the Empire. They also asked Han why he had signed up, with Solo simply replying that he had to get off Corellia. Lyttan and Tamu said that he would never learn how to fly at the academy and that they might send him to a wretched place like [[Urthak]] or [[Mimban]]. Han was thinking about what they said and thought that he should do something deeply stupid. Han then snuck into a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] hanger and stole a fighter. Han eventually crashed the TIE, leading to [[stormtrooper]]s surrounding Han at the crash site.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 1\" />\n\nAfter the crash Han was [[Prison|imprisoned]]. He eventually got out because of his great piloting skills. Fourteen days later, Nico, who was cadet 803-308, was one of the top of the leader board. Suddenly Han came upon Lyttan and Tamu, who were surprised about Nico topping the leader board. Lyttan and Tamu were surprised that Han survived the crash. The cadets had started a bet about Solo's fate, with one of the Dree brothers winning.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 2\">[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 2|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 2]]</ref>\n\nSoon after, Han was bullied by 404-913, who started a fight with Han. Eventually Han was beaten, and Valance went to hurt Lyttan and Tamu, but Han kicked Valance in the crotch before he could do so. Han then smashed Valance in his face with a [[Foodstuff|food]] tray. Valance was about to punch Han in the face, but before he could, Imperial troopers arrived and asked what was going on. but they told a lie instead of what really happened. Han suggested that Valance and Han should start over. Han told Valance his name, but Valance refused to give his. He said to look on the leader board to find out. Han looked and saw that Valance was the top one on the board. Soon after, Han said he could not believe that the academy let Valance actually become the top one. Nico came up behind Han and said she wondered how long he would last. She was also surprised that Han survived the crash. Tamu then told Han that there was no way Han was moving to top of the leader board. Han disagreed.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 2\" />\n\n[[File:Han_saves_Tamu_Dree.jpg|thumb|194x194px|right|Han saves Tamu Dree during training.]]\nLater during flight school, Han asked the instructor if there would be flying at any point. It took [[time]], but eventually Han entered the cockpit of a TIE fighter. He made it to third place on the leader board. During a another flight class, the teacher [[Yurib Nakan]], told the class to work in pairs and destroy a cannon's shield. Han and Tamu were partners for this exercise. Tamu's fighter was damaged, and Han saved him. When the training was over, Lyttan thanked Han for saving his brother's life. Soon after, a cadet came to Lyttan and said that he broke off before he could get a shot. Yurib then said that everyone failed the training. Han's actions of saving a cadet could have given Han a chance to become the best pilot the Galactic Empire had ever seen, but Han's fellow cadets might kill Han before he could do so. Solo claimed they should have earned partial credit since the team worked together.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 2\" />\n\nSolo and the other cadets were ordered to make soup for the all the cadets. During the night, Solo snuck out of his bunk and cleaned the floors in the [[refresher]], but logged Valance as having done all the assignments. As a result, the next morning, Solo and the other cadets were assigned to the [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class carrier]] [[Imperial Cruiser 07200823|cruiser 07200823]] by Yurib. Their orders were to transport several TIE fighter pilots. During the voyage, Solo was able to modify the cruiser's speed to give him and the cadets a day off. Solo also revealed he had day passes and told them there was a [[Pantolomin cruiser]] nearby they could visit and gave them civilian clothes. Despite Nico's objections, Solo was able to convince them to leave the cruiser.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 3\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Pjolan.jpg|thumb|242x242px|left|Pjolan pulls a blaster on Han.]]\nAboard the cruiser, Solo told his fellow cadets to have some fun. Solo played [[sabacc]] with Nico and attempted to learn her reasons for joining the Imperial Navy. Nico refused to tell him why and deduced how Solo pulled off the excursion. She also noticed him eyeing an Ithorian. Solo was soon left to himself and met up with Pjolan. Solo attempted to drink an [[Ithorian ale]] to no avail. Han also asked Pjolan about Qi'ra. Pjolan said nothing, indicating that Qi'ra was still alive, but told Solo that Lady Proxima had a 200-credit bounty on him, so he pulled a blaster on Han. He was saved by Nico, and the two of them went to get Lyttan and Tamu. Pjolan attempted to collect Solo's bounty, but Solo was able to inform [[Black Sun]], the cruiser's owners, about Pjolan, and the cartel captured him. Solo and the other cadets were allowed to leave with their thanks. Solo and the others were able to return cruiser 07200823 to Carida's academy. Upon their return, they were reinstated to full flight status. Later the cadets were told by Yurib to come to the training room the next evening.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 3\" />\n\nAfter Solo completed his training he was stationed on the<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 4\" /> planet<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 5\">[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 5|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 5]]</ref> [[Qhulosk]], where he became part of [[Carida Squadron]] and was sent to fight a [[Battle of Howlan|battle]] for the Empire at [[Howlan]]. During the battle, Valance was shot down by [[Homeworld|native]] [[Qhuloskian]]s, but the skirmish resulted in an Imperial victory. Yurib ordered the squadron to return to [[Imperial Navy Mobile Base|base]]. Solo refused and wanted to help Valance. Yurib responded that Valance was gone and told Solo to abort. Three enemy fighters came and fired at Carida Squadron, killing one of the TIEs. Eventually, the squadron defeated the fighters and fled back to base. When they arrived, Solo spoke to Yurib about why he could not save Valance. Yurib said that [[TIE/sa bomber|TIE bombers]] would wipe out the entire city soon and there was no time to rescue Valance. Solo became mad and set off to rescue Valance alone. Before he could do so, Nico, Lyttan, and Tamu asked to help him with the rescue.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 4\" />\n\n[[File:ImperialCadet5-B-textless.png|thumb|right|180px|Han Solo, Imperial Navy cadet]]\nPer the plan, Yurib sent a bombing run to the city. One officer recognized that six people had left the base and six speeders were also missing. The officer revealed this to Yurib, but Yurib didn't respond. During the rescue, Solo, Nico, Tamu, and Lyttan were being shot at by Qhuloskians. The Imperial bombing run sent by Yurib almost killed them all but destroyed one of their speeders. When they reached Valance, Valance almost shot Solo. Valance then said to Solo that he couldn't believe that the Empire sent them to rescue him, but Solo said that they had chosen to rescue him. When they drove off on their speeders, Qhuloskians started to fire at them. Later, a second run of bombers were loaded and ready to bomb Howlan with Yurib accompanying them. Han, Valance, Nico, Tamu, and Lyttan were captured. Right before they were killed by the Qhuloskians, [[Ghular]]s opened fire on the aggressive aliens. The Ghulars were [[Slavery|slaves]] to the Qhuloskians to mine for [[farium]] to make the Qhuloskians' ships stronger during battle. Afterwards, the Ghulars escaped the planet by taking [[escape pod]]s from a crashed Qhuloskian warship. When they left, Nico began crying that [[Unidentified planet (Kanina Nico)|her home planet]] in the [[Huru system]] was under mining control and her friend [[Weegee]] was a [[miner]] there. She became very angry and kicked one of their bikes. Han then realized that one escape pod was left and decided to fake Nico's death. When Nico left, Han, Valance, Tamu, and Lyttan then left for the base, being chased and fired at by Qhuloskian ships. They then were destroyed by Yurib in the lead TIE, and Howlan was completely bombed and destroyed.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 5\" />\n\nLater, Solo had to say goodbye to Valance, Tamu, and Lyttan at the base, and Solo was put into the brig.<ref name=\"Imperial Cadet 5\" />\n\nAt some point his skills at flying at the Imperial academy at Carida became the only thing preventing his superiors from outright expelling him from the academy. Other recruits had tried to emulate his flying moves, but at least one recruit nearly died in a failed attempt. Broog vouched for Han to her commanding officer, Captain Nettic Whain, asking that he be given one more chance to fall into line. Finally, during an attack by raiders on Onyx Squadron, Han disobeyed orders once more in order to save the life of Cadet Lyttan Dree. Solo was able to take out three raiders before crashing into a hangar. Unfortunately, Solo's crash destroyed the hangar and dozens of astromechs. This action led to him being [[court-martial]]ed and [[Tribunal of Han Solo|tried]] by Commodore [[Almudin]].<ref name=\"Solo 1\" /> Solo was expelled from the academy,<ref name=\"Solo Expanded Edition\" /> drafted into the [[224th Imperial Armored Division]] as a [[Corporal]],<ref name=\"TOG\" /> and deployed to an active combat zone on Mimban.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n====The Mimban campaign and saving Chewbacca====\n{{Quote|I saved him, at least that's what he says, the big fuzzy fool, but really, he saved me.

Mimban was a world highly sought after by the [[Imperial Military|Imperial war machine]] due to its abundance of natural resources, leading the Empire to launch a full-scale invasion of the planet. The brutality of the battlefield shook the former cadet to his core, witnessing countless fellow soldiers senselessly die right before his eyes during the subjugation of a peaceful world. Solo's commanding officer, [[Major]] [[Staz]], was killed by an explosion during a desperate push into fortified enemy territory, leading the demoralized Solo to retreat and encounter [[Tobias Beckett]], [[Val]], and [[Rio Durant]], a gang of thieves who had disguised themselves as Imperial Army troopers to pull a heist.

Because the crew stole the coaxium fuel as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on [[Savareen]] in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called [[Maw Cluster|the Maw]], reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n====Savareen and choosing allegiances====\n{{Quote|You were wrong about one thing, I was paying attention.

The droid revealed the map to the lost treasure of Rane Mahal, which was located on [[Sakreen]]. As they headed to Sakreen, they were followed by Gwarm and his crew. Once they arrived at Sakreen, Solo spotted Rane Mahal's galleon, but Makkeer betrayed him and Chewie and broke the ''Millennium Falcon''. Makkeer also revealed that he had been working for Gwarm the entire time. The ''Millennium Falcon'' then crashed onto the surface. Gwarm and his crew then entered the galleon and found where the treasure was located. Solo and Chewie shot at them, and Chewie threw Makkeer at Gwarm and his gang. Solo then opened the chest and out came Rane Mahal. She revealed that there was no treasure and that she had been waiting for a ship to come so she could leave Sakreen. Solo suggested to Mahal that she take Gwarm's saucer. Mahal told her crew to load Solo, Chewie, Makkeer, Gwarm, and his gang aboard Gwarm's saucer and sell them to the first slave trader they came across. Solo and Chewie escaped. Mahal and her crew left Sakreen with Makkeer, Gwarm, and his gang. Mahal also took the droid that contained the location of Rane Mahal's fake treasure. She found out that Solo had put an ion scrambler on the droid, which caused the saucer to overload. The saucer was left in space.

They arrived and began negotiating. Solo assured Kenobi that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was the fastest ship around, because it had made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. Kenobi informed Solo that the cargo was only himself, Skywalker, two droids, and no questions asked beyond an admission that they wanted to avoid Imperials entirely. Therefore, Solo set the price at 10,000 credits&mdash;higher than he normally would have. However, Kenobi raised Solo's bid to 17,000 credits: 2,000 in advance and 15,000 when they reached Alderaan. His interest piqued at such a sum offered when it was so needed, Solo quickly accepted the deal. The smuggler then told his temporary employer to meet him in [[Docking Bay 94]] for departure as soon as he was ready, before warning Kenobi that some Imperial [[sandtrooper]]s had entered the cantina and were looking for Evazan and Baba's attacker.

Jabba was pleased and added that if Solo paid twenty percent interest all could be forgotten, but Solo talked him down to fifteen percent, and ironically stated that the Hutt was a \"wonderful Human being,\" before boarding the ''Falcon''.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nA short time later, Kenobi, Skywalker, and their two droids, the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], boarded the ''Falcon'' after Skywalker remarked that the ''Falcon'' appeared to be a \"piece of junk.\" Solo corrected him: The ''Millennium Falcon'' looked out of shape, but had been given \"special modifications\" that made it one of the fastest ships in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Just then, a [[Squadron|squad]] of stormtroopers appeared in the docking bay and opened fire on Solo. Solo fired back while retreating on board and shouted for Chewbacca to take off. The ''Falcon'' blasted away from the Mos Eisley spaceport and clear of Tatooine. As the ''Falcon'' entered space, Solo realized that his passengers were even more wanted by the Empire than he thought as multiple Star Destroyers pursued his ship.

Solo was skeptical of [[the Force]]&mdash;the energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy, and the Jedi, like Kenobi, were able to use to perform seemingly supernatural feats&mdash;because in all his travels he had never seen proof of its existence; to Solo, it was all \"simple tricks and nonsense.\" Kenobi took Solo's skepticism as a challenge and put a helmet over Luke's face so he couldn't see. Skywalker tried to deflect the bolts again, and did, while unable to see. Solo was mildly impressed, but attributed Skywalker's ability to luck.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Tractor_beam_falcon_death_star_recrop.jpg|thumb|right|253x253px|The ''Falcon'' is pulled into the Death Star by the station's tractor beams.]]\nSoon, the ''Falcon'' emerged from hyperspace in the Alderaan system. The ''Falcon'' came out at Alderaan's galactic coordinates, but into a [[meteor shower]], with Alderaan nowhere in sight. Kenobi, using the Force, realized the [[asteroid]] field was Alderaan: The entire planet had been destroyed by the Empire. Solo couldn't believe the Empire had had enough firepower to do so, even with their entire fleet, but then an Imperial short-range TIE fighter appeared, seemingly confirming Kenobi's suspicions. Skywalker and Solo both worried that if the fighter identified them as the freighter that had blasted away from Tatooine, they would be damned. Therefore, Solo got in range to destroy it. Kenobi, however, argued against it before Solo realized that the fighter did have a base&mdash;what appeared to be a small moon in the distance. Kenobi quickly surmised that the body was not a moon, but an Imperial [[space station]], the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] equipped with a [[superlaser]] capable of destroying entire planets. Solo was shocked at the Death Star's 120-[[kilometer]] spherical diameter and prepared to turn the ''Falcon'' around and retreat. One of the station's [[tractor beam]]s, however, began to pull the ''Falcon'' in. Solo prepared to fight his way out once they were taken aboard and shut the freighter down. Kenobi was able to talk Solo into listening to him, though: hide instead of fight. Therefore, they ejected the ''Falcon''{{'s}} five [[Model CEC Class-1]] [[escape pod]]s and hid themselves in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[smuggling compartment]]s located under the floor.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n====Rescuing the Princess of Alderaan====\n{{Quote|Wonderful girl! Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her!|Solo to Skywalker, after Organa took the lead in their escape|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nThe freighter was pulled into [[Docking Bay 327]] where it was boarded and quickly searched by stormtroopers on the orders of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> the Emperor's chief enforcer and a [[Dark Lord of the Sith]].<ref name=\"Vader Databank\">{{Databank|darth-vader|Darth Vader|archivedate=20200526063037}}</ref> After the troopers left, Solo and the others emerged from the compartments and Kenobi devised a plan to disable the tractor beam from inside the station. As they worked out the plan's details, an Imperial [[Sensor|scanning]] crew came aboard to more thoroughly search the ship. Solo shot them and then impersonated the crew, yelling out to a pair of stormtroopers outside for assistance. They came, Solo shot them, and he and Skywalker dressed themselves in [[Stormtrooper armor|their armor]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Han_luke_stormarmor.png|thumb|left|249x249px|Solo and Skywalker argue over whether to rescue the princess imprisoned aboard the Death Star.]]\nSkywalker, now under the guise trooper [[TK-421]], fooled an officer into opening the door to the hangar's [[Docking Control Room 327|control room]]. Chewbacca and Solo cut down the officer and his comrades, while Artoo plugged into a computer terminal to locate the tractor beam controls. Artoo found them and Kenobi departed to disable it after commanding the others to stay in the control room. Solo was fine with staying; he'd gotten much more than the he's signed on for in the cantina. Artoo, however, had learned that [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of Alderaan and a leading member of the Rebel Alliance, was aboard the station, and was scheduled to be executed in [[Detention Block AA-23]] very soon. Skywalker insisted that they go [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue her]], and reasoned that if Kenobi had known she was present, he would have gone after her, too. Solo at first refused, but decided it was worth the risk when Skywalker and Chewbacca assured him there would be a huge reward from the Rebel Alliance if she was rescued. Skywalker quickly worked out a subterfuge to bluff their way into the prison using Chewbacca as a prisoner scheduled for a prisoner transfer.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nSoon thereafter, they set out to the fifth level of the Death Star with their \"prisoner\" in [[stuncuffs]] and left the droids behind. They arrived at the detention level and told the officer in charge, [[Shann Childsen]], of the supposed transfer. He went to check the legitimacy of the fake stormtroopers' claim, while other troopers went to detain the Wookiee. Chewbacca, per the plan, attacked. Solo kept up the charade while firing on the guards and [[security camera]]s. Solo located the princess's cell in the prison computer and sent Skywalker to get her while he tried to convince an [[officer]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> [[Ensign]] [[Toos]],<ref name=\"End of Watch\">{{Shortstory|story=End of Watch|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> that nothing had gone wrong via a [[Comm unit|comm system]], before giving up and shooting the panel when the tech saw through the ruse and sent stormtroopers to investigate.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Into_the_garbage_chute_flyboy.jpg|thumb|right|249x249px|Organa takes command of her own rescue mission and orders Solo to jump into a garbage chute.]]\nThe troopers blockaded the only exit to the detention block and attacked. Solo and Chewbacca returned fire while they retreated to Skywalker's position. Skywalker had gotten the princess, who critiqued their plan to rescue her without thinking through an escape route. Solo quipped that she was welcome to return to her cell and be executed rather than rescued if she desired, while they took cover in the corridor and traded fire with the Imperials. Organa lost patience with the three men, took a blaster and shot open a chute and dove in after telling the others to follow. Solo remarked to Skywalker that he wasn't sure if he was very frustrated with Organa, or if he was beginning to like her, and shoved Chewbacca into the chute. Skywalker and Solo followed right after.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nThey found themselves in a [[Garbage masher 3263827|garbage compactor]] with the only exit locked. Solo sarcastically told Organa great work in getting them nowhere and tried to shoot the open the exit. The laser bounced wildly around the [[Garbage compactor|compactor]], nearly hitting the rebels. Skywalker informed Solo that he had already tried it, that it was [[Magnetic seal|magnetically sealed]]. Organa commanded Solo to put his blaster away. Solo was unhappy at being ordered around, but did so. Just then, a low growl sounded; the four simultaneously realized they weren't alone. A moment later, a tentacle belonging to [[Omi|a]] [[dianoga]] grabbed Skywalker and pulled him under water. Solo and Organa frantically searched for him, and seconds later he reemerged. Solo grabbed Skywalker and tried to shoot the creature, but Skywalker was pulled under again. Solo had almost given up looking when the dianoga released him and vanished. Solo helped him up, before the walls of the compactor began to close in. Chewbacca the princess and Solo tried to brace them while Skywalker contacted the droids in order for Artoo to hack into the station's network and shut down the compactor. After a bit of a delay, Artoo succeeded. The three Humans and the Wookiee rejoiced, for their lives had been saved.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Star_Wars_36_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|left|200px|Solo and Chewbacca flee from pursuing stormtroopers.]]\nThey left the compactor and Skywalker and Solo took off the trooper armor. As they did so, Chewbacca heard strange noises coming from the compactor and ran away. Solo fired a laser blast into the compactor to prove that the Wookiee was acting with cowardice. Organa scolded him for making so much noise, and told him that he would have to take orders from her if they were going to survive the ordeal. Solo was appalled at Organa's demeanor, and informed \"her worshipfulness\" that he only took orders from himself. Leaving Organa to quip that it was amazing that the smuggler was still alive. Solo looked at Skywalker and muttered that no reward was worth putting up with the princess's attitude.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nAs the group made their way back towards the docking bay, they ran into a group of stormtroopers. Solo yelled for Skywalker and Organa to go to the ''Falcon'' while he and his first mate charged the troopers. The troopers turned and ran from the screaming smuggler. Solo, however, ran into the troopers' reinforcements, and then he was being chased. He ran back into the hangar and through a [[blast door]] as it closed, stopping the troopers who had pursued him and Chewbacca. Solo caught up with Skywalker and Organa, who had also run into some trouble, and they prepared to board the ''Falcon'', but several stormtroopers stood guard outside. The troopers, however, rushed to Darth Vader, who was locked in [[lightsaber combat]] with Kenobi. The group took advantage of the distraction Kenobi had created to rush aboard the freighter&mdash;except for Skywalker, who stopped. Kenobi saw that Skywalker and the others would be safe, so he let himself be cut down by the Dark Lord. Skywalker yelled in grief, alerting the troopers to their presence. The troopers opened fire, but Solo ran and started his ship, and once everyone was on board, blasted off and away from the battle station. Their troubles were not over, however: four Imperial TIE fighters were in pursuit.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:InItForTheMoney-SWZ85.png|thumb|right|270px|Solo tells Organa that he's only in it for the money.]]\nChewbacca piloted the ''Falcon'' in order for Skywalker and Solo to man its turrets to fight off the attackers. A dogfight ensued, where Solo shot down one fighter and congratulated Skywalker when he shot one down, as well&mdash;and advised him to not \"get cocky.\" Solo soon shot down the final Imperial fighter and sighed in relief as they entered hyperspace to travel to [[Yavin 4]]&mdash;the location of the Rebels' [[Great Temple|hidden base]]. While en route to the [[Yavin system]], Organa grimly informed Solo that the Imperials had let them escape in order to track them to the hidden base, which explained the relative ease of their escape. Solo didn't believe it had been easy and demanded to know what information Artoo was carrying that made him so special. Organa told him: the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] to the Death Star. Solo was shocked, and added that once he was rewarded, he was going to leave; he claimed he wasn't interested in the Rebels' revolution or the princess as a companion. Organa assured Solo that if all he loved was money, that's all he would receive, and stomped away. Skywalker took her place and asked the smuggler what he thought of the princess. Solo admitted she had spirit, and inquired to whether Skywalker could see Organa and Solo together. Skywalker quickly said \"no,\" thereby admitting he had his own feeling for the princess&mdash;much to Solo's amusement.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n====A change of conscience====\n{{Quote|I knew you'd come back&mdash;I just knew it!''\"<br />\"''Well, I couldn't let you get all the credit and take all the reward!''\"<br />\"''Hey, I knew there was more to you than money!|Skywalker, Solo and Organa celebrate the destruction of the Death Star|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:Yavin_4_Temple.png|thumb|left|259x259px|Solo and his friends arrive at the Rebel base on Yavin 4.]]\nThe ''Falcon'' soon reached Yavin 4, where Solo and the others were welcomed; Alliance [[Alliance High Command]] had feared that Organa had died with her world. The plans within Artoo were analyzed and a weakness was discovered: a two-meter wide [[Thermal exhaust port|exhaust port]] that led to the station's main [[reactor]]. Solo and Chewbacca attended a briefing for the [[Rebel pilot]]s, including Skywalker, who were going to attack the station when it inevitably arrived. [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] explained that a one-man starfighter could get close enough and fire [[proton torpedo]]es into the shaft that would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the station. Solo was skeptical, thinking it [[suicide]] to even attempt. Therefore, after he was given his reward of credits, he packed up to leave, but was confronted by Skywalker who insisted he stay and fight with the Rebellion. Solo, thinking selfishly of his debt with Jabba, refused, and asked Skywalker to come with him and Chewbacca. Skywalker was dismayed with Solo's selfishness and angrily walked away. Solo called after him an old Jedi saying: \"[[May the Force be with you]].\" Chewbacca was disappointed in Solo&mdash;he wanted to stay and fight.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nSolo and Chewbacca then left Yavin 4 aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Soon, however, Chewbacca's nagging and Solo's conscience got the better of the smuggler, and he turned around and headed towards the Death Star, where the [[Battle of Yavin|battle]] was raging&mdash;although he did so not for the Rebellion's cause, but to save his friend, Skywalker.<ref name=\"Han Insider\">{{InsiderCite|158|Solo Journey}}</ref> He arrived in his ship to find Skywalker in his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] being pursued by three TIE fighters, led by Darth Vader, in the station's [[meridian trench]]. Solo fired on the three Imperial fighters, destroying one, and causing another to panic and collide with Vader, who was sent spinning away from the battle station. Solo yelled in glee and told Skywalker to fire his torpedoes, since he was now clear to do so. Skywalker did, and it was a direct hit: The Death Star blew apart<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and killed everyone on board.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref> Vader, however, escaped after regaining control of his fighter. Of the thirty Alliance ships that had participated in the battle, only three returned to the base with Solo in the ''Falcon''. Solo rushed to Skywalker as he exited [[Red Five (X-wing starfighter)|his fighter]] and congratulated him, while the princess embraced Solo for his bravery and proving there was more to him than money.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_honors_Han_and_Luke.jpg|thumb|right|234x234px|Organa awards Solo and Skywalker for their selflessness during the Battle of Yavin.]]\nA rushed<ref name=\"Ultimate\" /> [[Royal Award Ceremony|award ceremony]] was held later for the heroes of the battle, which included Solo. The three awardees, Solo, Skywalker and Chewbacca, walked the aisle past hundreds of Alliance personnel. They reached the stage, where Organa placed a [[Medal of Bravery|medal]] around Solo's neck as he winked at her. Skywalker was given his [[medal]] and they bowed to the princess and turned as the crowd clapped for them.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Organa delivered her speech, next.

Leia Organa, helping oversee the last stages of the evacuation, approached Han in an effort to get him to aid the Rebellion once more by rescuing Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]] of the elite rebel recon unit the [[Shrikes]]. Initially refusing, Han was eventually persuaded to come to the rebels' aid following pressure from his companion, Chewbacca. With an even larger bounty of 224,190 credits placed on his head,<ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\" /> Han decided against his better judgment to aid the princess, if only for feeling a pang of guilt for her and their doomed resistance movement. With the ''Falcon'' the fastest ship and only ship that could reach Ematt in time, Han and Chewie set course for the distant Outer Rim world of [[Cyrkon]], where Ematt had been last heard from. Narrowly escaping the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vehement]]'' by changing their ship's [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], the two landed in the city's capital, [[Motok]], where they ran into a [[Captivator's crew|gang]] of bounty hunters determined to claim the reward Jabba had put on their heads. Feigning surrender and stalling, Han offered to hand over the money they had to pay off their debts to Jabba for their lives. The arrival of ISB [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]] and a quartet of stormtroopers interrupted the firefight, whereupon Han pretended to be the victim of a gang of rowdy rebels. With the bounty hunters now engaged fighting the stormtroopers, Han and Chewie ran off to meet with their old friend [[Delia Leighton]] of the starship [[Serendipity|''Miss Fortune'']], a mobile bar that could pack up and leave whenever local authorities realized their operations and evasion of property taxes. While initially refusing to believe that Han was working with the Rebellion, Delia ultimately agreed to help Han by providing him with the location of Ematt in a low-rent [[hotel]] on the outskirts of town. Han and Chewie headed there in a recently purchased high-end speeder, for which Han intended to bill the Alliance. The gang of bounty hunters they had run into previously followed them after interrogating Delia and threatening to kill her longtime [[Curtis|friend]]. Unbeknownst to Han, Chewbacca and Ematt, the bounty hunters, realizing their situation for fighting the Empire earlier, agreed to help the Imperials by hunting down Han Solo and the rebel he was supposed to meet, with Alecia Beck having previously ambushed Ematt's team members of [[Taanab]]. Not intending to have Ematt commit suicide as his team members did to protect the sensitive information in their heads, Beck ordered over forty stormtroopers to take up positions in and around the hangar where the ''Falcon'' was berthed as the bounty hunters chased Han back towards his ship.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\n[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|right|250px|Commander Alecia Beck captures Han Solo and his crew.]]\nArriving in the hanger to be surrounded by stormtroopers, Han and his compatriots believed they were done for. Nonetheless, in an effort to escape, Han pretended to rile Chewie by referring to him as his slave, provoking an angry retort. Starting a fight, the rebels quickly assaulted the nearby Imperials attempting to cuff them as Delia and her ship, ''Miss Fortune'', opened fire on the hangar, with Delia seeking to make amends with Han for her forced betrayal. Firing at the two magnetic generators protecting the hangar from the toxic fumes of the planet outside, Han managed to escape with Chewie and Ematt along with Delia in her ship as they blasted off into the planet's atmosphere. Needing time for the navigation computer to plot their jump to lightspeed, Han and Chewie manned the cockpit while Ematt manned both [[turbolaser]]s from the ship's cockpit. Fending off several TIE fighters, the ''Miss Fortune'' suddenly took a hit to its navicomputer. After a moment's reflection, Han decided to help her and her ship instead of running away as he would have normally done, distracting the Star Destroyer as it utilized its tractor beam in an attempt to capture the ''Falcon''. Fixing their navicomputer, the ''Miss Fortune'' was able to jump to light speed but not before the ''Falcon'' was caught in the ''Vehement''{{'s}} lock. Han, horrified by the Empire's willingness to destroy its own fragile TIE fighters in the wake of their tractor beam to capture them, fell into a freefall towards the planet in an effort to escape the beam. Due to the planet's gravity interfering with the tractor beam, Commander Beck ordered the Star Destroyer to move closer to attain its target, but he was ultimately forced to pull out after realizing that utilizing the tractor beam so close to the capital city of Motok would destroy it, turning thousands of citizens against the Empire and resulting in mass media coverage of the atrocity. Backing off, the ''Falcon'' pulled up from its collision course with the city and jumped to the safety of hyperspace.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" />\n\n====Encountering Lady Proxima====\n{{Quote|You can't be talking about the Coaxium.

During this, [[Moloch]], who was a member of the White Worms, captured Solo and Chewbacca and brought them to Proxima. When Moloch brought Solo and Chewbacca into [[Den of the White Worms]], Proxima told him he would be punished because he owed her coaxium and gave her face scars from sunlight. Chewbacca gave Solo a thermal detonator, which he used to explode the window which brought in sunlight. The sunlight damaged Proxima's face again and blinded her right eye as Solo and Chewbacca made their escape.<ref name=\"Lady and the Tramp\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=17|story=[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 4: Lady and the Tramp]]}}</ref>\n\n====Secret mission and the Dragon Void Run====\nSolo and Chewbacca left to earn credits to pay off Jabba. They took several smuggling jobs, but Solo was getting nervous and turning down jobs. He was approached by [[Katrull]] with an easy job but turned it down, stating the sector was under Imperial observation. After Katrull left, Solo noticed [[Selentia|a female]] he had seen previously on another planet. Getting suspicious, he decided to leave only to be stopped by [[Adame|her partner]] at gunpoint. They escorted him back to the ''Falcon'', where Chewbacca greeted them. The two agents revealed themselves to be part of the Rebel Alliance. They explained that Princess Leia had sent them to borrow the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a special mission. Solo refused to allow his ship to used without him and returned to the Rebel fleet to confront the princess.<ref name=\"HS1\">[[Han Solo 1|''Han Solo'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Han_Solo_1_P11.jpg|thumb|right|233x233px|Han Solo meets with Princess Leia and General Cracken.]]When he arrived, he angrily asked Organa about her decision to use his ship without his permission or participation. She took him aside and led him to a meeting with [[Airen Cracken]]. Organa explained they had undercover agents they had to recover and decided to use the [[Dragon Void Run]] as cover to rescue them. She revealed that the Rebel leadership was worried about leaks and wanted to use a ship that wasn't aligned with the Rebel Alliance. Solo agreed to the mission and accompanied Organa back to the docking bay. There, they feigned an argument so it wouldn't draw suspicion when the ''Falcon'' and her crew left the fleet.<ref name=\"HS1\" />\n\nSolo and Chewbacca arrived in the [[Gomar sector]], checked in with the race officials and attended a party with the other racers. When the other participants realized he was a smuggler and not a professional racer, they first attempted to have him thrown out and then proceeded to ridicule him. [[Loo Re Anno]] intervened, and explained Solo had heart and the loyalty of his crew and this made him worthy. The racers then lined up and made the jump to hyperspace to travel to the first checkpoint in the race. When they arrived, Solo found his ship under attack along with the other racers.<ref name=\"HS1\" />\n\n[[File:Han_Solo_2_P10.jpg|thumb|left|241x241px|Han Solo realizes the key to winning this part of the race.]]Solo attempted to outmaneuver the attacking [[mine]]s, but was cut off by [[Delan Vook]]. Vook used the ''Falcon'' as a shield and fired on the attacking mines, hitting Solo's ship. Solo was angered by this and ran into Vook's ship, temporarily disabling it. As more of the mines attacked his ship, Solo noticed that they were ignoring the racers who had been knocked out. He correctly surmised that the mines were programmed to attack ships that were powered up, so he turned off his engines and coasted across the finish line unscathed. Loo Re Anno attached a cable to the ''Falcon'' and used it to tow her ship safely across the finish line as well. She thanked Solo for the assistance. After landing on [[Unidentified planet (Dragon Void Run)|the planet]], Solo confronted Vook about firing on his ship. Loo Re Anno told Vook that it was against the rules to fire on or tamper with another racer's ship and that he could be disqualified if Solo wanted to file a complaint. Solo declined, but warned Vook to stay out of his way. As Solo walked away, he was stopped by a [[Unidentified Dug smuggler|Dug smuggler]] who warned him that he was in danger. He was then stopped by several stormtroopers, who arrested him. Solo was rounded up with the other racers of the Dragon Void Run as observers of the race protested. Vook complained about the Imperial interference and was attacked by a stormtrooper. Solo came to his defense and was knocked to the ground. Before any more fighting could take place, an [[Tomine|Imperial officer]] stopped it so that there wouldn't be any bad publicity.<ref name=\"HS2\">[[Han Solo 2|''Han Solo'' 2]]</ref>\n\nTomine told Solo he and the other racers were criminals. When the Imperial officer took offense at [[Witness|Loo Re Anno's witnesses]], Solo stepped in to prevent the Imperials from harming them. The race officials convinced Tomine to let the race continue, and Solo ran back to his ship to start the next stage. Once on board, he found out that Chewbacca was injured while escorting the Rebel spy [[Bot (Duros)|Bot]] back to the ''Falcon''. They began the next stage of the race, and Bot explained his theory that one of the spies that Solo was tasked to pick up during the race was a murderer who was killing the other informants. Solo assured him that everything would be okay. The ship arrived at the next stage of the race, which was a grueling twelve-hour run through a shifting debris field. Solo considered purposely disqualifying himself, which would still allow him to visit all the planets in the race without the risk of the race. He changed his mind and decided to complete the stage despite the danger. At the very end, the ''Falcon'' clipped some debris which caused it to slow down and possibly be disqualified but was saved when Vook hooked a tow cable onto the ship and pulled it across the finish line. After landing, Solo left Chewbacca with the ''Falcon'' to go retrieve the second Rebel spy, but was followed by camera droids. One of Loo Re Anno's witnesses, who had attached itself to Solo, destroyed the camera droids so Solo could meet with the spy without being observed. Solo and the Rebel spy returned to the ''Falcon'', only to discover the spy had a history with Chewbacca and wanted to settle an old debt.<ref name=\"HS3\">[[Han Solo 3|''Han Solo'' 3]]</ref>\n\nOnce on the ''Falcon'', [[Dorae]] drew her blaster and explained that Chewbacca had killed her \"[[Dorae's rathtar|baby]],\" a newly hatched [[rathtar]] which was trying to kill Solo. She had planned to sell the creature, and its death had caused her serious financial problems. Solo stepped in front of her blaster in an attempt to defuse the situation. Loo Re Anno and the Twi'lek racers [[Sotna Reat]] and [[Nowk Asil]], who were alerted to the danger by one of Lee Re Anno's witnesses, boarded the ''Falcon'' to assist Solo. Solo told the racers he was handling the situation and didn't need their help. Asil confronted Solo and told him that the race shouldn't be used as cover for personal business. Lee Re Anno assured the Twi'lek that Solo wouldn't sully the race's reputation like that and then asked to speak to him privately. She described the history of the Dragon Void Run and how her [[Loo Re Anno's grandmother|grandmother]] had founded the race. She told Solo she saw something greater than just a simple pilot in him, but Solo replied that he was just a good pilot and being a special person just caused trouble. The racers left his ship, and Solo returned to the lounge where all his passengers were. Dorae questioned why Solo was working for the Rebel Alliance and told him she had joined after financial problems caused her to lose her [[Dorae's bar|bar]]. As the race was about to resume, Dorae told him that they were waiting for the last of the Rebel operatives, and once they were aboard he should abandon the race and return to the fleet. Solo decided to delay taking off to wait for the others. A speeder approached the ''Falcon'', chased by stormtroopers, and Solo told Chewbacca to start the engines in order to make a quick getaway. As the last of the Rebel spies boarded the freighter, Solo quickly left the planet, chased by TIE fighters. Solo wondered why they weren't trying to destroy the ship, and Dorae explained they were trying to capture them. Solo jumped to hyperspace and escaped. When they were safe, Solo joined the rest of the passengers. [[U'il]] explained that they were ambushed by the Empire because one of the Rebel spies in the group must be a traitor. She and Solo went into the cockpit and discussed their plan of action. U'Il wanted to return to the Rebel base, but Solo wanted to continue to the next leg of the race and try to determine who was giving information to the Empire. When they came out of hyperspace, he and the other racers were confronted by an Imperial fleet. U'Il suggested they flee, but Lee Re Anno convinced Solo and the other racers to continue the race.<ref name=\"Solo4\">[[Han Solo 4|''Han Solo'' 4]]</ref>\n\nSolo took evasive action and asked the other racers if they had any weapons on their ships. When they replied that they were unarmed, Chewbacca fired on a TIE fighter with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[quad laser cannon]]. During the fight, Dorae entered the cockpit and informed Solo that Aran had been murdered. Before he could react, Lee Re Anno summoned an [[interdimensional creature]] to distract the Imperials so the race could proceed. As the ''Falcon'' entered the Dragon Void, Solo went to confront his passengers. Dorae criticized his decision to enter the Void, knowing that they could end up stranded and captured by the Empire. Solo deduced that Bot had killed Aran, and was attacked by the Duros with a hidden [[poison]] injector. He headbutted Bot, who was subdued by Chewbacca but not before Bot injected himself with the poison. Solo and Chewbacca returned to the cockpit to finish the race. He contacted Loo Re Anno and asked her about her plans for after the race. She explained to him that her life as a lone pilot was coming to an end, and she would either win the race or perish. The race continued, and the starships approached the [[Dragon Void gate|gate]] that marked the end of the race. As they got closer, Solo managed to pilot the ''Falcon'' past [[Delan Vook's starship]] and the [[Starshot team]]. He drew even with [[Loo Re Anno's starship]] and passed her when her starship was hit by fire from the pursuing Imperials. When he got near the gate, he realized he was dooming the legendary pilot to death, and veered off at the last minute, which allowed Loo Re Anno to enter the gate first. His passengers were convinced they were going to be captured and killed by the Empire. U'Il suggested that Solo take her [[blaster]] and kill them all before the Empire could take them. The gate opened, and Loo Re Anno and the rest of her people emerged. She thanked Solo for allowing her to return to her people. She then reopened the gate, so the racers could return to the start of the race safely. Once clear of the Imperials, Solo returned to the Rebel base and delivered his passengers to Organa. She chided him on his rash behavior during the race. Solo reflected on the lesson he had learned from Loo Re Anno and decided to stay with the Rebels a while longer.<ref name=\"Solo5\">[[Han Solo 5|''Han Solo'' 5]]</ref>\n\n====Becoming one of the Empire's most wanted====\n{{Quote|You put your face in front of the Empire.

Solo decided to stick with the Alliance in order to [[Assault on Cymoon|destroy]] the Empire's largest [[weapons factory]] and use his connections to the Hutt Clan to bluff their way into the [[factory]], pretending to be the Hutt's envoy after Rebels ship-jacked the true envoy and stole their ship&mdash;which Solo, Organa, Skywalker, and Artoo traveled to Cymoon 1 in. Chewbacca and Threepio, likewise, piloted the ''Falcon'' to Cymoon 1, landing undetected in the extensive [[Cymoon 1 refuse fields|fields of refuse]] that surrounded the factory.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\nSolo landed the transport at Weapons Factory Alpha without incident and the group emerged from the craft. Organa and Skywalker were disguised in Jabba's [[bodyguard]] armor, acting as Solo's bodyguards, so Solo introduced himself to the Imperial delegation: the [[Overseer]] of the facility, [[Aggadeen]]&mdash;whom Solo quickly gave the derogatory nickname \"Aggie\"&mdash;a group of stormtroopers and a [[Unidentified LOM-series protocol droid|LOM-series protocol droid]]. After the protocol droid confirmed Solo's connections to the Hutts, \"Aggie\" led the false envoy onto the factory floor after Solo and the others handed over their weapons to the stormtroopers. Solo played along, cocky and overconfident, claiming to Aggadeen that he was the being that had taught Jabba his shrewd business skills. \"Aggie\" was unimpressed and chided Solo for his ignorance, and revealed that there were, in truth, not going to be any negotiations: The Empire would state their demands and Solo would accept them on behalf of the Hutt Clan without argument.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\nUpon arriving at the conference room where Solo was to meet the Empire's negotiator, Solo and Artoo began the attack; Artoo, Skywalker, and Organa took the stormtroopers down in [[hand-to-hand combat]], while Solo held the Overseer at gunpoint and demanded to know the direction to the facility's main power core. Aggadeen was horrified, but relented and sent them in the correct direction. While racing towards the core reactor, Organa contacted Threepio to ensure the droid would activate the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[autopilot]] in order to pick them up once they finished their task. Threepio assured them that he would, and that he would take care of Solo's ship.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\n[[File:To_the_main_power_core.png|thumb|left|242x242px|The Rebels make their way to the facility's main power core in order to blow it up.]]\nSolo, Organa, and Artoo then went to work rigging the core to explode. Skywalker, however, instead of standing guard as Solo had asked, fell into the Force and located several dozen slaves, which he freed. Solo grew worried at Skywalker's disappearance, but they finished [[Slicer|slicing]] into the reactor nonetheless, programming it to self-destruct in ten minutes. Organa took time to thank Solo for defying his selfish nature to aid her and the Rebellion; however, she questioned just why Solo would act so, wishing to know his true motives. Solo's motives were to help his new friend, Skywalker, but he was saved from admitting that he was also interested in Organa romantically when Skywalker returned to the reactor room with the slaves. Solo figured \"the more the merrier\" and called Threepio to tell him to start the ''Falcon''{{'s}} autopilot and pick them up. Chewbacca interrupted, bringing news of the arrival of the Empire's negotiator: Darth Vader. Solo ordered the Wookiee to retreat from the Dark Lord, but Organa countered Solo, telling Chewbacca to open fire in order to rid the galaxy of Vader.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\nChewbacca consented, but was unable to defeat Vader and was forced to flee, falling out of contact with Solo's group. Solo called Threepio, inquiring where he and the ''Falcon'' were, regretting that the planned chain of events had gone awry. The protocol droid explained that he had not yet arrived because the freighter was being dismantled by [[Unidentified Cymoon 1 species|native scavengers]]. Solo told him to solve the problem and took off with Organa, Skywalker, Artoo, and the slaves in search of a way out of the factory. Solo located a hangar full of massive [[All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]]s and proceeded<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /> to hijack one such behemoth.<ref name=\"Star Wars 2\">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref> Unbeknownst to the group, Skywalker had left the group in order to find and face Darth Vader, the man he believed had killed his Jedi father.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Leia_steal_AT-AT.jpg|thumb|right|281x281px|Han and Leia stole an AT-AT.]]\nSolo, Organa, Artoo, and several slaves boarded the walker, so Solo began their escape, barreling through the walls of the facility. Solo located Skywalker and Vader locked in lightsaber combat, so he brought the leg of the AT-AT into the confrontation, which forced the two combatants apart. The smuggler told Skywalker to follow him with the slaves, as he was going to clear a path out of the factory before it exploded. Organa saw Vader and ordered Solo to target him, while the slaves targeted the Imperial ground troops. As a consequence of the walker being just-made, the laser cannons were not yet operational, which kept Artoo and a pair of [[Jawa]]s busy while they worked on enabling them while Solo and Organa argued.<ref name=\"Star Wars 2\" />\n\nWhile the rebels continued in their escape, Solo brought the walker towards Vader, trying to crush him with the AT-AT's feet. However, Vader used the [[dark side of the Force]] to stop the walker. The dark power the Sith Lord wielded began to tear the behemoth apart. Solo was in disbelief at Vader's power&mdash;Solo was still not convinced that the power Skywalker and Vader wielded was real&mdash;and at Artoo's assurance that they were operational, opened fire on Vader with the walker's laser cannons, minorly injuring the Dark Lord and allowing Solo to pilot the walker outside the facility into the refuse fields. In the moment of calm, Solo tried to contact both Chewbacca and Threepio, but both failed to answer, leaving Solo to be very grateful when Skywalker assured him that he was heading towards the rendezvous.<ref name=\"Star Wars 2\" />\n\nWhile continuing their journey towards the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca roared over the comlink, relieving Solo that his friend was alive. Chewbacca then rescued Threepio from the tentacles of the scavengers and began to repair the damage they had done in order to pick up Solo and the others. However, Organa and Solo soon realized that the factory's reactor must have been defused, because it had been long past ten minutes and it hadn't exploded. Just after, Darth Vader set himself upon stopping the stolen walker, which he did by cutting down the walker's legs. Solo and Organa looked at each other in realization as Vader succeeded in his task: the walker crashed to the ground. Solo was injured in the crash and left battered and [[blood]]y. Organa and the slaves carried him from the wreckage while Skywalker covered them. The Jedi-to-be then returned to the factory mounted on a 74-Z speeder bike and destroyed the core reactor, decimating the entire facility. Chewbacca, with the ''Falcon'' repaired enough to fly, picked up the rebels, and they fled into hyperspace<ref name=\"Star Wars 3\">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref> to the safety of the Rebel fleet.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" />\n\nAboard one of the Rebel [[capital ship]]s, Solo was treated for the injuries he sustained. He and Chewbacca then repaired the ''Falcon''<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" /> best they could with the parts they were allowed by the Alliance deck crew.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" /> Later, Solo advised Skywalker, who was leaving on a journey to return to Tatooine to continue his Jedi journey, to not leave because it was too dangerous. Skywalker left anyway, though, believing it something he needed to do.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" />\n\n====Return of the spouse and rescuing Skywalker====\n{{Quote|Enough of this, Sana.

Organa chided him, explaining that the Rebellion couldn't afford to give away expensive items for free&mdash;Solo had to work for them. The princess informed the smuggler that she was going on a [[scout]]ing mission to a possible location for a new Rebel base; Solo could act as her pilot on the mission and receive the parts he needed as payment. Solo agreed, though he was adamant that he would leave the Rebellion upon their return.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" />\n\nSolo and Organa soon set off aboard a stolen Imperial [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]], the ''[[Invictus]]'', and intended to scout several locales, including the [[Ganath Cloud]] and the [[Moons of Ovise]]. They began their search in the [[Moddell sector]]. Before they could truly begin, however, a pair of Imperial TIE fighters unexpectedly approached the shuttle and demanded identification from the ''Invictus''. Solo found it inexplicable that Imperials were as far out in the Outer Rim as they were, and prepared to put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers. The princess stopped him, however, and transferred their stolen clearance codes to the [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]]. The pilots were about to clear the ''Invictus'', but Solo became impatient and put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers, tipping the Imperials off that the ''Invictus'' was not what it claimed to be, so the Imperials opened fire. Organa was furious at Solo, but as it was too late to rectify the situation, let Solo take the shuttle to an unnamed planet in the nearby Monsua Nebula. The TIEs didn't follow Solo through the planet's electrical super-storms, though that saving grace didn't change the princess's mind; she told the smuggler that she hated him.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" />\n\n[[File:Han_loses_his_nerve.jpg|thumb|right|295x295px|Solo loses his nerve at the arrival of Sana Starros, who claimed to be his wife.]]\nOn the surface of the planet, Solo was satisfied when Organa forgot their troubles, admitting that she found it incredible that beneath the planet's atmosphere of super-storms, a beautiful oasis laid. Solo led her to his secret hiding place and offered her a glass of Corellian [[wine]] in an attempt to seduce her. The princess rejected Solo's invitation: she threw the wine into his face, stormed out of the cave, and berated him for getting side-tracked on their mission&mdash;especially when they were in danger. Organa argued that if Solo hadn't lost his nerve and alerted the TIEs that they weren't who they claimed to be, they wouldn't have been in the predicament in the first place. Solo countered that nothing in the entire galaxy could make him lose his nerve. However, a ship&mdash;the ''[[Volt Cobra]]'', Sana Starros' ship&mdash;appeared and fired a laser blast down at the pair. Solo recognized the ''Cobra'', lost his nerve, and told Organa to run. Confounded, Solo and Organa watched as Starros emerged from her freighter and introduced herself to the princess, pointing a blaster at her and claiming to be Sana Solo, Han's wife. Solo could only put his hand on his face and mutter \"oh no.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n\nStarros had placed probes in the atmosphere of the planet some time before<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" /> in an attempt to track Solo, and it had paid off. Starros had taken it upon herself to make Solo's life miserable until he paid her share from the robbery on Stenness years earlier.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" /> Organa was shocked that Solo had never told her he was married, though Solo made it clear that he wasn't. Starros greeted Solo with a kiss, and then struck him across the face, which led Organa to decide that she wanted no part of their business. Solo called to the princess, pleading to her that Starros was not his wife. And when he did, Starros recognized the name of Princess Leia and decided to claim the bounty on Organa by turning her in to the Empire. Organa ignored them and went to return to the ''Invictus'', but Starros, by voice-control, told the ''Cobra'' to destroy the shuttle, which it did, cutting of their escape. Solo was appalled at Starros' ruthlessness and was forced to let Starros frisk him; she took his DL-44 blaster pistol.<ref name=\"Star Wars 8\">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Starros_Solo_Organa.jpg|thumb|left|272x272px|Solo attempts to defuse the tension between Starros and Organa in the Monsua Nebula]]\nStarros then contacted the Star Destroyer that had come to the planet after being alerted by the TIE that had originally pursued the ''Invictus'', telling them that she intended to claim the bounty on Organa. Solo whispered to Organa that he could make it right, though he wouldn't take Starros on in a gunfight: she was a better shot than him. The princess, however, took over Solo's plan; she kicked him into Starros and pulled a blaster pistol from her boot. Much to Solo's dismay, Organa held Starros and him at gunpoint, though Starros pointed out the flaw in Organa's plan: TIE fighters were already descending from the sky.<ref name=\"Star Wars 8\" />\n\nSeveral TIEs landed and their pilots emerged, ordering the trio to stand down. Organa [[Escape from the Monsua Nebula|opened fire]] on them. Solo pleaded with Starros to give him back his blaster, but she refused, only consenting when Solo lost his temper and admitted that he had joined the Rebel Alliance and was on the Empire's most wanted list. Solo and Starros raced aboard the ''Volt Cobra'', and Organa did, too, after realizing that Starros had given up on selling her to the Empire. Solo tried to persuade Starros to let him pilot her ship, but both she and Organa commanded him to \"shut up\" as they fled into space.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> Solo and Organa manned the ''Cobra''{{'s}} turbolasers, firing on the pursuing TIEs before Starros finally jumped to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>\n\nWhile in hyperspace, Starros mused Solo, amused that he had become a Rebel. Solo berated Starros for continuing to claim to be his wife, reminding her that their marriage was illegitimate and part of a robbery they had both been a part of. Organa then interrupted, bringing news from the Rebel fleet that Skywalker was in trouble on the Hutt world of [[Nar Shaddaa]], the \"smuggler's moon.\" Solo did not understand what his friend was doing there, but he would soon find out: Organa promised to pay Starros if she took them to Nar Shaddaa&mdash;and Starros accepted.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" /> En route to Nar Shaddaa, Solo begged Organa to trust him rather than Starros, but Organa mostly ignored him and slammed a door in his face. Flustered, Solo decided to admit the truth&mdash;he explained the robbery on Stenness, where he had participated in a marriage ceremony with Starros that was faked. He went to apologize to her, but behind the door, Organa was gone. Solo slumped to the floor, wishing Chewbacca was with him.<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\" />\n\n[[File:Solo_shot_Dengar.jpg|thumb|right|245x245px|Solo and Organa stand over Dengar after shooting him in the back.]]\nShortly thereafter, the ''Cobra'' arrived on Nar Shaddaa at the coordinates of Chewbacca and Threepio, who had also answered Skywalker's distress call and come to his rescue. Chewbacca, however, had fallen afoul with the Corellian bounty hunter [[Dengar]], who had subdued the Wookiee in an attempt to lure Solo there so he could claim Jabba's bounty on Solo.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" /> Enraged, Solo shot the bounty hunter in the back and demanded he take his \"damn hands off\" his friend.<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\" /> Solo ordered Dengar to step away from Chewbacca and he would be allowed to live, but Dengar refused; instead he activated a [[thermal detonator]] that he threatened to detonate. Chewbacca, who was not hurt badly, took advantage of Dengar when he was distracted and threw the bounty hunter from the roof of the [[skyscraper]], where the [[grenade]] and Dengar exploded. With that settled, Solo made sure Chewbacca was all right. The group did not know where Skywalker was, but a flight of TIE fighters streaking through the sky tipped them off: follow trouble to find Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" /> Immediately after, Solo and the group&mdash;including Starros, who had come to ensure Solo did not try to lose her&mdash;arrived at the location of the Imperial attention: the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt]], where Skywalker had been kidnapped<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" /> by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt,<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" /> an avid collector of all things Jedi. Grakkus had organized a [[gladiator]] fight between Skywalker and [[Kongo|Kongo the Disembowler]], a massive beast from the [[Volcano|molten]] world of [[Mustafar]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" /> As Solo led the group into the palace, the crowd that had come to watch the fight fled the arena because Kongo was on the loose. Solo and the others tried to fire on the monster, but an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP blast]] triggered by Grakkus had disabled all electronics&mdash;including blasters. Confounded on how to proceed, the group was saved by Artoo, who located the group and threw Solo, Chewbacca, and Organa each lightsabers that belonged to Grakkus. Solo scoffed at using the weapon of [[Force-sensitive]]s, but with his DL-44 unusable, he charged into the [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|melee]] with his first mate and the princess, cutting down stormtroopers and TIE pilots.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" />\n\n[[File:Lightsaber_battle_in_the_arena.png|thumb|left|272x272px|Solo wields a lightsaber for the first time in Grakkus's arena while rescuing Skywalker.]]\nSolo soon located Skywalker and went to gather him so they could leave the smuggler's moon. Skywalker quipped that Solo looked good wielding the Jedi weapon, though Solo only wished he had his blaster at his side. Skywalker tried to persuade Solo to let him go back and claim more of Grakkus's Jedi artifacts, but Chewbacca hoisted the Jedi-in-training and carried him back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo made sure Organa and Starros also made it out.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" /> Starros made her peace with Organa and Solo, so she set off on her own in the ''Cobra''.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" /> Skywalker, using \"[[The Journals of Ben Kenobi]]\" that he had claimed on Tatooine,<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" /> set out to the planet [[Vrogas Vas]], where an ancient [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi temple]] was said to remain.

Organa informed Solo that she intended to go after Vader to kill him, though Solo thought it foolish; Vader was too powerful. Solo realized, however, that Vrogas Vas was where Skywalker had gone, so he decided to put priority on making sure Skywalker was all right&mdash;not wishing to face Vader as the princess wanted. Soon thereafter, Solo, Chewbacca, Threepio, and Organa traveled to Vrogas Vas aboard the ''Falcon'' with a complement of Rebel starfighters.<ref name=\"Vader Down 1\" />\n\nThe YT-1300 freighter soon arrived at the [[Rebel Refueling Base]] on Vrogas Vas, and he and the princess were briefed in the mission by an Alliance [[Unidentified Rebel captain|captain]]: Skywalker had brought Vader down by crashing his T-65 X-wing into Vader's TIE Advanced, the bravest thing the [[captain]] had ever seen. After receiving word that Skywalker's safety status was unknown, just that his fighter had crashed, Solo took it upon himself to rescue the \"lucky, crazy kid.\" Solo expected Organa to do the same, but she put her focus on taking Vader down once and for all. Solo was shocked that the princess would do that, but he left her to lead an assault on Vader with the base's [[company]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 13\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref> Solo nonetheless left with Chewbacca in the ''Falcon'' and headed to the quadrant where Skywalker crashed, saddened at Organa's order of priories.<ref name=\"Star Wars 13\">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref>\n\nUpon arriving at the coordinate's where Skywalker crashed, Solo and Chewbacca saw explosions in the distance, so they quietly landed the ''Falcon'' near the source of the commotion. Solo hiked atop a ridge with a [[sniper rifle]], while Chewbacca headed around the ridge to intercept the mercenaries. Solo soon saw Skywalker, though he was unconscious and being carried by the [[assassin droid]] [[0-0-0]]. 0-0-0 was accompanied by his counterpart, the [[BT-1 assassin droid]] [[BT-1]], and their master, [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], who had been hired by Vader to kidnap Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars 13\" />\n\n[[File:Aphra_and_Han_and_waspworms.jpg|thumb|left|257x257px|Solo and Aphra, about to collide while covered with wasp-worms on Vrogas Vas]]\nSolo called out to Aphra and her droids, making it clear that he wanted to just save his friend.<ref name=\"Star Wars 13\" /> Aphra, however, had researched Skywalker's associates<ref name=\"Darth Vader 13\" /> and recognized Solo, so she thought she could anticipate his next moves. Aphra retorted to him that he would have shot first if he was any good at rescuing his friends. Solo recognized Aphra as the notorious gun thief, and listened to her threats, waiting for Chewbacca to get in position. Once the Wookiee was in position, he ripped off 0-0-0's&mdash;known commonly as Triple-Zero&mdash;arms before the droid could harm Skywalker. Aphra charged and took cover at the bottom of the ridge below Solo, and they fired on one another while Chewbacca took on the assassin droids. Skywalker was awakened by Artoo in the ensuing chaos and forced to flee when BT-1&mdash;known commonly as Beetee&mdash;charged after them. With neither Solo nor Aphra able to gain the upper hand, they each resorted to shooting their own nests of [[wasp-worm]]s above each other's heads, which dropped the stinging worms onto each other. Blinded and covered in worms, Solo tried to rip them off of himself, but ended up colliding head-on with Aphra. Skywalker, with Chewbacca and Artoo, came and revived the smuggler and thanked him for coming to his rescue again. Triple-Zero and Beetee, however, confronted the Rebels, intending to kill them, which Artoo denied them when he sprayed a liquid into Beetee's [[Missile launcher|rocket launchers]] and chainguns, which caused the confused droid to launch his weaponry, blowing up the ridge around them.<ref name=\"Star Wars 13\" /> Solo and the group fled the chaos back towards the ''Falcon'', and Solo called Threepio to tell him to inform the princess that they had rescued Skywalker, no thanks to her.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 14\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>\n\nOnce at the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca explained that Triple-Zero had poisoned him with [[Mandalorian Xenetox]]. Artoo prepared to give him a medical shot that would reduce the effects of the Mandalorian Xenetox. Just then, a live message from Organa came over the ''Falcon''{{'s}} comm system, in which Organa ordered a squadron of Y-wing bombers to converge on her position and drop their payload on her because she had been captured by Vader, and in her death, Vader would also be killed. Solo quickly got his ship in the air and stubbornly told the princess over the comm that he was not going to let her sacrifice herself.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 14\" />\n\n[[File:Krrantan_takes_the_blaster_of_Han.jpg|thumb|right|305x305px|Krrsantan takes Solo's DL-44 pistol.]]\nHowever, before they could make any headway, an [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|Auzituck anti-slaver gunship]] collided head-on with the ''Falcon'', knocking both starships into the ground below. Solo and Skywalker recovered themselves, and were met with the imposing figure of the Wookiee [[Black Krrsantan]],<ref name=\"Darth Vader 14\" /> a bounty hunter working for Jabba, second only to Boba Fett..<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" /> Solo pleaded with Krrsantan that it wasn't the time to collect Jabba's bounty on him. Unknown to Solo, however, Krrsantan was working alongside Doctor Aphra and had come to claim Skywalker to take to Aphra. Krrsantan blew a hole in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} cockpit using a [[Detonator/Legends|detonator]] and pulled Skywalker out. Solo was at first glad he hadn't come on Jabba's behalf, but then he realized that him taking Skywalker was no better. A duel between Wookiees then broke out when Chewbacca came to Skywalker's defense. Solo told Skywalker to run and save Organa while Solo and Chewbacca took care of Krrsantan to insure they had a ship to escape Vrogas Vas in.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 14\" />\n\nNeither Wookiee gained the upper hand for some time, so Solo drew his DL-44 pistol to help his friend, but Krrsantan thwarted his attempt when he threw Chewbacca straight into the smuggler, knocking his blaster into the bounty hunter's grasp. Artoo emerged from the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he hadn't gotten a chance to give Chewbacca the shot to reverse the poison, so he sent a syringe flying into Chewbacca. Rejuvenated, Chewbacca quickly gained the upper hand against Krrsantan. Solo contacted Skywalker via comlink and asked whether he had located Organa yet, to which Skywalker replied with a warning, just as he was knocked unconscious by Imperial stormtroopers and captured. Before Solo could warn Artoo of Skywalker's capture, Krrsantan, who had overpowered Chewbacca using a dishonorable tactic, grabbed Solo around the neck and began choking him.<ref name=\"Star Wars 14\">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref> Threepio, of all beings, confronted Krrsantan, urging him to release Solo and cease hostilities.

However, Threepio had lost both his arms to Triple-Zero, and when Krrsantan struck him, loose wiring protruding from the droid shocked the Wookiee and knocked him out.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 15\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Escaping_Vrogas_Vas.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|Solo pilots his ship with his friends in escape of Vader and Vrogas Vas.]]\nShortly thereafter, Solo and Artoo revived Threepio and informed him that he had, against all odds, \"saved the day.\" Chewbacca also came to and pointed to an Imperial ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle that was flying towards space. Solo had a bad feeling that Skywalker was aboard, and was overcome with guilt at realizing that he had let his friend get captured. Remarkably, the shuttle's engines blew, and it crashed back to the ground. Solo and the others rushed towards the crash site and brought the Rebel pilot back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo mused that Skywalker must have had a guardian angel, but Skywalker assured him as per usual, that the Force was with him&mdash;though Solo, as per usual, didn't believe it. Upon returning to his ship, Solo noticed that Krrsantan was nowhere to be seen, and that the hole that the bounty hunter had blown into the ''Falcon''{{'s}} cockpit had curiously been patched up. In answer to Solo's wondering, Aphra appeared and informed the rebels that they were standing in a field of [[Micromine|micro-mines]], and she had her finger on the trigger to detonate the mines. With little choice, Solo dropped his blaster and listened to Aphra contact Vader via comlink that she had Skywalker, Solo, and the others at her mercy. The rebels were shocked that Aphra had actually thrown in with the Sith Lord and was working for him. Before Vader could arrive, however, Organa finally made it back, having escaped Vader herself due to the timely arrival<ref name=\"Darth Vader 15\" /> of one of Vader's rivals, the [[Mon Calamari]] General [[Karbin]],<ref name=\"Star Wars 14\" /> and struck Aphra across the jaw, thereby also saving the day. Solo was very pleased to have Organa back with them, and they carried Aphra's unconscious body aboard the ''Falcon'' and they together escaped Vader and Vrogas Vas.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 15\" />\n\n====Smuggler, rebel, mentor, hostage====\n{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''\"<br />\"''Heh, don't worry, kid.

On the other hand, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion in the meantime.<ref name=\"Star Wars 16\">[[Star Wars (2015) 16|''Star Wars'' (2015) 16]]</ref>\n\n[[File:HanLukeCheatsAtSabacc-StarWars16.jpg|thumb|right|267x267px|The rebel smugglers flee for their lives after Solo was caught cheating at sabacc.]]\nThe rebel duo traveled back to [[Unidentified spaceport (Han Solo)|a spaceport]] of a [[Unidentified planet (sabacc)|planet]], as Solo had decided to try and double the Rebellion's credits by cheating his way through a game of sabacc against a green-skinned [[Unidentified Dowutin|Dowutin]]&mdash;and in doing so, he hoped to make enough credits to begin to pay restitution to Jabba. Part way through the game, due to the large amounts of credits Solo was betting in overconfidence, the [[Dowutin]] began to suspect Solo of cheating. The smuggler lied, insisting that he was not, and reassured Skywalker's misgivings in Solo possibly losing the Alliance's money. A very short time later, the Dowutin and his cronies discovered that Solo was, in fact, playing a dishonest game, so Solo fled with Skywalker just behind&mdash;not wanting to discover if the Dowutin really was going to cut off their fingers and tongues for their dishonesty. The rebel duo boarded the ''Falcon''&mdash;which they had taken on their journey&mdash;and blasted away from the planet. Skywalker, angry with Solo's recklessness with credits that weren't theirs, voiced that they could get kicked out of the Rebellion for losing several thousand Rebel-owned credits. At Solo's retort that he needed to get the price off his head as soon as possible, Skywalker revealed that he, too, had an Imperial bounty of 60,000 credits on his head. Solo was distraught&mdash;Solo's bounty<ref name=\"Star Wars 16\" /> was a mere 50,000 credits.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /> Solo intended to make back the rebels' credits and more the best way he knew how with Skywalker at his side: smuggling contraband.<ref name=\"Star Wars 16\" />\n\nWith his new first mate, Solo traveled to Nar Shaddaa aboard the ''Falcon''. However, due to Solo being banned for cheating at sabacc at [[Unidentified criminal establishment (Nar Shaddaa)|the establishment]] where he intended to obtain something to smuggle&mdash;and Solo wanted to work on repairing his ship's ailing hyperdrive, let alone teach Skywalker the skills of a galactic smuggler&mdash;he sent the Jedi-in-training in his stead. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker returned to Solo and the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he had acquired a job from a [[Unidentified Twi'lek (Nar Shaddaa)|blue-skinned Twi'lek]]&mdash;though at only 5,000 credits, it was half the credits Solo had hoped for. Solo had expected an easy shipment, but he got more than he bargained for when the cargo was revealed to be a herd of large, pungent [[nerf]]s&mdash;so many, in fact, that they filled up Solo's prized ship all the way into the cockpit, crowding the two rebels as they piloted the freighter towards their destination: the backwater planet [[Ibaar]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 17\">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref>\n\n[[File:You_got_a_lot_of_nerfs.jpg|thumb|left|234x234px|Solo berates Skywalker while piloting his ship under a herd of nerfs.]]\nEn route to Ibaar, the nerfs shed lots of [[Hair|fur]] and made \"messes\" around Solo's ship. Solo told Skywalker that for only managing half the credits they needed, and for the unruly cargo of nerfs, that Skywalker was \"dead\" to him. A minute later, a trio of Imperial TIE fighters appeared and ordered the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew to halt and allow the Imperials to board the ship because they believed the Corellian YT-1300 light freighter to be transporting illegal livestock that was on its way to an Imperial world that the Empire believed to be sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Infuriated, Solo refused, but with their hyperdrive out of commission, Solo worked his way through the situation&mdash;all the while urging Skywalker to control the un-space-worthy nerfs.<ref name=\"Star Wars 17\" />\n\nSkywalker then shot down the three pursuing Imperial fighters, allowing Solo to land safely on the mountainous Ibaar, where the herd of livestock was unloaded by a pair of [[nerf herder]]s. While the shepherds did their work, Skywalker begged Solo to allow him to pilot the ''Falcon'' as a sort of right of passage for Solo's idea to make the Jedi farm boy into a smuggler. Solo refused and retorted that Skywalker had proven himself to be a poor smuggler by failing to make a profit on their cargo job to Ibaar, and told him that he was going to have to thoroughly clean the ''Falcon'' or Chewbacca would be angry with them both. But Skywalker threatened to inform Princess Organa that Solo had gambled with the Alliance's credits, and Solo begrudgingly let Skywalker fly his ship. While doing so, Skywalker quipped that he felt the ''Falcon'' was sluggish, which offended Solo, and he quickly took the controls back from Skywalker. After receiving a distress message from Sana Starros, Solo and Skywalker rushed to Sunspot Prison in order to rendezvous with Organa and Starros there.<ref name=\"Star Wars 18\">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Eneb_Ray_holds_rebels_hostage_on_Sunspot_Prison.jpg|thumb|right|263x263px|Eneb Ray threatens to kill Solo and Skywalker if Organa doesn't agree to his demands.]]\nUpon arriving at the prison space station,<ref name=\"Star Wars 18\" /> however, [[Eneb Ray]], former Rebel spy and insurgent, covertly knocked the Solo and Skywalker out, tied them to the ''Falcon''{{'s}} landing gear, placed [[bandolier]]s of thermal detonators around their necks and used them as hostages while he revealed his identity to Organa, Starros, and Aphra&mdash;who had made a temporary truce with the two other women in order to repel the [[Assault on Sunspot Prison|attack]] by [[Eneb Ray's forces|Ray's forces]]. Shortly thereafter, Organa, Starros, and Doctor Aphra&mdash;who had come to a temporary truce with the other women in order to repel Ray's attack&mdash;arrested Ray after disorienting him by disabling the prison's [[artificial gravity]], which also awoke Solo and Skywalker. The two rebels were then freed and a portion of the Alliance fleet arrived and began the evacuation of Sunspot Prison. The smuggler then made sure Skywalker wouldn't tell Organa of his mishap with the Alliance's funds, and the rebels abandoned the space-bound prison.<ref name=\"Star Wars 19\">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>\n\n====The ''Harbinger''====\nLater, Han Solo assisted the Rebellion in stealing the Imperial Star Destroyer [[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|''Harbinger'']] as part of a mission to [[Siege on Tureen VII|assist]] the people of [[Tureen VII]]. During the operation, he raced Leia Organa to decide who would be the captain of the stolen ship. As they raced, [[Task Force 99]] infiltrated the ''Harbinger''.

Sol told her that the ''Ark Angel''{{'s}} aft thruster was misaligned. He was then confronted by [[Varroa]] and several of the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen's]] guards. Solo and the others then hid behind a door. Inside the door were [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. Solo attempted to confront the Queen but was hypnotized.<ref name=\"Screaming Citadel 3\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>\n\nSolo was taken to the queen's chamber, where one of the symbiotes stung him in the neck. He was then forced to drink something that forced him to serve the queen. Solo was given armor and forced to track down Leia and Starros. Solo and the guards cornered Leia. He attempted to use a symbiote on her but was stopped when Starros and Aphra's droids arrived.<ref name=\"Screaming Citadel 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref> Solo attempted to shoot Leia and Starros, but Leia was able to convince him and the guards to lower their weapons.

Solo was named King by the guards, but did not want to tell people what to do. He was able to disband the hive and free the people. Solo was then sedated by Triple-Zero.

En route to Akiva, Solo threatened to shoot Grakkus if he tried anything against him or Chewie. Grakkus tried to convince Solo to free him and return to his life as smuggler. As Solo thought about Grakkus' offer,<ref name=\"Hutt Run\">[[Star Wars (2015) 35|''Star Wars'' (2015) 35]]</ref> the ''Falcon'' came under attack by three TIEs.<ref name=\"13 crates\">[[Star Wars (2015) 34|''Star Wars'' (2015) 34]]</ref>\n\nSolo realized that Grakkus had disabled the hyperdrive. Solo attempted to evade the TIE patrol to no avail. He decided to contact the TIEs and surrender to them. Solo landed the ''Falcon'' on a asteroid where the three TIE pilots boarded the ship and met Grakkus. After Grakkus killed on of the pilots, Sol finished off the last two after hiding in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} secret compartments. Solo turned Grakkus' offer and decided to resume his voyage to Akiva. Upon hearing this, Grakkus grabbed Solo by the neck and demanded that Chewie take him to [[Teth]], where his [[Grakkus' safe house|safe house]] was. Upon confirming it, Solo shocked Grakkus and sent the information to General Draven. Solo told Grakkus that it was all a setup to get his safe house's location. After X-wings arrived, Solo knocked Grakkus out and took him to prison.<ref name=\"Hutt Run\" />\n\n====Trouble on Odona====\n[[File:UnidentifiedcreatureOdona.jpg|thumb|left|205x205px|A creature attacks Han and Leia.]]\nSolo took Leia to Odona to see if it was a viable location for a new rebel base. However, they got lost in a series of caves for three days and were attacked by a [[Unidentified creature (Odona)|creature]]. Unbeknownst to Solo or Leia, they were tracked and followed by Frax, [[Selt]], and a droid. Solo came under fire and took Leia to cover. He then told Leia to get to the ''Falcon''. Solo returned to the caves and was confronted by Frax, who wanted revenge against Solo for dropping him into the Cordaxian Sea to be captured by the Empire. Solo tried to run, but was stopped by Frax and bounty hunters. However, Leia was able to light the droid on fire and escape Frax.<ref name=\"Annual 3\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Leia_go_back_to_Falcon.jpg|thumb|right|255x255px|Han and Leia make their way back to the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]\nAs Solo and Leia made their way back to the ''Falcon'', they were confronted by Frax, who attempted to shoot him despite Leia's threat to shoot him. Despite missing Frax, Leia was able to cause ice to come at him and freeze him to death. Solo and Leia were found by Chewie and taken to the Rebel fleet to recover.<ref name=\"Annual 3\" />\n\n====Fighting with the Partisans====\nSolo, along with Leia and Skywalker, went to [[Jedha]]. There, they [[Battle for Jedha|met]] and rescued [[Chulco Gi]] and former [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces]] soldier and [[Partisans|Partisan]] [[Ubin Des]]. After escaping the Imperial snowtrooper patrol, Solo took the ''Falcon'' to [[NaJedha]] so Leia could speak with Des about a meeting with the surviving Partisans. Solo allowed himself to be blindfolded and let Des and Gi fly the ''Falcon'' to the new Partisan base. Solo and the others were brought before [[Benthic]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 38\">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref> Solo told Benthic to either kill him or show them the Partisans' famous decisiveness.

Solo was able to destroy the citadel and return to the Partisans' base.<ref name=\"Star Wars 40\">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref> The Empire then deployed the ''Leviathan''. Solo, Leia, and Benthic looked at the ''Leviathan'' and saw no explosive that could damage it. After Des' explosives failed to make a dent in the ''Leviathan'', Solo flew an [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]] with Leia as his gunner. Together they rescued Des and her team from the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} tracks. Solo chastised Des for making a suicide run and told her not to do it unless there was no other choice. Solo was then informed Chewbacca was coming to help them finish off the ''Leviathan''. Solo met up with Chewie at the base after Skywalker rescued him with information from Shu-Torun.<ref name=\"Star Wars 41\">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>\n\nWith the Patisans, Solo and the others made a plan to attack the ''Leviathan'' using the plans Chewie acquired. Solo agreed to fly the mission and keep an eye on the partisans. As the partisans boarded the ''Falcon'', Solo and the others came under attack by stormtroopers. Benthic was wounded and Solo told partisans to get aboard the ''Falcon'' to escape. As the ''Falcon'' made its escape, Solo did not believe that Des should be leading the mission. Solo was reluctant to take the lead, but was convinced by Chewie to take charge since he was the ''Falcon''{{'s}} captain. Solo saw that the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} guns were down and led the partisans in attacking the stormtroopers stationed there.<ref name=\"Star Wars 42\">[[Star Wars (2015) 42|''Star Wars'' (2015) 42]]</ref>\n\nSolo and the Partisans were able to make their way to the bridge. On the bridge, Solo, Leia, Des, and the partisans were able to pilot the ''Leviathan'' into Jedha City's crater. Solo ordered the Partisans to barricade the bridge to prevent the Empire from stopping their plans. Solo and the Partisans were able to return to the ''Falcon'' before it fell into the crater. Solo took the partisans back to NaJedha. Benthic told Solo that he and his fellow partisans would guard Jedha's ashes until it was gone. Before leaving, Solo awarded Des the Medal of Bravery for her actions, even though it was a copy.<ref name=\"Star Wars 43\">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>\n\n====Crait====\nFrom the captain's seat of the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo led the defense of the Rebel fleet from an [[Attack on the Rebel fleet|attack]] by Imperial forces, buying time for the fleet to jump to [[Baraan-Fa]]. Shortly after, he accompanied [[Wedge Antilles]], Leia, Luke, and Chewbacca on a [[mission to Crait]], which the Alliance was considering as a location for its hidden base of operations. There they met [[Trusk Berinato]], an old ally of Bail Organa who Leia thought would help the Alliance. Instead Trusk had forged environmental reports and summoned SCAR Squadron to eliminate the Rebels. Solo attempted to evacuate Leia while Luke and Wedge engaged SCAR Squadron, but Trusk shot him in the shoulder. Leia returned fire, incapacitating Trusk as the Rebels regrouped and left the system aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Storms of Crait\">[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 The Storms of Crait 1|''Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 The Storms of Crait'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====Mutiny on Mon Cala====\nSolo took Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]], Skywalker, and Leia to Mon Cala. There, they met with Mon Cala's [[Regent]], [[Grand Admiral]] [[Dors Urtya]]. Ackbar and Leia asked Urtya for the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] to become part of the Rebel Alliance's fleet. Solo spotted a [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transport]] approaching their position and came under attack. The transport landed, and Solo approached the troopers. Solo was able to bribe the sergeant and toss a detonator into the transport. Solo called to Chewie to bring up the boat so they could escape. Solo drove the boat past several creatures. Unfortunately, Urtya refused to give the Alliance the fleet, and Solo took Leia and Ackbar back to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]]. There, he gave Skywalker a drink.<ref name=\"Star Wars 44\">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref> In the mess hall, they met up with Wedge Antilles, [[Derek Klivian|\"Hobbie\" Klivian]], and [[Zev Senesca]]. Together, they commemorated the fallen pilots of [[Red Squadron (Galactic Alliance)|Red Squadron]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 45\">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref>\n\nLeia arrived in the hall with a mission. With Skywalker and Chewie, Solo went with Leia to [[Dex Acquisitions Depot]] on [[Meor Ain]]. Together they broke into the depot's ultra-security brig and took the [[Clawdite]] Tunga Arpagion with them<ref name=\"Star Wars 45\" /> aboard the ''Falcon''. Solo and the others were able to convince him to pose as [[Moff]] [[Tan Hubi]] while they used him to free King [[Lee-Char]]. With Skywalker, Solo and Chewie were able to infiltrate the [[Moncaladrome]] through the refresher. Posing as an attendant, Solo bluffed his way past a officer by allowing her to dry her hands on Chewie. Solo was then given a tip, much to Chewie's chagrin. They were able to take Moff Hubi and switch him with Tunga.<ref name=\"Star Wars 46\">[[Star Wars (2015) 46|''Star Wars'' (2015) 46]]</ref>\n\nSolo flew a [[submarine]] to [[Strokill Prime]] to rescue Lee-Char. Chewie was able to use Hubi's bio-signature to get past Strokill Prime's defenses, in addition to codes provided by Queen Trios.<ref name=\"Star Wars 46\" /> Solo flew the submarine past a [[Opee sea killer|monstrous fish]]. Solo watched as Skywalker allowed the fish to swallow him. After Chewie rescued Skywalker from the fish, Solo took the submarine to the [[Unidentified Imperial base (Strokill Prime)|Imperial base]] and docked inside it. Solo and Leia stunned several of the guards. Unfortunately, they discovered that the king was on life-support and could not be moved.<ref name=\"Star Wars 47\">[[Star Wars (2015) 47|''Star Wars'' (2015) 47]]</ref>\n\nSolo and Skywalker argued about their next move. Solo and Skywalker searched for recording droid so Leia could deliver Lee-Char's words to his people. Solo found one and recorded Lee-Char's speech. After the guards killed Lee-Char, Solo and the others returned to the submarine to escape. On Mon Cala, Solo and the others met up with 3PO and [[Tunga Arpagion]]. They were confronted by Grand Admiral Urtya and several of his people who demanded Lee-Char's recording. After Urtya stunned Leia, Solo allowed him to take Lee-Char's recording. As Solo flew the ''Falcon'' away from Mon Cala, they were joined by the Mercantile fleet and a pair of Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"Star Wars 48\">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref>\n\nAs the Empire sent in bombers to destroy the ''Falcon'' and the Mercantile fleet, Solo was contacted by Urtya, who agreed to rebel against the Empire. They were then joined by the Rebel Alliance fleet under Ackbar, that would protect the fleet. Solo told Leia to get into one of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} turrets and destroy the bombers. Solo saw that the Empire was targeting the Mon Calamari's escape pods and took the ''Falcon'' to stop several TIEs before they could destroy the pods. After the ''Aurora Flare'' blew up and destroyed one of the Star Destroyers, Solo had the ''Falcon'' jump into hyperspace and escape with both the Rebel Alliance fleet and the mercantile fleet. Solo dropped Tunga off at the [[Cosmatanic Steppes]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 49\">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>\n\n====Escape from the Mako-Ta Space Docks====\nAt the same time as a Rebel party to celebrate the expanded Rebel fleet at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Solo, Chewie, and 3PO went to the [[Ring of Kafrene]] to meet with an [[Alaphani]] in a bar for a deal for a set of [[Transponder signal|transponder codes]]. C-3PO translated the [[Alaphani (language)|Alaphani language]] for Solo, and the deal went well. During the closing phases of the deal, Solo briefly joked about giving C-3PO to the Alaphani for 10 percent off. C-3PO was concerned by this, but Solo explained he was joking and that no Alaphani would accept that deal. Chewie then approached 3PO and Solo to alert them that two of Jabba the Hutt's bounty hunters were in the bar. After hearing this, Solo finished the deal, and the trio quickly left. The two bounty hunters followed, but Solo and Chewbacca hid behind their field of view to surprise them. Solo had C-3PO take the bounty hunters' weapons, and as the trio ran back to the ''Falcon'', Solo yelled back and promised that Jabba would get his money.<ref name=\"Star Wars 50\">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>\n\nC-3PO put the bounty hunters' weapons on the table on board, and Solo assured Chewbacca that they were not missing the party. He then explained to his partner that he had a contact who would pay them week for the set of codes. As the ''Falcon'' Chewie reminded Solo that Luke Skywalker had a role at the party, as he and other X-wing pilots planned to do a flyby for the gathered rebel allies. Solo admitted he would have liked to see it as well, and the ''Falcon'' left for the Space Docks.<ref name=\"Star Wars 50\" /> Solo arrived at the docks and found the Rebel fleet under attack by the Empire's [[Death Squadron]]. Leia said that Queen Trios had betrayed them and disabled all the cruisers and their hangar bays. Leia told Solo to fly into a bay door in order to open it. Solo, despite his better judgment, took the ''Falcon'' close to Star Destroyer and several TIEs following him as he made a run towards one of the cruisers. The ''Falcon'' then came under attack by Lord Vader in his [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 51\">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>\n\nSolo was able to evade Vader while Chewie tried to shoot him down. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' towards a [[Lajaie's cruiser|cruiser]] as Vader fired several missiles at him. However, Vader was able to force the ''Falcon'' away from the cruiser's hangar doors. After Commander [[Lajaie]]'s cruiser was destroyed, Solo decided to send a messenger to Leia by sending 3PO by escape pod. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' through the cruiser's debris, hoping Vader would not follow him. Chewie was able to launch 3PO to land on the [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']].<ref name=\"Star Wars 52\">[[Star Wars (2015) 52|''Star Wars'' (2015) 52]]</ref> Solo received helped from Skywalker's newly formed [[Rogue Squadron]]. Solo led the squadron in taking out the TIEs.<ref name=\"Star Wars 53\">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref>\n\nSolo was forced to land the ''Falcon'' on Ackbar's cruiser after taking heavy damage from Vader.<ref name=\"Star Wars 53\" /> He then took a [[Flight suit]] and took an X-wing and rejoined the fight. Solo and Skywalker came across a TIE that was acting weird and realized that an ally was aboard. Solo and Skywalker led the TIE back to the cruiser. There, they learned that Leia was the pilot and got her to the ''Republic''{{'s}} bridge. The ''Republic'' was able to escape into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Star Wars 54\">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref> Solo, Skywalker, and the rest of Rogue Squadron returned to help the surviving cruisers. Solo defended Leia and Skywalker's ship as they boarded the base to rescue Mothma and the other ambassadors. During the retreat, Solo and R2's X-wing was damaged but was rescued by a rebel ''Quasar Fire''-class carrier.<ref name=\"Star Wars 55\">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>\n\nAs the carrier went into hyperspace, it engines were fried and cruiser had to land on [[Corosi 7]]. Solo was unable to contact Ackbar or Chewie due to the Rebel fleet being kept hidden throughout the Outer Rim. Despite that, Solo was then given a promotion to the rank of [[colonel]] by Mothma, though he refused it. Solo then came up with plan to find Chewie and the ''Falcon''. Solo took Leia and Skywalker to Nar Shadaa to meet with Starros, who agreed to help them.<ref name=\"Star Wars 55\" />\n\nStarros was forced to drop them off on [[Hubin]], where they were stranded for weeks.<ref name=\"SW 56\">[[Star Wars (2015) 56|''Star Wars'' (2015) 56]]</ref> They eventually stole a shuttle when SCAR Squadron arrived.

The deflector shield which protected Echo Base from attack had been damaged and made inoperative, and the equipment aboard the lost ship was needed to repair the shield's generator. At dawn, Solo, Organa, and the rebel veteran Twi'lek General [[Hera Syndulla]] ventured into the frigid mountains in search of the lost ship. Throughout the day, however, Solo and Syndulla mastered tauntaun riding, while Organa had trouble controlling her beast and&mdash;to Solo's amusement&mdash;was de-[[saddle]]d.

After bringing Luke back to recover from his injuries, Han and Chewbacca went out to investigate a signal and encountered an [[XJ9-CS14|Imperial probe droid]]. Realizing the Empire had discovered their location, the Rebels decided to evacuate. During the [[Battle of Hoth|ensuing battle]], Han rescued Leia from the collapsed command center, leading her towards her transport.

While Solo was working on repairs, the ship drifted into an [[Hoth asteroid belt|asteroid field]]. Claiming that the Imperials would be \"crazy\" to follow them, Solo flew into the asteroid field, which would cause extensive damage to the pursuing Imperial Fleet.

Solo then decided to go to [[Cloud City]], a [[tibanna]] gas mine on [[Bespin]] run by his old friend Lando Calrissian.

Calrissian provided the rebels with lodging and promised to repair the ''Falcon''. While Han said he didn't trust Lando, due to his knowledge of Calrissian being a scoundrel, he appeared to be at ease in Cloud City, while Leia felt suspicious due to C-3PO going missing and then reappearing in pieces. Calrissian then invited Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca for refreshments, and told them about a deal that would keep the Empire out of Cloud City. To Solo's surprise, he led them into a room with Darth Vader. Solo immediately drew his blaster and fired several shots at the Sith Lord, but Vader blocked the shots and pulled the blaster out of Solo's hands with the Force.<ref name=\"SW:ESB\" />\n\nSolo was then tortured by the Empire, but he claimed they didn't even ask him any questions. When placed in a cell, Calrissian arrived and told the prisoners that Solo would be handed over to Fett, who would take him to Jabba, and that they were a trap set by Vader for Han and Leia's friend Luke Skywalker.

Leia, Chewbacca, Calrissian, Fett, and Vader looked on as Han was lowered into the carbon-freezing chamber and frozen. He survived the freezing process and fell into hibernation.

But this soon ended when Jabba bid with one million credits. With no other bids, Qi'ra congratulated Jabba and told him that the smuggler was his.

Solo was then placed in a prison cell with his partner Chewbacca, while Leia was taken as a personal slave by Jabba. After Leia was captured, Luke Skywalker arrived, and faced off against Jabba's prized Rancor, killing it. In rage, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and the Wookiee to be fed to the [[sarlacc]] in the Great Pit of Carkoon.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nAt the pit, Jabba offered the prisoners one last chance to plead for mercy, to which Solo replied that Jabba would receive no such pleasure from them.

In the ensuing struggle, Han was still mostly blind, rendering him unable to contribute much. However, after being told by Chewbacca that Boba Fett had joined the battle, Han unintentionally swung an axe into Fett's jetpack, sending him flying into Jabba's sail barge and then rolling into the sarlacc. After a blaster shot knocked Lando, disguised as a palace guard, off the skiff they were on, Han lowered the axe for Lando to grab, but Calrissian's foot was caught by one of the sarlacc's tentacles.

As part of the attack on the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], with Skywalker, Organa, and Chewbacca, Han commandeered the ''[[Tydirium]]'', a captured Imperial shuttle, and took a Rebel strike team to the forest moon of Endor to disable the shields protecting the superweapon. Shortly after landing on the forest moon, the strike team encountered a group of [[scout trooper]]s. Solo attempted to sneak up on them, but failed to do so, alerting them and allowing two to escape. Luke and Leia hopped on a speeder to pursue them, leaving Solo and the rest of the strike team behind.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nLuke eventually made his way back to the rest of the Rebels, without information on Leia. Luke, Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio set off to find Leia, while Han sent the rest of the strike team to move towards the shield generator. While looking, the group was captured by [[Ewok]]s. The furry tribesmen believed C-3PO to be a god, and attempted to cook the others at a banquet in his honor. However, Luke used the Force to levitate the \"god\" in a demonstration of his \"magic,\" frightening the Ewoks into releasing the others. At the village, the Rebels found Leia, and C-3PO managed to befriend the Ewoks.

After three of the four guards were distracted by the Ewok [[Paploo]], the Rebels neutralized the last guard and entered the shield bunker. But the operation proved to be a trap, and Solo and the Rebels were captured. However, the Empire had not expected the Ewoks to attack, which allowed the Rebels to escape. For most of the battle, Han stayed at the door, trying to open it. After R2-D2 was damaged attempting to open it, Han unsuccessfully tried to hotwire the door open. He then impersonated the pilot of an AT-ST that had been captured by Chewbacca and two Ewoks, getting the Imperials to open the doors. Han was then able to place detonators inside the shield generator, destroying it and leaving the Death Star vulnerable to attack.

Han outlined a plan for the Pathfinders and their Ewok allies to strike the outpost with limited air cover.

There, they found Solo while scouting the compound of the [[Siniteen]] prison designer [[Golas Aram]].

During their initial encounter, Solo was accosted by Mister Bones, who mistook him for a threat.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWorking together, Solo and Norra's team managed to breach the compound and capture Aram. Under duress, Aram told the rebels how to enter Ashmead's Lock. However, he omitted the password that would allow them unhindered passage inside the prison. Traveling to the Kashyyyk system in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Emari's ship ''[[Halo]]'', Solo and Norra's team gained clearance to land at Ashmead's Lock by claiming to be a repair team. Upon entering the prison, Han and the rebels were accosted by the prison's computer security system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], which dispatched security droids to integrate them.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nTemmin discovered that the prison was being powered by the prisoners who were being housed inside stasis cells. Using this information, Han and Norra managed to disable the power generator. As a result, Han and Norra's team were able to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. While Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones took the liberated prisoners back to Chandrila on the ''Falcon'', Han stayed behind with Chewbacca, Jas, Sinjir, and Jom to complete their mission to liberate the Wookiees.

The Wookiees and their rebel allies quickly overwhelmed the outnumbered Imperial garrison. When the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers began bombarding Kashyyyk, Han, Chewbacca, and their fellow rebels managed to evacuate the civilians underground. They then took a ship loaded with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]'' and fought their way through the ship's corridors. However, they were captured by stormtroopers who brought them before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nBefore the admiral could eliminate Han and his team, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the Kashyyyk system in the form of Leia and the ''Millennium Falcon'', Antilles' Phantom Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar's flagship, ''[[Home One]]''.

With the Wookiees undertaking mop-up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk, Han insisted that Chewbacca stay behind and reunite with his [[Chewbacca's family|family]]. However, he told Chewbacca that he would return if he ever needed help. Han then left Kashyyyk aboard the ''Falcon'' with Leia and their unborn child, [[Ben Solo]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n====Balancing family and duty====\nOver the next several months leading to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Han Solo and Princess Leia prepared for the coming of their child. With Leia approaching labor, Solo hired a protocol droid named [[T-2LC]] (or \"Elsie\") as a nanny. One day, Solo bought his wife a sack of [[jogan fruit]]s. Leia was annoyed with Solo for overdoing it and reminded him that Dr. [[Harter Kalonia]] had said to incorporate jogan into her diet and not to replace everything with it. While chatting with his wife about the liberation of Kashyyyk and galactic politics, Han and Leia were contacted on [[hologram]] by the New Republic operative Norra Wexley. Norra said that she was traveling to the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]] to hunt down Grand Admiral [[Rae Sloane]], the purported instigator behind the Liberation Day attacks on Chandrila.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\n[[Norra Wexley's team]] subsequently discovered that most of the Galactic Empire had retreated to Jakku. While Norra, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the battle droid Mister Bones infiltrated Jakku, Temmin and Sinjir returned to Chandrila with news about the Imperial presence. They visited Leia's domicile and warned Princess Leia and Han Solo about the Empire. Temmin tried to convince Solo to lend him his famous freighter, the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, Solo thought that the mission was too risky and was unwilling to risk his ship.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nBefore the argument could escalate, Chancellor Mon Mothma entered the domicile and asked Temmin and Sinjir about the Imperial presence on Jakku. Following the meeting, Temmin and Sinjir managed to convince Han and Leia to lend them the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, the two were stopped from leaving Chandrila by [[Senate Guard (New Republic)|Senate Guards]] who had been dispatched by Senator [[Tolwar Wartol]], a rival of Chancellor Mothma. Wartol had secretly installed a listening device inside T-2LC. In an attempt to discredit Chancellor Mothma, Wartol leaked news about the Imperial presence to [[HoloNet News]]. Solo and Leia learned about the leak while watching the morning news.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Unmasking a conspiracy====\nHan and Leia were later confronted by an angry Sinjir, who believed that they had double-crossed him and Temmin. Han and Leia managed to set the record straight. They then realized that Senator Wartol's leak and the Senate guards stopping Sinjir and Temmin were linked. When Sinjir voiced his suspicion that there was a spy bug in Leia's domicile, Han did not believe it, but Leia shared Sinjir's suspicion. Sinjir brought his former lover [[Conder Kyl]], a slicer, to Leia's domicile. Conder found that the listening device was inside T-2LC. Following the discovery, Han told Elsie to hold still and warned that it was going to sting a little.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nAfter removing the listening device and handing it to Chancellor Mothma, Han led a team consisting of Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell to the New Republic's new capital of [[Nakadia]]. Their [[Mission to Nakadia|mission]] was to investigate the five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send military forces to Jakku: [[Ashmin Ek]], [[Rethalow]], [[Dor Wieedo]], [[Grelka Sorka]], and [[Nim Tar]]. While Sinjir and the others trailed four of the senators at a restaurant called [[Izzik's]] in Nakadia's capital [[Quarrow]], Han went to spy on Senator Dor Wieedo. The Rodian senator was aboard his ship at the northernmost spaceport outside Quarrow.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nAfter several hours had passed, Solo witnessed two [[Nikto]] and a [[Klatooinian]] approach Wieedo's ship. Unknown to Solo, these aliens were members of the [[Red Key Raiders]], a crime syndicate that was plotting with Black Sun to prolong the war. Solo managed to warn his comrades. However, the criminals discovered his presence and locked him in a rubbish bin. Meanwhile, Conder was kidnapped by other Red Key gangsters. Sinjir and Temmin found Solo and returned to the ''Falcon''. Despite their setbacks, Jom managed to kidnap Senator Rethalow, who confessed to his dealings with Red Key and Black Sun.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nBefore they could spirit Rethalow away into hiding, Han and his team members decided to rescue Conder, [[Nim Tar's child]], and Sorka's [[Grelka Sorka's jerba|pet]] [[jerba]]. Conder used his [[transceiver tooth]] to transmit his coordinates to Sinjir. Han and his team flew the ''Millennium Falcon'' through a red warehouse roof, which turned out to be the Red Key's base. After subduing the gangsters, they rescued Conder and Nim Tar's child. Posing as an adviser to the Chancellor, Sinjir transmitted a missive offering the five senators pardons and other political favors if they changed their votes during the re-vote scheduled to be held at the [[Quarrow Senate house]]. As a result, Mothma's resolution passed, and the New Republic was able to dispatch military forces to Jakku.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====War's end====\n{{Quote|Yeah. You, me, Luke. Chewie. The ''Falcon''. Those two walking talking garbage cans. It feels weird we're not part of it.''\"<br>\"''We've got our own adventure.|Han and Leia|Aftermath: Empire's End}}\nFollowing the events on Nakadia, Han returned home and reunited with his wife. When Leia praised him for \"making things right,\" Solo told her that the Battle of Jakku was happening. He predicted that it would be a big battle. In private, Han confided that it felt strange that he, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were not part of the final battle. Leia reassured him that they had their own adventure. Han responded that it was the end of an era while Leia replied that it was the start of a new one.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nThe Battle of Jakku turned out to be a decisive victory for the New Republic. Facing imminent defeat, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] on Coruscant sent peace overtures to Chancellor Mothma. Han and his wife attended the peace talks where Chancellor Mothma and Grand Vizier Amedda signed the [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]]. The signing occurred during the third hour of Leia's labor, but she only told her husband after the ceremony was complete. Solo rushed her to the birthing chamber in the heart of [[Hanna City]].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n[[File:Han_Leia_and_Ben.jpg|244x244px|left|thumb|Solo with his wife and son]]\nLeia gave birth to a son named Ben Solo. Following a gathering of family and friends, Han stared into his son's eyes and pondered how he had become a father. While Leia was showering in the next room, Solo told his son that while the whole galaxy was against them, they would still make it through okay. Though Solo confided that he might not make a good father, he promised to keep them pointed in the right direction. Solo also gave Ben his first lesson: sometimes doing the right thing doesn't mean following a straight line. Solo told his baby son not to tell his mother.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWhen Ben cried, Han tried to comfort him with a small [[tooka doll]], but this failed to pacify the baby. Leia then heard her son crying. When Han said that it was not his fault, Leia reassured him that babies cried. Han sensed that Leia had a connection through the Force that he could never have with Ben. Han suggested using the Force, but Leia advised him to pick up their son and snuggle him. Han reluctantly snuggled his son and Ben stopped crying. When Han sighed that he could never have the same Force connection, Leia told him that fathers had a special connection with their offspring.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Losing the ''Falcon''====\n{{Quote|Short-handed?

[[Gannis Ducain]], who worked for Kanata, overheard and suggested he help on the job. The job was to deliver cargo to [[Christophsis]]. When Han and Ducain arrived, Han left Ducain to guard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst he met with his contact. Ducain, however, stole ''Falcon''. Ducain became a rich [[Smuggler|gunrunner]].

While staying in temporary quarters, he corresponded with Leia, who told her husband about the fractured state of the Galactic Senate. When Leia told Han about her desire to resign from the Senate, Han expressed puzzlement, since his wife had devoted much of her adult life to politics. Sensing Leia's frustration, Solo invited his wife to take a break and travel around the galaxy with him for three months. Despite their different personalities, Leia agreed that she needed a break from her senatorial career.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nHowever, Leia was forced to suspend her vacation plans after her faction, the [[Populists]], convinced her to stand for the position of [[First Senator]]. The rival [[Centrists|Centrist]] faction, which supported a stronger central government, had successfully passed a motion calling for the creation of First Senator in order to end the deadlock plaguing the Republic. Despite their initial opposition, the Populists, who preferred a more decentralized government, had decided to change tactics in order to prevent a Centrist from holding that office. Due to her prestige as a prominent former rebel leader, Leia had reluctantly agreed to allow an exploratory committee to explore her suitability for First Senator.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Han was repairing the rear engines of a starship, he was contacted by his wife. Solo was mildly disappointed with his wife's change of plans but agreed that a Populist should serve as First Senator. Solo also informed his wife that he was supervising the lunar relays of the Five Sabers. Due to the complicated nature of the repairs, Han remarked that he wished that Greer Sonnel, a former racer and [[Junior Sabers]] champion who was serving as Leia's pilot, was still on his team. When Leia apologized for delaying their planned holiday, Han reassured her that she was doing the right thing by putting duty to the New Republic first. Leia promised to take a break with her husband \"someday.\"<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nIn addition to the First Senatorship, Leia was involved in a sensitive Senate investigation into the Nikto crime lord [[Rinnrivin Di]]'s [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]], a new criminal outfit that was choking the economy of the [[Gaulus sector]]. Leia was assisted in this investigation by an unlikely ally, the idealistic Centrist senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]]. Over the course of their investigation, the two discovered that Rinnrivin was linked to a paramilitary faction called the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]]. In an attempt to sow discord, [[Arliz Hadrassian]], a former TIE fighter pilot who had become the Amaxines' leader, [[Napkin Bombing|bombed]] the [[New Republic senatorial complex]]'s [[Senatorial conference building|conference building]]. Leia survived the bombing and transmitted a voice-message telling her husband that she was safe and that he did not need to come to Hosnian Prime. While on Theron, Solo received news about the Senate bombing and saw footage of the damage. Later, Solo contacted Leia to send his wife a goodwill message and to keep in touch.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Leia was visiting [[Ryloth]] as part of her investigation, Han Solo sent a holomessage expressing hope that his wife's side project was going well. He informed her that the Five Sabers was heading to the fourth stage of the Sabers. Due to the sublight relay round, Han told her that he would be out of comm range for a while. He also told her to take care of herself and complimented her.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Rescue on Sibensko====\n{{Quote|Sorry, I'm late, sweetheart.''\"<br>\"''Honey, you're right on time.|Han reuniting with his wife on Sibensko|Bloodline (novel)}}\nHan and Leia would cross paths again due to unforeseen circumstances. Later, the Centrist Senator Lady [[Carise Sindian]], a secret agent of an Imperial remnant known as the [[First Order]], discovered information about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader on [[Birren]]. Alarmed at the friendship between Ransolm Casterfo and Leia, Lady Carise shared this information with him, knowing Ransolm's hatred for Vader. Feeling betrayed, Casterfo upstaged the Senate hearing into Leia's nomination for First Senator by revealing Leia's parentage to the assembled senators. This revelation destroyed Leia's credibility and forced her to withdraw her nomination.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nStill determined to continue her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines, Leia and her team took leave to travel to [[Sibensko]], where the two groups were hiding. There, Leia discovered that the Amaxines were funding Rinnrivin's cartel and were also marshaling troops, weapons, and starships for an attack on the New Republic. During her [[Mission to Sibensko|mission]], Leia was pursued by the Amaxine warriors and fled up a landing platform, where she was corned by two Amaxine starfighters. Han arrived on a [[Racing starfighter|racer]] and rescued his wife. Together, the couple shot down the enemy fighters. One of the fighters, a [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing]], collided with the underwater base's ammunition depot, triggering a massive explosion that destroyed the underwater city and the Amaxine army.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nFollowing the Sibensko mission, Han and his wife returned to Leia's apartment in Hosnian Prime. When Leia expressed despair that many of her former colleagues and comrades were shunning her for simply being Vader's daughter, Solo reassured her that this storm would pass and that people would remember her for who she was. Han counselled his wife to remember those friends who stuck by her and to ignore the rest of the galaxy. When Han criticized Casterfo, Leia sprung to her former friend's defense by pointing out that he was a decent man who hated Vader. Han then advised his wife to forget Casterfo and to use the political scandal as an opportunity to retire from politics for good.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nHowever, Leia still had one piece of unfinished business left: the findings of her investigation into Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxines. Leia wanted to address the Senate, but she needed to gain a quorum from a majority of senators. While Han thought that no more threats to the Republic existed with the demise of Rinnrivin and the Amaxines, Leia suspected that there were other like-minded groups seeking to overthrow the Republic. Han counseled his wife to rest for the night, and the couple expressed their love for each other.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThe following morning, the sports channels reported that Han Solo had left the [[Theron system]] after the end of the last Sabers round. There was also speculation on whether he would return for the final championship race. Later that evening, Han bought his wife [[Bilbringi]] cheesy meat pies for dinner. While eating, the couple received news that Leia had received a quorum to address the Senate due to Casterfo's favorable vote. Han then told his wife that things would improve and that he would stay with her for as long as she needed him. Leia reassured her husband that she would be able to handle the hearing on her own and told him that he could return to the Sabers championship. Shortly, Solo returned to the Five Sabers race.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Family strife====\n{{Quote|And Solo&hellip; Did you know that's not even his real name?

At some point, Han and Chewbacca obtained a [[Baleen-class heavy freighter|''Baleen''-class heavy freighter]] named the ''[[Eravana]]'' that they used for their smuggling operations and even assembled a crew to assist them.

The smuggler tried but failed to convince both gangs that he would fix things eventually, with one of the gang leaders threatening to take away the ''Millennium Falcon'' as payback. Han having just retrieved his vessel, responded that they would have to take it over his dead body.

As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] of their own.

However, they would need to do it before the Base fully charged its weapon. Having experience in taking down superweapons' shield generators, Solo and Chewbacca volunteered to disable the shield.

At first, Rey swore to make Ren answer for his patricidal actions, although Ren was more intrigued by the connection they shared than Rey's threats. Unable to understand the act of killing one's own father, Rey assumed that Ren hated his father, but the dark-side warrior insisted that he did not hate Solo, causing Rey to beseech him for an explanation.

Unable to persuade Skywalker to end his self-imposed exile, she concluded that the son of Han Solo was the last hope of the galaxy, and therefore went directly to Ren in the hope of helping him find redemption in the light. Her arrival on the [[First Order Navy]] [[flagship]] ''[[Supremacy]]'' provided Ren with an [[Battle of Oetchi|opportunity]] to [[assassin]]ate his dark-side mentor, Supreme Leader Snoke. Although they worked together to kill Snoke's [[Elite Praetorian Guard|Praetorian Guards]], Rey was dismayed to see that Ren did not intend to forsake his allegiance to the dark side.

Curious, he asked the rebel what had happened to him. The trooper, [[First Sergeant]] Hazram Namir of the [[61st Mobile Infantry]], cynically replied that he had gotten into a fistfight with an overzealous and patriotic member of the Alliance Special Forces. The captain just smiled and went back to his work. Later that evening, Namir&mdash;though the captain never got the man's name, and he never gave his&mdash;boarded the ''Falcon'' with a bin of mechanical parts with orders to give them to the captain on behalf of the Alliance deck crew. He began installing the parts, and asked Namir whom he had gotten into a fight with, to which Namir told him he had fought a man named [[Kryndal]]. Namir assisted the captain in repairing the ship for over thirty minutes, and when the captain finished&mdash;or maybe just gave up&mdash;he produced a bottle of [[Corellian whiskey]], and the two shared several drinks while Namir explained how he had ended up on cargo duty, and the captain how his freighter had been damaged. He identified with Namir, so he admitted that he was something like a mercenary, and hadn't joined the Rebellion because he believed in their cause. Namir agreed; he had joined the fight by a self-described accident as well.<ref name=\"Twilight Company\" />\n\nTime went on, and two men continued their personal discussions of beliefs and morals. The captain expressed his worry with the future state of galactic government&mdash;if the Alliance eventually conquered the Empire as they so hoped, men like him and Namir, who didn't believe in the Rebellion's cause, would be shunted once smugglers and mercenaries weren't required for the Alliance to operate. Namir wholeheartedly agreed, and secretly hoped the Galactic Civil War would go on forever. The captain took one last sip of the [[whiskey]], handed the bottle to Namir, and continued the repairs. Namir, too, went back on his business.<ref name=\"Twilight Company\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[Queen's Peril]]''\n*[[Queen's Peril (audiobook)|''Queen's Peril'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Defense]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*''[[5-Minute Star Wars Villain Stories]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''\n*''[[Most Wanted]]''\n*[[Most Wanted (audiobook)|''Most Wanted'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel]]''\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Meet the Crew]]''\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Train Heist]]''\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Han on the Run]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Solo Graphic Novel Adaptation]]''\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 1|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 1]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 2|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 2]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 3|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 3]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 4|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 4]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 5|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 5]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 6|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 6]]\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 7|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 7]]\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 1]] {{1stID|Cadet 124-329}}\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 2|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 2]]\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 3|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 3]]\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 4|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 4]]\n*[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 5|''Han Solo - Imperial Cadet'' 5]]\n*{{Galaxy of Adventures|Han Solo - From Smuggler to General}}\n*{{Galaxy of Adventures|Han and Chewie - A Lifelong Partnership}}\n*\"[[Chewbacca: A Wookiee Story]]\"\n*''[[Pirate's Price]]''\n*[[Pirate's Price (audiobook)|''Pirate's Price'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Lost Stars]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Lost Stars (audiobook)|''Lost Stars'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Lost Stars (webcomic)|''Lost Stars'' webcomic]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Starfighter Missions]]''\n*''[[Leia Organa: Ordeal of the Princess]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[Forces of Destiny: The Leia Chronicles]]''\n*''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]''\n*[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!
