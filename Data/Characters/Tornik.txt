When the message of Jabba's death reached the palace, [[Yarna d'al' Gargan/Legends|Yarna d'al' Gargan]] ran across the two drunks who attempted to [[Reproduction/Legends|rape]] her in their befuddlement. Fortunately, [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergrant]] [[Doallyn/Legends|Doallyn]] arrived just in time to protect her before they could commit their heinous act. He shot the Gamorrean in the back and escaped with Yarna into the desert.
