This may be an inside joke, however, as even after you beat her three times, and she claims that she will quit the game, you can still play her by saying \"I'd like to ask you some questions...\" She will continue to play.\n\nIf the player approaches her with [[B-4D4-GE3]] she refuses to play Pazaak saying \"Never play pazaak with droids\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{InsiderCite|135|Roll of the Dice}} {{Mo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mebla Dule\n|pl=Mebla Dule\n|ru=\u041c\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0430 \u0414\u044c\u044e\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dule, Mebla}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
