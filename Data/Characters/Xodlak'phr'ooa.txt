The family lived in [[Redhill province]] on the [[planet]] [[Celwis]].\n\nWhen the [[Agbui]] named [[Haplif]] came to Celwis with the young Chiss [[Coduyo'po'nekri]], Redhill province's [[Xodlak family]] [[Councilor (Chiss Ascendancy)|Councilor]] [[Xodlak'uvi'vil|Lakuviv]] tasked Lakphro with hosting the Agbui on his homestead. Lakphro cooperated unwillingly, although his wife and daughter were much happier with the arrangement. Over time, Haplif began to flood the market of Celwis with underpriced [[nyix]] jewelry as part of a [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|plot to bring the Chiss to civil war]]. Lakphro became highly suspicious of the [[nyix brooch]]es Haplif began giving to officials and Lakphro's own family, perceiving them as bribes.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nEventually, Lakphro sent a brooch Haplif gave his wife to his cousin [[Lakbulbup]] and his wife [[Dilpram]] on [[Naporar]] for metallurgical analysis. Lakbulbup, whose job involved staying up-to-date with [[Chiss Defense Force|military]] matters, suggested they send the brooch to a [[Chiss officer]] renowned for his masterful analysis of [[art]]. That officer was the legendary Senior Captain [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], who happened to be traveling with the [[Magys|leader]] of a group of refugees of [[the Magys species|the species]] who had manufactured the brooch. This led Thrawn and [[Senior Captain]] [[Irizi'in'daro]] to uncover Haplif's [[plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy]], allowing them to [[skirmish above Hoxim|foil it]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nLakphro, having grown suspicious of Haplif, confronted the alien just before the Agbui planned to leave Celwis. Haplif attempted to [[death|kill]] his former host, but Lakphro summoned a [[growzer]] with his [[lure stick]], and the growzer ultimately killed Haplif.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLakphro had a strong sense of integrity, and hated bribery and corruption. This morality led him to become suspicious of the [[Agbui]] he hosted at his ranch.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nXodlak'phr'ooa appeared as a secondary point-of-view character in the [[2021]] novel ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' by [[Timothy Zahn]]. In that novel, Lakphro had a fairly major role in the plot.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Celwis residents]]\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Xodlak family]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]"}}}]}}}}
