Known as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy during the [[Republic Era|final years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], Fett was proficient in marksmanship as well as [[Hand-to-hand combat|unarmed combat]]. The [[Boba Fett's armor|Mandalorian armor]] that he wore featured various weapons and gadgets, including a [[flamethrower]], dual [[WESTAR-34 blaster pistol]]s, and a [[jetpack]]. His personal [[starship]] was the [[Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft|''Firespray-31''-class patrol and attack craft]] ''[[Slave I]]''.\n\nHailing from the [[planet]] [[Concord Dawn]], Fett was a [[foundling]] of the Mandalorians and at one point fought in the [[Mandalorian Civil Wars]] before becoming a bounty hunter. Prior to the [[Clone Wars]], the [[Sith Lord]] [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]] hired Fett to serve as the [[DNA|genetic]] foundation of an [[army]] secretly [[Cloning|bred]] on the [[extragalactic]] world of [[Kamino]]. His DNA spawned millions of [[clone trooper]]s who shared his face, voice, and were trained to become soldiers. As part of his payment, Fett was given an unaltered clone whom he raised as his [[Fetts|son]], [[Boba Fett]]. In the last [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Separatist Crisis]], Fett was involved in the failed [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|plot]] to [[assassin]]ate [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] on [[Coruscant]]. The [[Jedi Order]] investigated the incident, forcing Fett to leave the [[Kaminoan]] [[homeworld]] after he was [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|confronted]] by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].\n\nKenobi tracked Fett to [[Geonosis]] where he discovered the [[bounty]] hunter's connection with [[Count of Serenno|Count]] Dooku and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Fett fought against the [[Jedi assault team]] during the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], and was [[Death|beheaded]] by [[Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]] in [[22 BBY]]. His legacy survived not only through the millions of clone [[trooper]]s that formed the backbone of the [[Republic Military]], but also Boba, who became a bounty hunter like his [[Parent|father]] before him. By the [[Imperial Era|era]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Boba possessed [[Boba Fett's armor|the same set of Mandalorian armor]] worn by Jango, although its appearance had been altered significantly.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Your father was a foundling.''\"<br />\"''Yes.

Talk about overkill.|Tiver|Age of Republic - Jango Fett 1}}\n[[File:JangoFett-SWZ.png|thumb|right|250px|Jango trained Boba while taking jobs and operating out of Kamino.]]\nFett continued to take jobs as a bounty hunter, which spread confusion throughout the bounty hunting community, as rumors had spread that Fett had a job with a mysterious client. A hunter named [[Neelda]] assumed Fett simply was not satisfied by doing only one job, although Fett was also looking to use such jobs to help in training Boba.<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\nAt some point during Boba's childhood, Fett brought him along on a [[Mission to Ord Mantell (Jango Fett)|mission]] to retrieve a [[Unidentified Twi'lek (Ord Mantell)|Twi'lek girl]] who had run away from home with her [[Falleen]] lover [[Griph]]. Fett and his son traveled to [[Telerath]] where they met with the team of bounty hunters they would be completing the mission with, a [[Rodian]] named Neelda, a [[Gand]] named [[Rinn (Gand)|Rinn]], and a [[Chadra-Fan]] named [[Tiver]]. The three bounty hunters agreed to let Fett bring Boba along on the mission, and the group departed for [[Ord Mantell]].<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\nDuring the flight from Telerath to Ord Mantell, Boba complained to Fett about having to work with the three bounty hunters, asking why they could not work with bounty hunters like Cad Bane, Zam Wesell, or Aurra Sing instead. Fett explained to his son that the point of the mission was to teach Boba about adapting to unknown conditions, hence working with bounty hunters Boba did not know.<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\nOn Ord Mantell, Fett and his team quickly tracked the Twi'lek and Griph to a bar where the two were discussing their plan to join [[Black Sun]]. While Boba and the trio of hunters cornered the lovers on the bar's balcony, Fett waited below in case his hunch was correct that the Twi'lek girl would jump. When she fell from the balcony, Fett caught and [[stun]]ned her. Fett then brought her unconscious body to ''[[Slave I]]'' in order to bring her back to her [[Unidentified Twi'lek's father|father]].<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\n[[File:Tiver_threatens_to_kill_Boba.png|thumb|left|250px|Rinn and Tiver threatened to kill Boba, Jango's son.]]\nReuniting with his son and the other hunters, Fett and Boba were betrayed by Rinn and Tiver. Tiver pinned Boba, commanding Fett to give them the Twi'lek girl and forfeit his share of the bounty or she would kill his son. Fett, confident in his son's abilities, told her she could try to kill him. Boba, having hidden a small [[blaster]] on himself before the mission, killed both Tiver and Rinn before turning his blaster on Neelda. Boba asked Fett for guidance, and Fett told him that what happened to Neelda was his choice. Because Neelda had not aided Tiver and Rinn but also had not opposed them, Boba allowed Neelda to leave alive but without his share of the bounty.<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\nAs Fett and his son left Ord Mantell to collect their bounty, the two discussed how Boba had done on the mission. Boba asked if he had done all right despite what had happened, and Fett told Boba that he had shot well, trusted his judgement, and started to build his reputation. Fett said that a father could not ask for a better start to his son's legacy.<ref name=\"Age of Republic\" />\n\n====Assassination plot====\n{{Quote|I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.''\"<br />\"''We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.

Fett had subcontracted the [[Clawdite]] bounty hunter Zam Wesell to carry out these attempts. After Wesell failed to [[Death|kill]] Amidala upon the Senator's arrival to [[Coruscant]], Fett provided her with a pair of deadly [[kouhun]]s and tasked her to kill Amidala in her [[sleep]]. The plan was foiled by two [[Jedi]] that had been assigned to protect the Senator, [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Wesell fled, but was apprehended by the Jedi after a lengthy pursuit throughout Coruscant. However, before she was able to reveal the identity of her employer to the Jedi, Fett killed her at a substantial distance with a [[Kamino saberdart]].<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Discovered by the Jedi====\n{{Quote|Do you like your army?''\"<br />\"''I look forward to seeing them in action.''\"<br />\"''They'll do their job well.

There, the two met under civil circumstances at Fett's apartment in [[Tipoca City]]. Fett was questioned by Kenobi, who wished to know the details surrounding the creation of the clone [[army]] and Fett's knowledge of [[Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]].

After Kenobi left, Fett told Boba they were leaving. However, on the landing platform where Fett's [[Starship|ship]], ''Slave I'', was docked, they were ambushed by Kenobi. The two battled for a short [[time]] before Kenobi went over the edge of the landing platform, giving Fett an opportunity to escape. Fett was followed to the planet [[Geonosis]] by Kenobi, who had placed a [[homing beacon]] on ''Slave I''{{'s}} hull. Fett led Kenobi on a prolonged [[Dogfight over Geonosis|chase]] through Geonosis' [[asteroid field]] and eventually locked onto his ship with a [[missile]], believing Kenobi to have perished.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Death on Geonosis====\n{{Quote|Whose helmet is that anyway?''\"<br />\"''It belongs to a bounty hunter I killed on Geonosis by the name of Jango Fett.|Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu|R2 Come Home}}\n[[File:Jangodied.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The battle between Jango Fett and Mace Windu ended with the mercenary's death at the hands of the Jedi Order's champion.]]\nFett later captured Skywalker and Amidala in the [[Geonosian droid factories|droid factory]] on Geonosis during their attempt to rescue Kenobi, who had been taken [[prisoner]] by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]]. In the [[Petranaki Arena]], during the scheduled execution of Amidala, Kenobi, and Skywalker, Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] led a [[Jedi assault team]] to rescue the three prisoners in what would be the [[First Battle of Geonosis|first battle of the Clone Wars]]. Fett protected Dooku during the skirmish, killing Jedi Master [[Coleman Trebor]] before joining the melee in the arena and attacking Windu. Fett tried to take [[Mace Windu's lightsaber|Windu's lightsaber]], but was run over by a stampeding [[reek]]. The reek charged at Fett a second time, who dispatched it with one shot. Fett was then rushed by Windu and began firing at the Jedi, who deflected the bounty hunter's shots.
