She'll die before she tells you anything.|Vuul Sarlin, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Ladonna Poe was a member of the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] smuggling ring of the [[Chirq Council]], best known as the Red Circle Gang. The ryll smugglers transported the spice onto Corellia on small ships and unloaded it at a [[Ryll Smuggler Base|bunker]] in the [[Vella plains]].<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> The ryll smuggling ring was led by the underboss [[Ubis Reendorr]].<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: The Unlucky Mayor|Corellia}}</ref> Ladonna Poe served as the contact of the ryll smuggling ring with [[Vuul Sarlin]] and his group of spice dealers in the city of [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]]. For security reasons, the spice dealers ignored that Ladonna Poe and the ryll smugglers were part of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" />\n[[File:Ryll_Smuggler_Base.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Ryll Smuggler Base]].]]\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> the [[Corellian Security Force]] started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]] questioned a local spice addict known as [[Menchi Lerann]]. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin. The spacer later interrogated Sarlin who was forced to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring, including the involvement of Ladonna Poe.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> The CorSec later targeted the Ryll Smuggler Bunker. Poe, who was outside the bunker when the raid started, was the first one to be killed. A CorSec agent later used her access card and enter the hideout. The CorSec forces then eliminated many ryll smugglers and destroyed several crates of spice. They also discovered the existence of the Red Circle Gang from the smuggler's mainframe.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLadonna Poe was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ryll_Smuggling_Ring_(card).JPG|cardname=Ryll Smuggling Ring}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|CorSec Case Files: Ryll Smuggling Ring}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poe, Ladonna}}\n[[Category:Chirq Council]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
