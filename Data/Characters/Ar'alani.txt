She was once a member of the [[Irizi family]]&mdash;one of the [[Nine Ruling Families]] that controlled the Ascendancy. The [[Vigilant (Chiss Ascendancy)|''Vigilant'']], a [[Nightdragon man-of-war|''Nightdragon'' man-of-war]], served as her [[command ship]] during and shortly after the [[Clone Wars]]. Later in the Imperial period, her command ship was the [[Chiss heavy cruiser]] [[Steadfast (Chiss)|''Steadfast'']].\n\n==Biography==\n===Cadet life===\nIn her youth, Irizi'aralani was known by her [[core name]] \"Ziara\" and attended [[Taharim Academy]], and rose to the rank of [[Senior Cadet]] in four years. While at the academy, she was on trial after a cadet under her tutelage, [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Mitth'raw'nuru]] \"Thrawn,\" was [[Mitth'raw'nuru's cheating charge|accused of cheating]] on a simulator exercise. During a luncheon break from the trial, Ziara invited [[General]] [[Ba'kif]] to the trial, who suggested that if they could not recreate the parameters as a simulation, Cadet Thrawn should try the real thing. Ziara watched as Thrawn perfectly executed the maneuvers he did in the simulation, and explained to the [[Irizi family]] [[Aristocra]] how he had pulled it off.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter having his name cleared, Thrawn invited Ziara out as a token of his gratitude for her help. He took her to an art gallery showcasing the history of the [[Chiss Ascendancy]], much to her dismay. Thrawn explained that art and military tactics are reflected in each other, and strengths and weaknesses can be seen in one's artwork. He broke down two civilizations, the [[Scofti]] and the [[Brodihi]], from their art. Ziara argued that everything he concluded was purely theoretical, and told him to study her own art, before the two of them dueled to see if he could find her tactical strengths and weaknesses. Thrawn easily countered all her attacks, and she was unable to block his. She changed up her attacks and was able to hit him a few times, before things went back to normal. After the bout ended, he explained her art and it's correlation with her fighting techniques, and noted he was unable to block her new set of attacks, before she switched back to her old ones, which he already knew how to counter.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Ascension in the ranks===\nSome time after their bout, Ziara, now [[Mid Captain]], aided [[Junior Commander]] Thrawn on a mission to the heart world of the [[Lioaoin Regime]] to take down a group pirates. After Thrawn informed the Lioaoin Regime he was searching for pirates, Ziara and her ship jumped to hyperspace, and Thrawn prepared to jump to hyperspace with his [[Pathfinder]], [[Qilori]]. The Lioaoin Regime patrol ships also had Pathfindes aboard, and would be able to follow Thrawn back to Chiss Space. They reached [[Kinoss]] where Ziara had set a trap for them. <ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nShortly after the destruction of the pirates, Ziara and Thrawn were reprimanded by General Ba'kif for launching a preemptive strike. Ascendancy protocol indicated that the Chiss should not attack unless attacked first&mdash;which they had ignored. Regardless, both of them had been promoted, Ziara to [[Senior Captain]], and Thrawn to [[Senior Commander]]. After dismissing Thrawn, Ba'kif asked Ziara for her assessment of Thrawn. She replied that he is an excellent tactician and strategist, but his political shrewdness is close to nonexistent. He placed Thrawn aboard the ''[[Parala]]'' as Ziara's Third Officer, in order to keep an eye on him. While discussing their roles with the Ascendancy, Thrawn informed Ziara that after the Lioaoin Regime would go back to piracy after they had replaced the ships she destroyed. He noted that they wouldn't try it with the Ascendancy, but they would go after other peoples that could not defend themselves. Ziara asked if he wished for the Ascendancy to be the protectors of the [[Chaos]], mentioning that would be the case should they interfere in the affairs of others. She told him that for the time being, non-intervention was the protocol, and until that changed, they must accept their orders and fulfill their duties.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nSome months after their respective promotions, Thrawn guided the Parala to the [[Garwian]] Colony [[Stivic]], where they had requested help against pirates. Thrawn informed Ziara that he hoped the presence of a Chiss Warship would scare away the pirates, and if it didn't, he would do nothing. Mentioning he could take on all four attackers, Thrawn asked for Ziara's permission to intervene, promising no major damage to the Parala. Thrawn requested leave to check the ranging lasers for calibration, and headed down to secondary command. With Ziara back in command, she informed her [[Executive officer|First Officer]] [[Clarr'os'culry|Roscu]] that she wanted to see the attack, and check if they had come up with new weapons or tactics. Just then, the pirates fired upon the Chiss Warship, and then immediately blew up. The pirates retreated, and Ziara ordered the helm to return the patrol circuit.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Promotion to Commodore===\nZiara came to the aid of Thrawn after he placed an emergency call, who was struggling to save an excursion liner from a planets gravity well. Thrawn had command of the ''[[Boco]]'', and was using its tractor beam to hold the liner from crashing into the planet. Ziara brought the Parala parallel to the Boco, and the Boco dropped its tractor beam and turned around to face the liner. Thrawn fired on the wings of the liner, lightening the ship. The Boco returned to the side of the Parala and together they pulled the lightened liner out, saving eight thousand lives.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nZiara and Thrawn made their way to the Chiss [[homeworld]] of [[Csilla]], where there was to be a hearing regarding their action. They passed by [[Csaplar]], a massive city that appeared to be frozen in ice. Ziara mentioned that their desired destination was underground, and would not be visibile from their current standpoint. The only loss from the hearing was that Thrawn had lost his command post of his first patrol ship, and Ziara had requested for him to be assigned to the Parala again as one of her officers. Ziara invited Thrawn to the [[Irizi family homestead]], where they would spend a few days before their new orders came in. On their way to the homestead, Ziara told Thrawn the truth about Csilla - how most people had moved from Csilla, while the others moved underground. The official record showed eight billion people living there, when in reality it was only sixty or seventy million. He asked why she had told him this, noting he wasn't senior enough for this information. Ziara replied that he thrives on information, and with more information he could come up with better tactics.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nSome time after the Irizi offered Thrawn the position of [[Trial-born]] with them, Ziara was promoted to [[Commodore]], losing her connection with the Irizi. [[Supreme Admiral]] [[Ja'fosk]] presented her with her new uniform and name - Commodore Ar'alani. During the promotion celebration, Thrawn approached Ar'alani and congratulated her, reminding her that he said she'd be here one day. Ar'alani had been assigned the ''[[Destrama]]'' and [[Picket Force Six]], and had requested Thrawn to be her first officer. Thrawn informed Ar'alani that Aristocra [[Irizi'stal'mustro]] \"Zistalmu\" of the Irizi had offered him the rank of tria-born within the family, and asked for her advice. Ar'alani brought him up to speed of the family politics, but ultimately left the decision up to him. Thrawn thanked her for her help, and for all she'd done for him over the years.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Fluke on Solitair===\nAr'alani and Thrawn were invited to the Garwian home world, where Security Chief [[Frangelic]] informed them the [[Ruleri]] would be present. While en route to the security center, Frangelic stopped at the [[Creators' Market]], noting that it was one of the finest representations of Garwian culture and he wished to share it with them. He led them to a woman named [[Mimott]], who created extravagant clothes for [[Remembrance party]]'s, much to Ar'alani's amazement. She mentioned that she had never thought of aliens as people and began humanizing them, asking Thrawn whether he always saw them for what the were. He replied that he saw them as people, but he truly saw them as assets. When they reached the security center, alarms began to blare indicating [[Solitair]] was under attack by the Lioaoin Regime. A Garwian general asked Ar'alani for her help, which she could not give. Thrawn was about to give them info about their attackers when Ar'alani cut him off, which earned her more pleading from Frangelic. Ar'alani pulled out her comm unit to contact the Destrama, but their was no answer. Thrawn asked the Garwian General to lift their jammer. After a few moments the Garwians lifted their jamming, and Ar'alani question what their goal was. They informed her that there used to be six outer worlds of the Garwians, and soon there will be six again. Ar'alani prepared to leave, and warned the Garwians that Thrawn's insights regarding blind spots weren't limited to those of [[Lioaoi]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Skirmish against the Paataatus===\n[[Admiral]] Ar'alani, now commander of the [[Nightdragon man-of-war]] class [[Vigilant]], joined Thrawn and the Springhawk on a mission to attack the [[Paataatus]]. During the skirmish, Thrawn turned his ship away from the Vigilant, forcing the Paataatus to fire upon him, giving the other ships an opportunity to fire back without confusion from the gunners or computers. Ar'alani commended Thrawn on the maneuver, but also requested him to share his plans before executing them. Ar'alani informed Thrawn that they had it under control, giving him leave to continue on his next mission. Ar'alani travelled in-system to speak with the Paataatus leaders, to confirm they understood what happens when they attack the Chiss Ascendancy. Following the attack, Ar'alani and her first officer, Senior Captain [[Wutroow]] were called in for testimony in the Aristocra hearing room. Since Thrawn was unavailable, Ar'alani and her first officer were summoned by the Aristocra in hopes they would say something derogatory about him for disobeying orders. Ar'alani instructed Wutroow to answer honestly, but also said she herself would spiral her answers slightly. The pair entered the hearing room, and stood ready for questioning. The syndic for the [[Clarr family]] spoke first, asking Ar'alani if Senior Captain Thrawn had in fact disobeyed a direct order. Ar'alani replied that he disobeyed a lesser order, later correcting herself that while disobeying an order, Thrawn carried out a more important priority, which was to protect the ascendancy and win the battle. She compared Thrawns actions to those of the syndics, noting that their first priority was to the ascendancy as a whole and the second to their respective families. The Syndicure dismissed Ar'alani and Wutroow, after the latter informed the Syndicure of a report showing the Paataatus knew where they were going to be attacked, which she received from someone in her family.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Mission to Rapacc===\nAr'alani received a message from Thrawn requesting her to meet him at the given coordinates, with instructions to bring only the Vigilant and to not hire a navigator. Ar'alani instructed Wutroow to set course for [[Naporar]] to pick up their [[sky-walker]]. After reaching Thrawn's coordinates, Ar'alani and Wutroow shuttles across to the ''Springhawk'', where the pair and Senior Captain [[Samakro]] read through Thrawn's data and proposal. Thrawn had found the system the two refuge ships with dead bodies had come from, and planned to pull the same maneuver he used at Taharim Academy to enter the [[box system]], using the ''Springhawk'' instead of a patrol cruiser. Ar'alani asked what his exit strategy was, and he replied that he would go through the gas giants, where they could holes to pop in and out of. Ar'alani agreed to his plan, only ordering him to send his sky-walker [[Che'ri]] and her caretaker [[Thalias]] aboard the Vigilant to keep them safe. Thrawn countered that he needed Thalias, mentioning he felt that the guard would be less likely to attack if he had a woman with him, and he could not take any officers because he wanted the ''Springhawk'' combat ready at all times. The plan was to have the ''Springhawk'' fly alongside the Vigilant and hide in its shadow until it could enter the asteroid cluster undetected, and added course changes to draw away suspicion the blockade ships might have. The two ships reaches the asteroid cluster where the ''Springhawk'' broke off and entered undetected, and the Vigilant jumped to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nWith Che'ri aboard the Vigilant, Ar'alani entered the [[Sky-walker suite]] to check on Che'ri and informed her that Thrawn, Thalias, and the ''Springhawk'' had made it safely to their destination. The Vigilant's sky-walker, [[Ab'begh]] requested that Che'ri's bed be put next to hers, to which everyone agreed. Ar'alani bade farewell to the girls and their caregiver, and took her leave.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Escape from Urchiv-Ki===\nDuring the skirmish over Rapacc, Thrawn had captured a [[Nikardun]] ship, which he and Ar'alani presented to General Ba'kif. Ba'kif argued that it was a serious violation of protocol, with Ar'alani retorting that capturing a ship isn't a breach. Ar'alani and Thrawn informed that they believed the Nikardun Destiny were in league with the Lioaoin Regime, and requested permission to go to the Lioaoin heart world in person, a mission that would be kept quiet. Just then, [[Mitth family]] Syndic [[Thurfian]] and [[Irizi family]] Syndic [[Zistalmu]] entered Ba'kif's office together, which Ar'alani found very suspicious. Thurfian and Zistalmu shot down Thrawn and Ar'alani's proposed mission, noting the ''Springhawk'' was undergoing repairs and the ''Vigilant'' was being sent to [[Urch]], the capital of [[Urchiv-ki]], where a new ambassador was being sent. The synics had also reassigned sky-walker Ab'begh from the ''Vigilant''  and assigned sky-walker Ch'eri to it, as were caregiver Thalias and Senior Captain Thrawn.  Ch'eri brought the ''Vigilant'' into the Urchiv-Ki system, and had to take a detour that forced them to arrive several hours late, much to the annoyance of [[Ambassador]] [[Ilparg]]. During Ilparg's groveling, Thrawn showed Ar'alani a ship that he believed was Lioaoin. Ilparg, once again listing his complaints, was told sternly to stop talking by Ar'alani. She and Thrawn counted eight ships: the single Lioaoin, six Urchiv, and a Nikardun frigate.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThey wondered whether the Urchiv-Ki has been conquered or if they were still resisting the Nikardun. Ar'alani rose from her command chair and went over to sky-walker Che'ri, and asked her to find an exit vector that was quicker and easier than the rest. Che'ri gave the vector, but Wutroow informed the admiral that to reach the vector, the ''Vigilant'' would have to angle outward and therefore move straight into the net created by the enemies. She replied that they wouldn't necessarily have to angle outward, and ordered the ''Vigilant'' forward, with an additional three course changes which took the enemies off their tail, and then jumped to hyperspace. An angered Ilparg asked how and what had just occurred, and Ar'alani informed him that the Nikardun wanted to capture a Chiss ship, and used him as bait. Ar'alani also pointed out the thr Lioaoin ship was present, and did not interfere implying they were in league with the Nikardun. She suggested they travel to the Lioaoin heart world to demand an explanation, to which Ilparg agreed.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Mission to Lioaoin Heart World===\nChe'ri brought the ''Vigilant'' to the Lioaoin heart world, and Ilparg demanded to speak with someone in the [[Regime Diplomatic Office]]. Ar'alani advised him to wait until Thrawn was present on the bridge, much to Ilparg's annoyance. Thrawn arrived on the bridge, apologizing that his studies took longer than he expected. Ilparg questioned his studies, claiming Thrawn's study of art was a waste of time. Ar'alani came to his defense, saying that the first rule of strategy is to know your enemy, and that includes their battle tactics, history, philosophy, and their art. Thrawn pondered why the Lioaoin ships were hesitating to attack, noting nine ships in particular. The voice of a person from the [[Lioaoin Orbital Command]] echoed over the speaker, and Ilparg replied that he demanded to speak to someone about their treatment at Urchiv-Ki. Ar'alani began to stop him from revealing the information, when Thrawn stopped her, to see what the reaction of the Lioaoin's would be. Just then, a massive [[Battle Dreadnought class]] Nikardun warship came into view, and Ar'alani ordered Ilparg to say his farewells so they could leave.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn asked Ar'alani for permission to run an experiment with the nine gunboats the pair had noticed earlier. Thrawn spoke to the Lioaoin Orbital Command, and noticed the seven of the nine gunboats moved forward at the mention of his own name, and then promptly moved back into position. With that, the ''Vigilant'' jumped into hyperspace. Wutroow asked her Admiral what they had learned, and Thrawn responded that the pilots of the seven gunboats had standing orders regarding him, but someone higher in command countermanded the order. It also showed that the Lioaoin weren't just subjects of the Nikardun, instead they were allies. Thrawn asked Ar'alani if she could take the ''Vigilant'' to Solitair, and to borrow her office for two hours. She agreed, and instructed Thalias to bring Che'ri out of [[Third Sight]] when it was safe and have her redirect to Solitair. While en route to Solitair, Thalias agreed to accompany Thrawn as his [[Chiss family hostage]], leaving Che'ri without her caregiver. Ar'alani allowed Thalias to choose who she'd like to take care of Ch'eri while she was on Solitair with Thrawn, and Thalias chose the admiral herself. When Ar'alani went to check on the young girl, she found her curled up in oversized chairs, and asked if she was upset that Thalias had left her. Che'ri replied that Thalias told her she had to go but wouldn't tell her why. Ar'alani sympathized with her, mentioning that it used to bother her when she was young as well. Che'ri blamed herself for Thalias leaving, noting that she yelled at her for not giving her [[Graph marker]]<nowiki/>s. She began crying because she feared that Thalias was going into danger and was going to die, and Ar'alani did her best to comfort her by saying that Thrawn was with her and he wouldn't let anything happen to her. Ar'alani told Che'ri she would draw her a hot bath and then make her whatever she wanted to eat, and the young sky-walker agreed. Che'ri asked Ar'alani to tell her some stories about Thrawn, because Thalias gave her some but she didn't read very well. Ar'alani let out a quiet sigh, realizing that it was going to the a long night.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Extracting Thrawn from Primea===\nAr'alani sat in front of General Ba'kif and Aristocra's Zistalmu and Thurfian, facing heat from all three for separating a sky-walker and her caregiver as well as letting Thrawn insert himself in to Garwian politics once again. Ar'alani replied that Thrawn's mission was simply reconnaissance, trying to figure out if thr Nikardun had established their presence any where else. Thurfian countered that since the Nikardun had not yet attacked the Ascendancy nor show any indication that they might, it was a political matter and not military. Ba'kif interjected that the discussion would continue after Thrawn had returned and would be able to properly defend himself, noting that the issue at hand was figuring out how to safely extract him from Solitair. Zistalmu replied that Thrawn got himself into the mess and he should be responsible to get himself out of it, but Thurfian countered that letting him have his way could bring more diplomatic and political consequences. Ar'alani said her extraction mission would be straightforward, she would take the Vigilant to the [[Primea system]] and and arrange a pickup, noting that the Ascendancy had no quarrel with the [[Vak]]. Thurfian said that Ar'alani and the Vigilant would be on their way as soon as the ships sky-walker dilemma was solved, and Ar'alani countered that she promised Che'ri's caregiver she would take care of her. Zistalmu mentioned that his wife served as a caregiver for some time, and she could be reinstated to be Che'ri's temporary caregiver. Ar'alani disagreed, not wanting a strange woman not a Syndic on her ship, but Ba'kif accepted Zistalmu's offer and ordered him to call ha wife and report to the Vigilant. Ba'kif held Ar'alani for a few moments, saying while it was not ideal, it was the only way, not to mention the fact that she had not mandate because Thalias wasn't an official caregiver. Ba'kif informed Ar'alani that Thurfian helped Thalias sweet-talk her way on the to the Springhawk, and guaranteed that there was a cost for his help. Ba'kif stated that Thurfian could have mentioned Thalias not being an official caregiver, but he didn't. He also noted that despite their family rivalries, Thurfian and Zistalmu have shown remarkable unity in their joined efforts to get Thrawn out of the fleet. Ba'kif concluded that Thurfian still wants something from Thalias, or else he would have had her removed from the Springhawk. He ordered Ar'alani to watch Zistalmu closely, stating that the Syndic wouldn't voluntarily walk into trouble unless he could manage to benefit his family from it.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nWhile en route to the Primea system, Ar'alani confronted Zistalmu on why he and Thurfian hates Thrawn. Zistalmu replied that they don't hate Thrawn, and actually admire his military skill. He said they resist him because they considered him a threat to the Ascendancy. Ar'alani countered if he meant a threat to the Ascendancy or the Irizi family, to which he replied that she didn't see what he meant and there was no point in continuing the conversation. Ar'alani pointed out that she was aboard her ship and he was subject to her authority, and ordered him to explain how Thrawn was a thread tot he Ascendancy. He replied that there wasn't enough time for a proper explanation, but pointed out that she'd seen enough of his career and if she didn't see what he meant, it's because she chose not to. With that, the Vigilant exited hyperspace and entered the Primea system. She ordered Wutroow to identify themselves to the planetary diplomatic office and let them know they were trying to reach Artistic Master [[Svorno]]. Wutroow replied that the Garwian ship left three days ago with all personnel aboard, and Ar'alani asked for a list of all personnel aboard the ship as well as copies all transmission to and from the ship. [[Obbic'lia'nuf|Biclian]] reported that five small ships were breaking orbit towards them and another nine patrol ships from the surface. Wutroow noted that thirteen of ships were working into a lens formation, and the fourteenth was moving forward. Ar'alani ordered Octrimo to start subtly drifting toward the fourteenth fighter, wondering if it was Thrawn. The fighter fired on the Vigilant, and continued modulated laser fire on the Vigilant. Zistalmu figured out that the fighter was Thrawn and the modulated laser fire was a means of communication, a secret that until now only Thrawn and Ar'alani knew. Two patrol ships began pursuing Thrawn, and two additional warships began moving steadily towards the Vigilant off to portside. Suddenly, a Nikardun warship appeared, and Thrawn had also transferred a schematic of the Vak patrol ships that highlighted their weak points. Ar'alani ordered for the lasers to target only the weapons sensors of the patrol ships, to which Zistalmu retaliated, saying they had not been attacked yet. Ar'alani countered that one ship had fired upon them, and they did not know for a fact if it was Thrawn or not.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nJust as Zistalmu began to forbid any action, Biclian reported that four heavy cruisers were coming in from hyperspace, and they turned out to be Lioaoin heavy cruisers. Ar'alani informed the Lioaoi that they meant no harm to Primea, and were simply inquiring the whereabouts of a missing person. All four Lioaoi ships opened fire on the Vigilant, and Ar'alani noted that it would take at least half a dozen plasma sphere impacts to neutralize a single ship, and there was four of them. She asked Octrimo what their best course out of the battle was, fending off Zistalmu's protests in the process. Octrimo replied that the best exit vector was portside, but it would take them into close combat range with Lioaoin ships three and four. Ar'alani ordered weapons to concentrate spheres on ship three, as both three and four began moving sideways to block the Vigilant's escape. Thrawn's hijacked patrol ship shot past the Vigilant and opened fire on ship four, destroying its combat ability before they could figure out why a Vak patrol ship had fired upon them. Thrawn's patrol ship was hit, and the Vigilant brought him in with its tractor beam. As soon as his patrol ship was secured, the Vigilant jumped to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Return to the Lioaoin Heart world===\nThe Vigilant and the Springhawk went on their way to deliver a message to the Lioaoi, and met at a rendezvous system, and both ships' commanders and senior officers met aboard the Vigilant for a final briefing before making an easy jump by jump to the Lioaoin heart world. Ar'alani hailed the twelve warships that were headed their way, announcing that ships of the Lioaoin Regime attacked a ship of the Chiss Ascendancy, and asked if they had an explanation before this Chiss passed judgement. Thrawn realized that the Nikardun were present, either on the surface or aboard Liaoain ships. Thrawn informed Ar'alani of the four approaching warships, and she ordered him to ready the probe. The probe, really one of the Vigilant's shuttles, was meant as a distraction for the Laiaoi, and they soon took control over the shuttle by jamming the Vigilant's control signal. The Lioaoi gained full control of the shuttle and sent it on a vector that would take it through the center of the Lioaoin formation. Once it reached the center, Thrawn ordered to fire on the shuttle, which sent out breacher missiles that headed towards each ship. The damage was minimal, but all four ships lurched violently, breaking formation. The Vigilant's lasers flashed out, and the second shuttle which had been towed behind the first sent out its own breacher missiles into each of the warships. Ar'alani once again asked for an explanation, but the four Lioaoin ships started falling back with two more rising from defense orbit. Ar'alani informed the Springhawk they were sent to deliver a message, and they would do so, and Thrawn instructed his bridge to prepare for combat.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Planning against the Nikardun===\nSome five weeks after their departure to Lesser Space, Thrawn and Che'ri returned to the Csilla system with a [[Republic]] [[energy shield]], that was brought aboard the Vigilant. Ar'alani remarked that the shield generator was light years beyond the [[Electrostatic barrier]]<nowiki/>s, they had been using, but Thrawn replied that their advantage would only be temporary, noting that their enemies would try to replicate or steal it. Ar'alani wondered why [[Yiv]] did not have something like the shield generator, and Thrawn replied that he might and was only saving it for a later time. Thrawn stated that they, however, could not afford to wait and would have to use it against Yiv before he knew it. Ar'alani warned that he might already know, considering the noise that he and [[Jedi]] [[General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] made on [[Batuu]] and [[Mokivj]]. She stated it was a bizarre coincidence regarding the Jedi\u2019s last name, and Thrawn replied that to his understanding, it wasn\u2019t an uncommon name in parts of Lesser Space. Ar'alani asked Thrawn what his plan was, and he replied that it was clear that he and the Nikardun were not ready to face the Ascendancy yet, and that he was still working on being the Vaks completely under his control. He aimed to drive a wedge between the Vaks and Yiv, which should either halt his plans completely or buy them enough time to convince the Syndicure that the Nikardun were indeed a threat. Ar'alani also noted that Primea was important to him not only for the Vaks, but also as it was a center of trade and diplomacy for the entire region, and an endorsement from the Vak leaders would allow Yiv easy access to all the other nations. Thrawn laid out his entire plan, which Ar'alani decided was not only illegal but also insane. Thrawn replied that if she did not want to go along with it, he would do it alone with Thalias and Che'ri. Thrawn replied that his message would get to the Vaks and they would come to his aid, but Ar'alani stated that they would come to his aid only if they received the message and chose not to ignore it. Ar'alani was firm in her belief that his plan was insane, even for him, also noting that his reading of Yiv and the Vaks could be wrong. She also noted that he had been wrong before, referencing his failure with the Garwians. Thrawn said this was different, as it was a an issue of war and not politics. Despite her reservations, she agreed to his plans, and stated that they would need the Vak fighter they brought back from Primea, the Republic shield, and a customized freighter to hold it, in addition to permission from Ba'kif and Ja'fosk.\nAfter sending Che'ri and Thalias aboard the Vak fighter to Primea and receiving word of their capture, Ar'alani was present \u00a0at the [[Convocate Hall]] for the Syndicure\u2019s emergency meeting. Ja'fosk read General Yiv\u2019s demands for the release of Thalias and Che'ri, and the Syndicure planned their steps to get them back. Zistalmu asked if they would order a military strike, but Thurfian countered that the Nikardun were not their enemies, and could not attack them. Thrawn stated that they had taken a sky-walker, which itself constitutes as an attack on the Ascendancy. The Syndicure agreed, and sent Thrawn aboard an unarmed freighter alone to Primea, just as Yiv has requested. <ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Battle over Primea===\nAboard the Vigilant, Ar'alani discussed the upcoming battle with Wutroow, noting that if the Vaks had indeed fallen under control of the Nikardun, they would not be allowed to attack them unless fires upon first. Wutroow asked her admiral how good the Republic energy shield really was, and Ar'alani replied she wasn\u2019t sure. Wutroow went off to runs the weapon crews through final system check, and Ar'alani made arrangements for sky-walker Ab\u2019begh to be taken off the bridge upon arrival. When the Vigilant arrived above Primea, Ar'alani asked [[Primea Central Command]] if they had received the message from Senior Captain Thrawn, to which they replied in the affirmative. They asked for confirmation of the identities and locations of the Nikardun vessels, and the admiral informed them her officers were working on it. The Chiss ships counted thirty two Nikardun vessels, and the Vigilant sent their profile to Primea Command. They asked if they were subject to a Nikardun blockade, which Ar'alani confirmed. They agreed to hold their defense ships back while the Chiss cleared the way. She told her task force they had their targets and ordered them to engage at will. During the battle, the three Battle Dreadnaughts that had been stationed aside General Yiv\u2019s own Dreadnaught, the [[Deathless]], appeared, and Ar'alani ordered her task force to split up and keep the occupied. While the Springhawk was being battered down and out-played by the Dreadnaught, Ar'alani offered some much needed timely assistance, and asked Mid Captain Samakro if he remembered the maneuver Thrawn pulled against the Pataatus when he first took command over the Springhawk. She ordered him to come out from his spot and angle toward low orbit, and then ordered him to go dark. The Springhawk shut down all its systems, and Ar'alani called upon the Vaks for humanitarian aid. The Vaks agreed, and sent two patrol ships to render aid, with warnings from both the Vaks and Ar'alani to the Nikardun to not fire upon them. Heedless of the warnings, the Nikardun fired upon and destroyed both patrol ships, causing the Vaks to send in their forces against the Nikardun. Together, the Chiss and the Vaks overpowered the Nikardun, and Thrawn was able to deliver General Yiv to the council alive interrogation. Thrawn later revealed to Thalias and Che'ri that Ar'alani realized that in Vak history, all of their enemies were careful to never kill a Vak in combat, because to the Vaks an attack one one is an attack on the entire society.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===Cleaning up Nikardun bases===\nSome time after Yiv\u2019s capture, Ar'alani, along with Thrawn and the Springhawk and Senior Captain [[Lakinda]] and the [[Grayshrike]] were engaged in battle with Nikardun remnants. The three Chiss ships easily took care of their attackers, and Ar'alani gave Thrawn permission to take his leave and continue on his mission. Wutroow questioned if this had to do with the conversation that she and Thrawn had with Ba'kif before they left for this mission, but Ar'alani did not give her an answer. Following Thrawn\u2019s departure, the Vigilant and Grayshrike traveled to their next stop, another Nikardun base in the region. Upon arrival, they found three badly damaged ships, and the Grayshrike found another six. Ar'alani ordered a full sensor scan to find out what weapons were used in the attack. She then ordered Octrimo to move closer to the derelicts and to be ready to go evasive, also mentioning she didn\u2019t like the idea of someone with this much military strength around this part of the chaos. Wutroow stated that they shouldn\u2019t spend too much time on it, mentioning the Aristocra already don\u2019t like they idea of mopping up the Nikardun as far as they are. Junior Commander [[Stybla'rsi'omli|Larisom]] informed Ar'alani of message coming from [[Schesa]] as a relay from Csilla from Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk. The message was an order for Thrawn and the Springhawk to return to Csilla for a new assignment. Wutroow pointed out that it was the Syndicure who had summoned Thrawn, noting that had it been Ja'fosk or Ba'kif, they would have asked him to complete his mission first. Ar'alani dispatched Lakinda and the Grayshrike to the Rapacc system to deliver the message to Thrawn, who was out of comm range. Ar'alani and the Vigilant continued on their mission, setting their destination for one of the last two Nikardun [[listening posts]]. Wutroow brought up the point that the Nikardun ma have left their unflyable ships at their current location ridden with lasers and missiles in hopes of the Chiss assuming the final two listening posts had been destroyed, but were actually assembling their forces there. Ar'alani replied that if that were the case, they would inflict as much damage as possible and run, and come back after they had rendezvoused with the Springhawk and the Grayshrike.\n\nThe Vigilant arrived at the final base on Yiv\u2019s list, only to find silence and more debris. Wutroow noted that the base looked too big for a listening post, and found it odd that all the other bases had been marked by size and purpose, and this one had not. Ar'alani agreed, and abruptly ordered Biclian to scan a clump of debris that she felt was too close together. He reported that it could be the remnants of an asteroid, and Ar'alani then ordered him to find the overall vector of the debris and Octrimo to take them in closer to it. After both had had carried out their respective orders, Ar'alani revealed that the asteroid had broken apart directly in front of the gap in the stations she\u2019d identified as the first point of impact. The asteroid had drifted through the base\u2019s defense perimeter, and shattered open to reveal the [[Missile launcher]] inside it, which blasted away at the base\u2019s hull. Ar'alani ordered a full sensor scan on all the debris, a squad to check out the base, and a shuttle to check out the asteroid fragments.<ref name=\"Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good\" />\n\n===Skirmish over Sunrise=== \nAr'alani and the Vigilant, along with Lakinda and the Grayshrike arrived above [[Sunrise]], finding the planet and its surrounding areas completely empty. Biclian reported movement coming from the starboard side of the planet, and had her crew scan it. She ordered Lakinda to shift her scans to aft and flanking, much to Lakinda\u2019s dismay. Biclian reported the object was about the size of the Vigilant and irregularly shaped, when Wutroow realized it was a moon, which Biclian confirmed, also adding it could be an asteroid. Ar'alani ordered a reading on its orbital eccentricity, and asked Lakinda if the object was in orbit or on the other side of the planet during her time above Sunrise. Lakinda replied that they were going through the battle records, and asked Wutroow if they suspected it was another camouflaged missile launcher, which Ar'alani confirmed. Ar'alani asked Wutroow to retrieve Thrawn\u2019s records of the battle the Springhawk and Grayshrike partook in over Sunrise to check if she could spot the asteroid anywhere. Ar'alani asked Lakinda if she was ready to try something dangerous, to which she replied in the affirmative. <ref name=\"Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good\" />\n\n=== Later life===\nBy the [[time]] of the [[plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy]], she had survived through over fifty battles and other smaller armed struggles.<ref name=\"Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good\" />\n\nBy time of the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Era|reign]], Ar'alani served as an [[Admiral]] in the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet|Expansionary Defense Fleet]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Batonn insurgency|Battle of Batonn]], [[Commander]] [[Eli N.

Ar'alani allowed the former [[Imperial officer]] to join her [[Starship|ship's]] crew and assigned him to data analysis.<ref name=\"Thrawn Treason\">''[[Thrawn: Treason]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing Thrawn and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] [[Battle of Mokivj|rescue]] [[Battle against Grysk forces|of]] [[Force-sensitive]] Chiss girls from the [[Grysk]]s, Ar'alani informed Thrawn that she would return the children to their families.
