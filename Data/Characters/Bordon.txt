He joined [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Johun Othone]] and [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Irtanna]] aboard the [[Envoy-class shuttle|''Envoy''-class shuttle]] ''[[Star-Wake]]'', on several rescue missions on Ruusan after the detonation of the [[thought bomb]]. Bordon had two sons, [[Tallo (Star-Wake)|Tallo]] and [[Wend]], both of whom also joined him in the rescue effort. His [[Bordon's wife|wife]] had been [[Death/Legends|killed]] by the [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]] in the [[Fourth Battle of Ruusan]], making Bordon angry and hateful of anyone allied with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. On one mission, they found [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Darth Zannah]] wondering around the planet, and believing her to be a war orphan, Bordon offered her a home with him and his two boys, unaware of her allegiance to the Sith. However, she had been tasked by [[Darth Bane/Legends|her master]] to find a way to [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], and she decided to steal the ''Star Wake''. Zannah killed Tallo and disposed of Bordon with two blaster shots to the stomach, before killing the rest of the crew. Bordon's body was later found in the ''Star Wake'' by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Darth Bane: Rule of Two]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Darth Bane: Rule of Two (audiobook)|''Darth Bane: Rule of Two'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bordon\n|es=Bordon\n|pl=Bordon\n|ru=\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Army of Light members]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ruusanians]]"}}}]}}}}
