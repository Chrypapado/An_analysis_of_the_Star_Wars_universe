She [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] at the [[Almas Academy|Almas Jedi Academy]], where she specialized as a [[Jedi Guardian]], and, after participating in the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]], graduated and became a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. A short [[Time/Legends|time]] afterward, D'bis and the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Jedi Consular]] [[Akial]] were sent to represent the Academy at a celebration that was going to be held at [[Greentree Pointe]] resort on [[Dorumaa]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Almas]].\n\n==Biography==\nD'bis was a [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. She became a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and attended the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] that was located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], in the [[Cularin system]]. While there, she [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] to become a [[Jedi Guardian]],<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a combat-orientated [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] specialization.<ref name=\"SWRGRCR\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref> During the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], D'bis undertook the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]], which she passed, making her a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\nA short time after her graduation, D'bis was picked to be an official representative of the Academy at a celebration that was being held on [[Dorumaa]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of Almas. The celebration had been organized by the [[Metatheran Cartel]],<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a [[Merchant/Legends|trade]] organization that was jointly run by members of the [[Caarite]] and [[Filordus]] [[Species/Legends|species]].<ref name=\"LFCG\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref> They had organized the event to thank a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]]<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> for preventing the release of a [[Anti-Caarite virus|deadly virus]] on the [[Caarimon|Caarite homeworld]].<ref name=\"BotB\">''[[Belly of the Beaast]]''</ref>\n\nThe [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Jedi Consular]] [[Akial]] was chosen to accompany D'bis. Due to their different specializations within the Order, D'bis and Akial could represent different approaches to being a Jedi and show that the Order was not single-minded. They traveled from Almas to [[Greentree Pointe]] resort on Dorumaa, where the celebration was being held. Upon their arrival, they set up a booth to try and recruit potential students for the Academy. While at the celebration, D'bis and Akial debated the threat posed by the [[Believers]], a [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] that operated in the Cularin [[Star system/Legends|system]]. They both agreed that the Believers were a major problem for the system but disagreed over how to deal with the cult. D'bis suggested that the Believers should be hunted down, but Akial thought that it would be better to investigate the capabilities of the cult, as little was known about what their goals were. They also discussed the Metatheran Cartel, which had committed many past transgressions in the Cularin system, such as destroying the [[sacred ch'hala tree grove]]. D'bis believed that the Cartel should be regarded with suspicion, due to its secretive nature, although she did not think it was prudent to openly denounce it.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nD'bis was slightly impulsive and liked to speak her mind. Despite this, she generally acted in a patient manner. D'bis also believed that direct aggression could solve the problem posed by the Believers.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nD'bis was created by [[Morrie Mullins (person)|Morrie Mullins]] and made her only appearance in ''[[Paarty On!]]'', a scenario in the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign, a supplement to the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]''. ''Paarty On!'' was an interactive scenario that was intended for use at [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] events, and it outlined how event staff would play the roles of the various non-player characters, such as D'bis, and interact with players of the campaign. The scenario encouraged those playing D'bis and Akial to involve the players in their debate about the Believers and the Cartel, and to also discuss the nature of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] with them.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Paarty On!]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'bis, Krin}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Kel Dor]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
