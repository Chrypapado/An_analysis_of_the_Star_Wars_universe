He and See-Seven examined a trooper of the castle's [[Fortress Vader Imperial garrison|garrison]] that had been exposed to the [[lava fume]]s and became a lunatic. During his questioning, the trooper attacked Vane\u00e9 and warned him not to go inside of the castle. He saw that the trooper was just weak-minded. Vane\u00e9 entered the castle, looked around and searched for<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader\" /> the [[Sith Lord]]<ref name=\"ROASWSN\">[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]</ref> [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].

Although he stated filters could be installed eventually, Vader refused for the time being, and Vane\u00e9 argued against it until the fumes affected him. He saw hallucinations and Vader offered him a position as his [[Aide|attendant]]. Vane\u00e9 heard the hallucinations telling him what Vader needed. Vane\u00e9 tried to convince him that the hallucinations were not real and tried to laugh at them. He laughed for days until his laughter became real.

Vane\u00e9 began to say mercy but was interrupted by the [[Criakan|Mustafarian leader]] who grabbed [[Gender|him]] by his [[robe]] and mocked his pleas of mercy. However with a dark smile, Vane\u00e9 informed the Mustafarian that he was not speaking to him as [[Darth]] Vader appeared behind the Mustafarians with [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]] drawn and proceeded to [[Death|kill]] the invading Mustafarians.<ref name=\"Tales from Vader Castle 5\" />\n\n===Mustafarian plague===\nVane\u00e9 stood on the lower level of an audience chamber within Fortress Vader near [[Emperor's adviser|Imperial advisor]] [[Rersey]] as his master stood on the upper level looking out the room's window with two [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Royal Guards]] standing below. Rersey was demanding an explanation from Vader which angered Vane\u00e9 due to the advisor's lack of respect towards his master. Vane\u00e9 reminded Rersey that he was a guest in his master's residence and would act accordingly which Rersey rebuffed. Vader halted the pair's squabbling as he felt a disturbance in the force moments before a chilling scream echoed in the chamber, startling all but Vader.<ref name=\"Return to Vader's Castle 5\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 5|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 5]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pseudo-infected_Vader.png|thumb|left|150px|Vader pretended to be mind-controlled]]\nVane\u00e9 along with Rersey followed Vader and the two guards as they went to investigate the source of the scream. Rersey remarked how the fortress was supposed to be secured to which Vane\u00e9 quietly suggested that Rersey secure his own mouth. When Rersey asked what he had said, Vane\u00e9 drearily replied he had said nothing right before loud heavy booming sound echoed through the corridor. Arriving at the fortress' entrance, Rersey demanded to know what was going on to which Vane\u00e9 answered that the castle was under attack as a horde of [[Unidentified plague (Mustafar)|plagued]] infested Mustafarians and a [[lava flea]] broke through the doors. Vane\u00e9 looked on in shock as his master and the guards engaged the rampaging horde which included an infected [[Lava Trooper]]. After Vader had bitten by the infected trooper, Vane\u00e9 cried out in horror to Rersey that they had to escape only to look on in horror, clenching to Rersey as the horde and Vader slowly advanced on them until he was halted by [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Sssl]] of [[Clan Rrrt]].<ref name=\"Return to Vader's Castle 5\" />\n\nAs Rersey confronted Sssl, Vane\u00e9 cautiously advise him to be careful as she controlled the infected. After the advisor snidely asked Sssl what secrets she was protecting, Vane\u00e9 pointed out to Rersey that Sssl would not be telling them what secrets she was protecting. Vane\u00e9 and Rersey recoiled in fear as Sssl commanded Vader to kill the both of them as Vane\u00e9 cried out in fear. Rersey then shoved Vane\u00e9 to the floor between him and Vader as he told the Dark Lord he needed to resist Sssl's power over him. As Vader advanced towards them, Vane\u00e9 cowered in fear on the floor until the Dark Lord revealed he was not under Sssl's power by levitating her off the ground.<ref name=\"Return to Vader's Castle 5\" />\n\n[[File:IntoTheLava.png|thumb|right|200px|Vane\u00e9 and Rersey]]\nGetting up off the ground, Vane\u00e9 revealed to Sssl that it had all been a trap to lure her into attacking the castle. As Sssl struggled in Vader's grip, Vane\u00e9 gleefully told her that she was no match for his master's ingenuity and power. Vane\u00e9 watched as Vader willed Sssl to order her horde to drag her into the [[Magma|lava]] and followed his master and Rersey outside as they watched Sssl and her infected horde burn in the lava. Once the ordeal was over with Vane\u00e9 congratulated his master, stating how all Mustafarians would tremble at the very mention of his name. Vader  informed Vane\u00e9 that it was of no importance before telling Advisor Rersey that his [[Theta-class T-2c shuttle|shuttle]] was waiting for him to take him back to the Emperor. Vane\u00e9 looked on Rersey with an expression of exasperation as the traumatized advisor continually recounted the sight of Mother Sssl being dragged into the lava.<ref name=\"Return to Vader's Castle 5\" />\n\n===Krennic's visit===\n{{Quote|My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.|Vane\u00e9, to Darth Vader|audio=KrennicArrived.ogg|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}\nVane\u00e9 was present on the landing pad of the castle when [[Director]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]] disembarked [[ST 149|his shuttle]] after arriving on Mustafar<ref name=\"ROASWSN\" /> in [[0 BBY]].<ref name=\"Date\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'', which includes [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]]'s visit to [[Mustafar]] to [[0 BBY]]</ref> Without a word, Vane\u00e9 led Krennic into the castle and took him deep into the facility until they had arrived in a rotunda that looked out onto Mustafar's landscape. He motioned for the Director to wait,<ref name=\"ROASWSN\" /> which irritated Krennic,<ref name=\"RO Junior\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> before he proceeded to leave via a door on the other side of the chamber.<ref name=\"ROASWSN\" />\n\n[[File:VaderBactaTank-RogueOne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vane\u00e9, approaching Vader's private chamber]]\nVane\u00e9 made his way to Vader's private rejuvenation chamber and entered, passing through the chamber's two sets of security doors. Approaching the [[bacta tank]] centered in the middle of the chamber, Vane\u00e9 knelt with his head bowed. As he stated that Krennic had arrived at the castle, Vane\u00e9 looked up directly to the tank to see Vader's form emerge from within the [[bacta]]. Vane\u00e9 bowed his head as the tank started to drain.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\n[[File:Krennic_Leaving_Mustafar.png|thumb|right|250px|Krennic leaving Mustafar]]\nMoments later, Vane\u00e9 returned to the rotunda and made his way past Krennic without speaking anything to him which was hardly noticed at all by Krennic. He then disappeared into the corridor. After Vader's meeting with Krennic had come to an end, Vane\u00e9 met Krennic as the man stumbled out from the rotunda. Silently tipping his head, he motioned for the Director to follow him as he led Krennic back down the same path they had taken before. After a few moments as they walked, Vane\u00e9 spoke for the first time, telling Krennic that he was one of the few individuals who had had the honor of seeing Vader in his sanctum. Upon reaching the door of the landing pad, Vane\u00e9 advised that the Director tell nobody about what he saw.<ref name=\"ROASWSN\" />\n\n===Rebels in the fortress ===\n[[File:Vanee-G3.png|thumb|left|175px|Vane\u00e9 is discovered by XM-G3]]\nVane\u00e9, who protected Fortress Vader from prying eyes,<ref name=\"USWNE\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref> was in an upper floor control room informing Vader via [[comlink]] that [[spy droid]]s had detected [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebel]] [[Lina Graf's crew|forces]] within the castle when [[XM-G3|Gee-Three]] and [[Skritt]] came upon him. Fearful when he saw Gee-Three aiming at him, Vane\u00e9 quickly alerted his master that the rebels had found him. After Gee-Three demanded to know what the Empire was doing on [[Mustafar]], Vane\u00e9 merely chuckled and replied he would like to see him try to shoot him just before the [[droid]] was lifted off the floor. Vane\u00e9 laughed after Gee-Three asked he was lifting him and responded that it was his master's doing. With a sadistic smile, Vane\u00e9 watched as Gee-Three was ripped apart and fell to the floor in pieces.<ref name=\"Tales from Vader Castle 4\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 4|''Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle'' 4]]</ref>\n\nMoments later, Vane\u00e9, wielding an [[ax]], confronted rebel [[Commander]] [[Lina Graf]] and Skritt in one of the castle's corridors after the pair had been surrounded by the castle's [[security droid]]s. He asked Graf if she was sure [[Ghost (folklore)|ghosts]] did not exist as he ominously claimed that the lost souls of his master's victims roam the castle's hallways included that of their comrade, the [[thief]]. After Graf identified the supposed thief as their colleague [[Thom Hudd]], Vane\u00e9 revealed that Hudd had paid the price for trying to take something that was not his and he had not been the first to meet that fate. Vane\u00e9 then told Graf and Skritt the story of the first Mustafarian raid on the fortress and how the forces where eventually slaughtered by his master. Even after Vane\u00e9 told the rebels such would be their fate, Graf replied that he did not frighten them as she pulled her [[blaster]] on him, stating she had faced real monsters. Vane\u00e9 informed Graf that she would know fear as he introduced her to his master, Darth Vader who had appeared behind her. Vane\u00e9 smiled as he watched Vader deflect Graf's blaster shot and hurled the bisected torso of her droid [[CR-8R|Crater]] at her.<ref name=\"Tales from Vader Castle 5\" />\n\n[[File:VaneeFool.png|thumb|right|200px|Vane\u00e9 is knocked into Vader]]\nThe Sith Lord approached Vane\u00e9 and voiced his disappointed in his [[Aide|attendant]] by chiding his fear of the rebels. Cowering, Vane\u00e9 replied how the rebels had tried to steal Vader's treasures after breaking into the castle. Vane\u00e9 watched as his master used [[the Force]] to [[Telekinesis|lift]] Graf but was suddenly shoved by Crater, knocking him against Vader, allowing the rebels a chance to escape. A short [[time]] later, Vane\u00e9 informed Vader that the castle was under attack by an [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST]] which Skritt had commandeered.<ref name=\"Tales from Vader Castle 5\" />\n\n===Torturous storyteller and imprisonment===\nVane\u00e9 leered before [[Lieutenant]] Hudd, who was restrained by shackles upright. Holding an ax, the servant expressed his glee that Hudd had regained conscious and remarked on his stamina to resist pain unlike previous prisoners. Asking Hudd if he knew why he was restrained, Vane\u00e9 stated how he was looking forward to what was in store for the captured rebel. Vane\u00e9 went on to explain that he knew how others thought of him but that he did not care; he lived to serve his master and he had his stories. Pressing a button on a nearby control panel, Vane\u00e9 projected five distorted [[hologram]]s of frightening figures including one of his master and stated that he knew stories that were true nightmares. With dark glee, the servant asked Hudd if he would like to hear one of his stories and proceeded to tell him the tale of [[Maul|the horned devil]] on the planet of [[Lotho Minor]]. As he finished his tale, Vane\u00e9 commented on the nature of greed as he deactivated the hologram and concluded how it never ended well before pointing an accusing figure at the restrained Lieutenant Hudd, who knew this as he tried to steal from his master.<ref name=\"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 1\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 1|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Torture_web.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thom Hudd being shocked by a torture web]]\nWith sadistic joy, Vane\u00e9 watched as Hudd continued to be shocked within the [[torture web]]. Turning the device off, Vane\u00e9 thanked the captured rebel for being able to inform his master that the torture web was still operational before subjecting Hudd to another round of electric torture. Vane\u00e9's habit of telling nightmarish stories made Hudd recall a story told to him by Commander [[Cremp]]. Hearing Hudd speak quietly to himself after recalling the tale, Vane\u00e9 asked him if he had anything to say. Receiving no answer, Vane\u00e9 activated the torture web but heard no reaction from the captured rebel. Turing, Vane\u00e9 was shocked to see Hudd had escaped from his shackles. Vane\u00e9 then took after Hudd, promising the lieutenant that he could not hide from him and would experience new levels of pain.<ref name=\"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 2\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 2|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 2]]</ref>\n\nWith ax in hand, Vane\u00e9 made his way down a corridor where Hudd was hiding behind a curtain. Hearing the man behind the curtain, Vane\u00e9 sliced through it, causing Hudd to emerge from hiding. Hudd the threw the curtain at Vane\u00e9 as a distraction, giving him time to make a run for it. After pulling the curtain off, Vane\u00e9 stood motionless and informed Hudd that he was fooling himself trying to escape and how he would never give up hunting him. Stalking down the hall, Vane\u00e9 told Hudd that the lieutenant's suggestions of hobbies made him laugh but that one's nature did not allow them to change. This prompted Vane\u00e9 to ask Hudd if he had told him the tale of [[Asajj Ventress|the assassin who became a bounty hunter]] as he continued his hunt. As he finished his tale, Vane\u00e9 concluded that the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] always wins in the end just as he came upon Hudd in a control room trying to find a way out of the castle, who accidentally activated two [[Imperial training droid]]s.<ref name=\"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 3\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 3|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Inquisitor_and_Vanee.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lina Graf impersonating an inquisitor]]\nVane\u00e9 commanded that the [[droid]]s stop attacking Hudd, as Vane\u00e9 considered it his job to hurt Hudd. While Vane\u00e9 brought Hudd back to the torture web, Hudd told Vane\u00e9 about the story of the [[Hutt]] [[Crakka]]. Vane\u00e9 expressed boredom upon hearing the story, and said that he wanted to hear Hudd scream. While Hudd pleaded, Vane\u00e9 was interrupted by Lina Graf, who was impersonating<ref name=\"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 4\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 4|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 4]]</ref> the [[inquisitor]]<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{EncyclopediaCite|Darth Maul and Other Dark Side Followers}}</ref> the [[Fourth Sister]], who claimed that [[Darth Sidious|the Emperor]] wanted Hudd transported to [[Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 4\" />\n\nVane\u00e9 shouted that the [[Inquisitorius]] had no authority over Fortress Vader, attacking Graf with his axe. Graf defended herself with her [[force pike]], claiming that the [[emperor]]'s elite have authority everywhere. Graf easily disarmed Vane\u00e9, referring to him as a mere servant. He responded by suggesting that they were all servants of the [[Galactic Empire]], and told Graf about Rersey's visit [[Standard year|years]] prior. He then knocked Graf into the torture web with his axe, electrocuting her and revealing who she really was. Graf asked how Vane\u00e9 knew she was a fake, to which Vane\u00e9 responded by pointing out that Graf didn't have a lightsaber. As the two of them dueled, Hudd reactivated Vane\u00e9's distorted holograms, distracting Vane\u00e9 long enough for them to escape in a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]]. Despite not wanting for his master to find out about what happened, Vader was angered by Vane\u00e9's failure and attached him to the torture web,<ref name=\"Return to Vader's Castle 5\" /> before locking him in a pit in the bowels of the castle.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader\" />\n\n=== Escape===\n{{Quote|The Dark Lord.

Vane\u00e9, pretending to be a poor old man, convinced Giggek to help him. He expressed surprise upon finding out that Vader had died, and told the mustafarians about [[Restin]]'s attempted assassination on Vader. As the Mustafarian reached down for his hand, Vane\u00e9 pulled him down the pit and climbed up to take care of Tuttel. Giggek, however, was still alive and told his friend to run away as far as possible and tell everybody of what they did before detonating the bombs, blowing up the bottom of the castle. Vane\u00e9 escaped the explosion, and as he limped from the fire, a voice came to him that sounded like Vader's. Asking who he was, the apparent ghost of Vader told Vane\u00e9 that he knew him and was the same voice who was speaking to him at the bottom of the pit. The voice told Vane\u00e9 that Vader would come back to life out of the lava river and become more powerful than ever before.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader\" />\n\n=== Serving Ghost Vader===\n{{Quote|They say that you are dead master.

Vane\u00e9 then called upon the [[Immortal gods of the Sith|Immortal Gods of the Sith]] to summon vengeance on everyone in and imprinted illusion nightmares on everyone across the galaxy. A dream was planted on the mind of [[Milo Graf]], who had a dream of a bunch of zombified droids. After explaining the dream to [[CR-8R|Crater]], he told him he would never think of him that same way.

He was insane due to breathing in the lava fumes. He was also rather sadistic taking delight in the pain of others. He was also quite content with being Vader's servant, as he himself claimed.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVane\u00e9 was played by British actor [[Martin Gordon]] in the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''. He was scripted as appearing in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' [[Star Wars Rebels Season Four|Season Four]], but as the story concept evolved he was replaced with [[Veris Hydan]].\n\nA [[Unidentified Sith assistant|character]] similar in appearance to Vane\u00e9 appears in [[Darth Vader (2017) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 8]], informing Vader on [[Coruscant]] that the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] had discovered evidence of a [[Jocasta Nu|Jedi Knight]] in [[Galactic City]].<ref name=\"Dark Lord 8\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 8]]</ref> According to a story told by Lellis in ''[[Star Wars Adventures: Shadow of Vader's Castle]]'', however, Vane\u00e9 did not begin serving Vader until after the [[Battle of Fortress Vader|construction]] of Fortress Vader, meaning that the servant in ''Dark Lord of the Sith'' 8 cannot be him.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader\" /> \n\n==='''Non-canon appearances'''===\n{{Quote|Master is gone, the ''Emperor'' is gone&hellip;finally, the galaxy shall fear ''me!|Vane\u00e9|LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales}}\nIn the non-canon animated special ''[[LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales]],'' Vane\u00e9 appeared as the main antagonist and was voiced by [[Tony Hale]]. In the beginning of the episode, Vane\u00e9 surprised and scared [[Darth Sidious|Emperor Palpatine]] with a crackle of lightning. Vader`s servant tells him that his \"bath\" (Bacta Tank), was ready for him as he handed Vader a rubber duckie. Palpatine told Vader that they have more important things to do, and told Vane\u00e9 to look over the castle, in which he took delight in the job as he cackled. In contrast to Canon, Vane\u00e9 still served at Vader`s fortress, which was still standing in [[35 ABY]]. [[Resistance]] pilot [[Poe Dameron]] and droid [[BB-8]] crash landed on Mustafar, in which they ended up in Castle Vader. [[Graballa/LEGO|Graballa the Hutt]] was making a hotel in the castle and set up a lava fountain on the entrance on the castle. Vane\u00e9`s protocol droid assistant [[NI-L8]] informed him about the arrival of Poe, in which Vane\u00e9 replied that he might be the one to fulfill the Prophecy of Mustafar, in which a fearless pilot would enter with the strength to unlock the treasures of Fortress Vader. Poe and a boy named [[Dean (mechanic)|Dean]] were about to leave the castle, but were blocked by Vane\u00e9 and his droid NI-L8, though was acting friendly. Graballa warns Vane\u00e9 not to sneak up on people, and apologizes for  the servant that he is the \"creepy caretaker of the castle. Vane\u00e9  began to sniff Poe, and told him that he has something show the Resistance pilot. Dameron explained to Vane\u00e9 that he is on a rush, but Vane\u00e9 had NI-L8 show him the helmet of [[Ren]], the former leader of the [[Knights of Ren]] before [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] rose to power, who was responsible for the creation of Kylo, which made Poe interested and asked Poe if he would like to hear its tale, in which Graballa reminded him that Dameron was in a hurry, but Poe got interested and asked Vane\u00e9 to tell him of it`s tale, in which Vane\u00e9 replied that it was the story of a boy who longed for more. After finishing the story, Poe Dameron asks if the story was meant to scare him. Vane\u00e9 tells him that the story was to remind him that there is much to be taken by those unafraid to use it. He hands the helmet back to NI-L8. Vane\u00e9 began to lead his guests to a large door, claiming that Sith artifacts lie behind it. He says that the Prophecy of Mustafar foretells the arrival of a fearless stranger with the strength to open it. The gate is marked with the symbol of the [[Galactic Empire|Old Empire]]. Vane\u00e9 suggests that a brave pilot who has fought many battles is worth of opening the gate. When Dean reminds Poe about the X-wing, Poe says that if Vane\u00e9 is telling the truth, he is not willing to let a [[Hutt]] get his hands on Sith artifacts.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\">''[[LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales]]''</ref>\n\nPoe enlists Dean's help in unlocking the gate. Vane\u00e9 leads them into the chamber. Baash and Raam are spooked by a shadow which turns out to be a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]]. Graballa tells his  [[Iktotchi]] minions [[Raam]]  and [[Baash]] that they could add a business center and gym to these vast chambers. Meanwhile, Poe chats with Dean about the latter's ambitions to be a pilot. When Poe asks how Dean ended up working for Graballa, Dean explains that he is saving for his family. His mother had a shop on [[Arkanis]]. However, the [[First Order]] accused her of helping the Resistance and destroyed it. People got scared and wouldn't hire her anymore, leaving him as the breadwinner. Dean fears that if he loses this job, his family will have nothing.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nPoe comforts Dean, telling the boy that he had a tough childhood. He adds that it is a big galaxy and that you can't let fear get to you. They are surprised by Graballa, who is obsessed with turning the chamber into luxury suites.  Vane\u00e9 leads his guests into the lightsaber repository, telling them that they are looking for something very special. He finds the Saber of Scardont, which he describes as a Sith lightsaber of unusual power. To Vane\u00e9's horror, Graballa toys with it and breaks the hilt. Graballa demands for Dean to fix it but Poe reminds Dean that it is a Sith lightsaber, but Dean responds that he must keep his job. While Dean works on the damaged Saber, Vane\u00e9 asks if they are interested in hearing the Tale of the Saber of Scardont. Poe is not surprised about what Vane\u00e9 has to offer. Vane\u00e9 claims that it is a tale of two monstrosities, (which were actually [[Maul|Darth Maul]] and [[Grievous|General Grievous]]), leading to the cackling of lightning inside the chamber, which startled Baash, and Raam, and startled Poe as well. After finishing the tale Dean finished fixing the Lightsaber, but is interested in the Dark Side artifact. Vane\u00e9 explains that Maul learnt that power comes not from serving others but from serving yourself. Dean appears to get the message and Vane\u00e9 tells him to follow where the saber leads him. Dean uses the Saber of Scardont to unlock a second chamber. Vane\u00e9 suggests to NI-L8 that he placed his hopes on the wrong pilot, to which the droid agrees.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nThe possessed Dean leads the others to the first Temple of Mustafar. Poe says he has a bad feeling about this but BB-8 rolls in. Vane\u00e9 explains that the Temple of Mustafar was built generations ago as as a repository of ancient lore. The temple is littered with treasure. Graballa tells Baash and Raam to pack it up. Graballa grabs the Saber of Scardont, claiming it as the property of \"Graballa the Hutt Enterprises, LLC.\" Poe tells Graballa that they need to talk but the Hutt thinks that he doesn't need a spokesman anymore with all the Sith treasure they have found.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nPoe tries to warn about the danger of the Sith treasure but Graballa is only concerned about making money. Dean hears Maul's voice calling out to him from a [[Sith holocron]] inside a pillar, telling him to seize the power to free his mother. Vane\u00e9 is pleased that Dean has found the holocron. He tells Dean that this holocron has the power to make any dream come true. Graballa is dismissive about the holocron having the power to grant wishes. Dean says that a [[Wookiee]]'s paw can do that.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nVane\u00e9 surmises that the child is aware of the Wookiee's Paw. Dean explains that the pilots who came to his mother's shop would tell stories. Poe says that he heard those stories but thinks they are are made up. Addressing Dean, Vane\u00e9 tells them the tale of a boy searching for a better life, much like him. After explaining the story, Dean asks if that is really what happened. Poe says this is not true, prompting Graballa to asks if he means that [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] did not blow up the [[Death Star]]. Poe says that Luke destroyed the Death Star but not in the way that Vane\u00e9 told the story. Vane\u00e9 says that just as the Wookiee's paw gave Skywalker all that he wanted, he claims that the holocron will give him what he desires. Poe warns Dean that story is a warning about being careful for what he wishes for.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nVane\u00e9 tells Dean that he understands that the boy wants his family to be safe. He tells the boy to open it and he won't have to worry about them again. Poe tries to plead with Dean but he is accosted by NI-L8. Vane\u00e9 tells Dean to open the holocron with his heart. The boy unlocks the holocron but nothing happens. When Dean confronts Vane\u00e9, the Sith servant reveals that it makes his dreams come true before snatching it out of the boy's hand. Vane\u00e9 reveals that his plan was to manipulate Dean into unlocking the holocron and tells the boy that he is strong with the Force.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nVane\u00e9 uses the holocron to summon the various objects in the Sith chamber including Ren's mask and the Saber of Scardont to form a giant armored suit. Poe, Dean and BB-8 realize that the three stories that Vane\u00e9 told were for himself. Vane\u00e9 vows to make the galaxy fear him. When Poe asks him and what army, NI-L8 arms herself. Poe is dimissive of the droid but NI-N8 activates an army of [[B1-series battle droid|B1-series battle droids]]. Vane\u00e9 orders NI-L8 and her droids to annihilate his enemies. Poe decides to fight back and tells Dean that they have to remove Vane\u00e9's holocron from his armor. Poe shoots the holocron off Vane\u00e9's armor and flees with Dean and BB-8. Vane\u00e9 order NI-L8 to recover the holocron since his power is dependent on it. He orders his droid army to get them. Vane\u00e9  eventually caught up to Dean and Poe down the hallway, and beheads the Darth Vader puppet, which says that he \"finds his lack of souvenirs disturbing.\"  As Dean and Poe were running down the Iron Tree forest, Poe was determined to escape offworld with the Sith holocron. Dean blames himself for fixing the lightsaber and opening the holocron because he was scared. Poe reassures him that everyone gets scared. Dean says that Poe doesn't but the fighter pilot disagrees, admitting he is scared. He tells Dean that they can't control fear but they can choose what to do with it. He says that without fear, they can't have courage. BB-8 warns that the battle droids are approaching their X-wing.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nBB-8 loses his grapping cable to swing himself around the rampaging battle droids, knocking several out. Poe and Dean climb into the starfighter only to discover the X-wing hasn't been repaired. While Poe grumbles, Dean volunteers to repair the starship. Poe decides to buy Dean time to fix the starfighter. He returns to Castle Vader where Vane\u00e9 is growing enraged by the loss of the holocron. Poe attacks Vane\u00e9's battle droids with a parked [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walker]]. Graballa, Baash and Raam cower while Poe's AT-ST engages with NI-L8's [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walker]], pushing it to the edge of the walkway.<ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nVane\u00e9 attacks Poe's walker from behind, slicing off one of its joints. Both walkers fall over the edge into the lava below, where they are destroyed. Poe survives and climbs to the top only to be confronted by battle droids. Dean arrives in Poe's X-wing and strafes the battle droids. He lands the starfighter nearby. Vowing to rule the galaxy, Vane\u00e9 grabs Poe with his metallic body. He threatens to throw Poe into the lava below unless Dean gives him the holocron. Poe tells Dean to fly away since Vane\u00e9 is getting weaker in his armored body. As Vane\u00e9 threatened to throw Poe over the edge. Dean considers the ultimatum but recalls the moral of the story of the Wookiee's paw, which is be careful for what you wish for. He throws the holocron over the edge of the walkway into the lava below. Vane\u00e9 jumps after the holocron and is consumed by the lava, seemingly killing him. However, this was not the end for Vane\u00e9, as NI-L8 was dragging herself out of the lava, she expressed regret that she failed him, in which Vane\u00e9 responds by gripping on to her hand out of the lava, laughing. <ref name=\"Terrifying Tales\" />\n\nTony Hale truly inhabited his role with abandon. During recordings, Hale physicalized what Vane\u00e9 was doing, and this informed much of the way Vane\u00e9 was approached in animation. The producers purposely had Vane\u00e9 tell stories spanning all eras of ''[[Star Wars]]'' so that there would be something for everyone to enjoy.<ref name=\"Ghoulactic Event\">{{SW|url=news/lego-star-wars-terrifying-tales-interview|text=The Creators of ''LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales'' on Crafting a Ghoulactic Halloween Event|archivedate=20211001142418}}</ref> Vane\u00e9 introduces the story \"The Wookiee's Paw\" by saying \u201cSubmitted for your approval,\u201d referencing an iconic line from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone The Twilight Zone].
