Early in its history, Kaadara was unique among Naboo cities because the local populace welcomed, and even encouraged, interactions with the native [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]]. Kaadara's first [[Regent/Legends|regent]], Kallos Sook, actually hired a large contingent of Gungans to serve as the city's [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|security force]]. However, in the [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] following Sook's regency, the increased presence of outsiders led the suspicious Gungans to abandon their role as protectors of Kaadara. The [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]] then went on to install a small [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] of [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Force]] [[Officer/Legends|officers]] in their stead.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKallos Sook was first mentioned in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"AED\" /><ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Sook was briefly mentioned in the description overview for [[W:c:swg:Kaadara|Kaadara]], a [[W:c:swg:City|city]] on the [[W:c:swg:Planet|planet]] [[W:c:swg:Naboo|Naboo]].<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sook, Kallos}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"}}}]}}}}
