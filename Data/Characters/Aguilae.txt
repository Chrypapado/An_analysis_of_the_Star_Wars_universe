Aguilae held the title of manager of the [[Jawa Traders]], a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] store in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] which was clearly favored by [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] and [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]].<ref name=\"GG7\" />\n\n==Biography==\nAt some point, [[Squib/Legends|Squib]] [[Macemillian-winduart\u00e9]] got indebted with Aguilae. Noticing that she could not manage the store by herself, Aguilae agreed to forget Macemillian-winduart\u00e9's debt if he accepted a job with her.\n\nMacemillian-winduart\u00e9 bought accounting [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[CZ-3/Legends|CZ-3]], which was being searched by both criminal businessman [[Opun Mcgrrrr|Opun \"Black Hole\" Mcgrrrr]] and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Aguilae quickly sold the droid to [[Het Nkik/Legends|Het Nkik's]] tribe, before Mcgrrr could find it on her store.\n\nHowever, Aguilae and Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 then tried to buy it again, and looked for the [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]] of the customers. When they reached the sandcrawler, CZ-3 was no longer there. However, that sandcrawler suddenly was under attack of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. Aguilae and Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 barely escaped with their lives.\n\nLater, Aguilae found CZ-3, but the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Zutton/Legends|Zutton]] had destroyed it prior to discovery. Aguilae took the droid's motivator and some other parts.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|11|Spare Parts (short story)|Spare Parts}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=There's Many a Slip Betwixt Cup and Lip}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{GamerCite|3|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Jawas}}\n*{{FFCite|60|AST11, ''R5-D4 Astromech Droid''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|aguilae|Aguilae|archivedate=20100209160210}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jawas]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
