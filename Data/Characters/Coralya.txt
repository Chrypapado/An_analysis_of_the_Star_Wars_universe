During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], she was chosen as a chief and representative by her colleagues at the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] lair of [[Providence]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCoralya had a strong will and sense of command, and was able to impose herself on the brutal and bawdy men of the station. She would always enforce her rights, which earned her respect but also garnered hatred by those who didn't receive her favors or challenged her.\n\nFew would stand before her, and her authority was undisputed in the [[Arcades (Providence)|arcades]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCoralya was created by [[Jean-Michel Ringuet]] for the ambiguously [[canon]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] aid \"[[Providence (Avalon)|Providence]],\" which appeared in the French magazine ''[[Avalon 1]]''. She was illustrated by [[Jean-Marc Emy]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Avalonmag|1|Providence (Avalon)|Providence}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Prostitutes]]"}}}]}}}}
