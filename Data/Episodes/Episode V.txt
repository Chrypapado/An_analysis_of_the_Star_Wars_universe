It is the second part of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].\n\nThe film concerns the continuing struggles of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] against the [[Galactic Empire]]. During the film, [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] are being pursued across space by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and his elite forces. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] begins his major [[Jedi]] training with [[Yoda]], after an instruction from [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s [[Force spirit|spirit]]. In an emotional and near-fatal [[Duel on Cloud City|confrontation]] with Vader, Luke is presented with a horrific revelation and must face his destiny.\n\nThough controversial upon release, the film has proved to be the most popular film in the series among fans and critics and is now widely regarded as one of the best sequel films of all time, as well as one of the greatest films of all time. It was [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|re-released with changes]] in [[1997]] and on DVD in [[2004]]. The film was re-released on Blu-ray format in [[September]] of [[2011]]. A [[Star Wars (radio)|radio adaptation]] was broadcast on National Public Radio in the U.S.A. in 1983. The film was selected in 2010 to be preserved by the [[Wikipedia:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] as part of its [[Wikipedia:National Film Registry|National Film Registry]].\n\n==Opening crawl==\n{{Opening crawl\n|name=Episode V<br />THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\n|text=It is a dark time for the\nRebellion.

I want proof, not leads!|[[Admiral]] [[Kendal Ozzel]]|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\nIt is now three years after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]. The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] has been forced to [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|flee]] its [[Great Temple|base]] on [[Yavin 4]] and establish a new one on the ice planet of [[Hoth]].\n\nAn [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]], dispatched by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], continuing his quest for [[Luke Skywalker]], launches thousands of [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] across the galaxy, [[XJ9-CS14|one]] of which lands on Hoth and begins its survey of the planet. Luke Skywalker, on patrol astride his [[tauntaun]], discovers the probe, which he mistakes for a meteorite. After reporting to comrade [[Han Solo]] that he'll investigate the site, Luke is knocked unconscious by a deadly [[wampa]].\n\nWhen Luke fails to report in at [[Echo Base]], Han Solo goes out on his tauntaun to search for him in an encroaching storm. Upon waking up, Luke finds himself hanging upside down in a cave; his eyes opening to the sight of a wampa eating his tauntaun. Using the power of [[the Force]], Luke is able to pull his [[lightsaber]] out of the snow and towards himself. After he ignites it, he cuts himself free and cuts off the attacking wampa's arm just in time, running out of the cave and escaping into the cold night of Hoth.\n\nLuke tries to make his way to Echo Base on foot, but he finds himself lost in the blizzard and collapses in the snow. Suddenly, he sees the [[Force spirit]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] appear before him. Luke then goes to [[Dagobah]] to undergo training under [[Yoda]], a [[Grand Master|Jedi Grand Master]]. After the spirit ghost disappears, Han arrives to find an almost unconscious Luke, who is mumbling indistinctly about Obi-Wan, Yoda and Dagobah. At this point, the tauntaun that Han was riding on collapses in the extreme cold. To keep Luke from freezing to death during the blizzard, Han uses Luke's lightsaber to cut open the dead tauntaun and places Luke in it. Han then sets about erecting a shelter that he and Luke will stay in during the night. They are forced to stay out during the night as the aircraft ([[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeders]]) that the Rebels use for atmospheric flight had not yet been adapted for the extremely low temperatures of the Hoth night and are therefore unable to mount a rescue operation to retrieve Han and Luke.\n\nThe next morning, Rebel Pilots flying the snowspeeders set out from Echo Base to search for the missing men. [[Zev Senesca]], one of the pilots in [[Rogue Squadron|Rogue Group]], makes contact with Han over comlink and the pair are rescued. When they are taken back to base, Luke is put in a [[bacta tank]] for healing under the care of medical droid, [[2-1B]].\n\n[[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] tries to urge Han to stay with the rebels, and when Han assumes it is because she has feelings for him, Leia loses her temper and calls him a \"stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the probe droid has spotted signs that indicate Hoth is occupied and sends a signal to the Imperial fleet, shortly before being shot at by Han Solo and [[Chewbacca]] and triggering its self-destruct mechanism. Aboard the ''[[Executor]]'', Admiral [[Kendal Ozzel]] dismisses the information as evidence of smugglers, nothing more. However, [[Darth]] Vader knows better and orders the fleet to Hoth. Han warns [[General]] [[Carlist Rieekan|Rieekan]] that the Empire is probably aware of their location, and Rieekan orders the evacuation of Echo Base to begin.\n\n===The Battle of Hoth===\n[[File:Atathoth.jpg|thumb|left|[[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]] on [[Hoth]].]]\nDarth Vader and the Imperial forces set course for the Hoth system to set up the attack. The rebels load whatever equipment they can onto transports and plan a rear-guard action to secure their escape. Luke, now fully recovered from the Wampa attack and subsequent exposure, says farewell to Chewbacca and Solo, who have decided to leave the Alliance to resolve their debt to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]]. As the Imperial forces enter the Hoth system, General Rieekan orders full power to the energy shield that is protecting the base from orbital bombardment.\n\nAboard the ''[[Executor]]'', [[General]] [[Maximilian Veers]] notifies Vader that Admiral Ozzel has emerged from lightspeed too close to Hoth. Ozzel intended to catch the Rebels unaware before they could set up their defenses. However, Vader realizes that the Rebels have been alerted to the fleet's arrival. Via video communication, Vader [[Force choke]]s Ozzel to death for his incompetence, then appoints [[Captain]] [[Firmus Piett]] the new Admiral on the spot. As Vader previously ordered, the Imperial ground forces, commanded by General Veers, land outside the Rebels' shield and march overland to destroy the power generator.\n\nPrincess Leia gives the Rebel fighters instructions on the evacuation to leave Hoth two to three ships at a time past the energy shield to a rendezvous point, which is beyond the outer rim. Rieekan lowers the shields to fire the Ion cannon at one of the Imperial Star Destroyers allowing the first transports to escape. The Rebel pilots assigned to hold off the Imperial ground assault depart the Hoth base for the oncoming [[Battle of Hoth|battle]] against heavily equipped Imperial forces, who are armed with agile [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-STs]] (All Terrain Scout Transports) and monstrous [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]] (All Terrain Armored Transport) walkers, led by General Veers.\n\nThe [[Rogue Squadron]] snowspeeder group led by Luke commences the attack. Luke quickly realizes the AT-AT's armor is far too strong for blasters and decides to use attached harpoons and tow cables to tangle the walker's legs. Luke's gunner [[Dak Ralter]] is hit and killed during the first approach. This leaves [[Wedge Antilles]] and his gunner [[Wes Janson]] to make the first pass. They manage to topple one of the AT-ATs, which is destroyed as Rebel troops storm it. The main AT-AT, commanded by General Veers, prepares to take their aim at the Rebel base's main power generator. Suddenly, Luke's speeder is shot down by the Imperials, and crash-lands in the snow. Luke escapes before an AT-AT can step on and crush his ship.\n\nThe Rebel base is now under direct attack and Imperial snowtroopers have entered the base, forcing Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and [[C-3PO]] to escape. Leia gives the evacuation command for the base as they leave.\n\n[[File:Rebels_get_pounded.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebels]]' desperate fight.]]\nLuke, meanwhile, manages to destroy another AT-AT by using his hoist cable and lightsaber to get into the belly of the transport, tossing in a thermal detonator, and then detaching himself from the cable as a series of explosions neutralize the AT-AT. The Rebels suffer major casualties as the result of the battle. The main AT-AT, being driven by General Veers, gets within firing range of the power generator, then successfully blasts and destroys it.\n\nHan, Leia, and company, now realizing they are being followed by Vader (who has arrived personally on Hoth), make their way to the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in time to escape. As the ''Falcon'' flies off, Luke reaches [[R2-D2]] and his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighter]] and finally departs Hoth. Changing course from the rendezvous point, he sets his coordinates for Dagobah.\n\nHan and company are pursued by Imperial [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Flipping the switch to take them to lightspeed, Han realizes (with reluctant help from 3PO) that the hyperdrive has been damaged. While trying to fix the hyperdrive system, Han enters an [[asteroid]] field to hamper pursuit. He manages to land his ship inside a cavern on one of the larger asteroids to rest and find a way to fix the ship.\n\n===The way of a Jedi===\n[[File:Hanleiafalcon.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Han Solo]] and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia]] kissing.]]\nLuke lands on the marshy [[planet]] Dagobah, swamping his X-wing in the process. There, he discovers a diminutive and eccentric figure who fiddles around with Luke's gear. After Luke tells him that he is looking for a [[Jedi Master]], the being offers to take Luke to Yoda.\n\nBack on the ''Falcon'', while Leia tries to make repairs, Han makes his move on the Princess, drawing himself closer to her before both end up in a passionate kiss. When Threepio arrives, Leia withdraws and walks away.\n\nVader orders the entirety of [[Death Squadron]] to begin sweeping the asteroid field to find the ''Millennium Falcon'' As the search continues, the dangers of the field begin to take their toll: an asteroid smashes into the bridge tower of a [[Star Destroyer]], presumably killing all aboard. On the ''Executor'', Vader communicates with the [[captain]]s of the other ships (the captain of the demolished star destroyer throws his arms up in horror, and the transmission fades). One officer, Captain [[Lorth Needa]], tells Vader that they should consider their damage. Vader firmly replies that they will continue the search. Shortly afterward, Admiral Piett informs Vader that [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] commands he make contact immediately. Vader orders his ship out of the asteroid field for a clear transmission.\n\nIn his private quarters, Vader receives a holographic message from Palpatine, alias Darth Sidious, who alerts the Dark Lord to a \"new enemy who could destroy\" the Empire - Luke Skywalker. Vader suggests that if Luke could be turned, he would be a \"powerful ally\". Lord Sidious agrees, saying that Luke would be a \"great asset\" and asks his apprentice if it could be done. Vader declares Luke will join the Empire \"or die\".\n\nInstead of going straight to Yoda, Luke is brought to the creature's hut. Luke insists on going to find Yoda immediately, but the small creature only responds with \"Not far. Yoda not far.\" The diminutive figure then declares the boy lacks patience, but the voice of Kenobi tells the figure that the boy will learn patience if he is to be trained. Only then does Luke realize that the small green figure ''is'' Yoda. Yoda asks Kenobi if he will finish whatever training he begins, then suspects that Luke will someday succumb to fear.\n\n[[File:Yodalukedagobah.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda teaches Luke the way of the [[Jedi]] and to beware of the [[dark side of the Force]].]]\nThe next day, while cleaning parasitic creatures called Mynocks off the ''Falcon'', Solo and his companions are forced to escape what turns out to be a titanic [[Exogorth|space slug]] (which resided in the asteroid the ''Falcon'' landed on). Meanwhile, Luke begins a rigorous training regime from Yoda which includes moral lessons about the dangers of the dark side of the Force. That particular lesson is driven home when he is told to enter a cave that is strong with the Dark Side's power. Ignoring Yoda's counsel to leave his weapons, Luke enters the cavern armed. Once inside, he has a vision of himself angrily confronting Darth Vader and beheading him. However, the severed head's mask bursts apart and reveals Luke's face with a scared look underneath; it is a warning that if Luke battles Vader with no emotional control, he will become Vader himself, seduced by the Dark Side.\n\nBack on the Star Destroyer, Vader enlists the bounty hunters, [[Boba Fett]], [[Dengar]], [[IG-88B|IG-88]], [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], [[4-LOM]] and [[Zuckuss]] to find the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a \"substantial reward\". One of the Imperial commanders finally spots the ''Falcon'', leading to another pursuit which results in the Falcon eluding the Empire by making the insanely counter intuitive move of attacking the lead Star Destroyer. However, at the last moment, the ship veers off and secretly attaches itself to the rear of the cruiser's command tower, which is not extensively covered by sensors, making it appear to have vanished from the Destroyer's point of view.\n\nDays later, while training, Luke becomes distracted when he finds that his X-wing fighter has almost completely submerged into the swamp. Luke declares he will never be able to get the ship out, seeing that it is too big for him to extract from the water. Yoda says it is \"no different, only different in your mind.\" Luke says he'll \"try\" to lift the ship, but Yoda says \"No! Do or do not, there is no try.\" Luke tries to use the Force, but to no avail. Yoda reminds him that \"size matters not\" and gives him wisdom about the Force. Luke denies all of this, then Yoda decides to use the Force to lift the ship out himself. Luke is dumbfounded and incredulous. Yoda senses the youngster's failures within his mind.\n\n[[File:Falconasteroidsgr.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Galactic Empire|Imperials]] pursue the ''Millennium Falcon'' through an asteroid field.]]\nWhen the fleet disperses to search for the ''Falcon'', the Rebels wait for the ship to do its standard dump of refuse before jumping, then detach to float away with it. The ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive needs repairs, so Han decides to make their way to [[Cloud City]], a gas-mining colony run by his \"old friend\" [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. Unfortunately, the [[bounty hunter]] Boba Fett had deduced the ''Falcon''{{'s}} escape method and had his ship jettisoned with the waste to stealthily follow the fugitives.\n\nThe next day, Yoda reminds Luke of the things the young Jedi will see in his mind, the future, the past, and of friends he recognizes. Luke loses concentration again and has a vision of his friends in danger. He wants to leave Dagobah to rescue them, but Yoda reminds him that if he leaves now, everything his friends fought and suffered for will be destroyed.\n\n===The city in the clouds===\n{{Dialogue|Leia|I love you.|Han|I know.|attr=Han and Leia, on Cloud City|src=Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n\nUpon arrival at Cloud City, Han's party is welcomed by an old friend of his who goes by the name Lando Calrissian. However, there are numerous elements that make the Rebels suspicious, not the least of which being C-3PO being found deactivated, dismembered, and almost recycled.\n\n[[File:Cloud_City.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]].]]\nThat evening, Luke and R2-D2 prepare themselves to leave Dagobah, but are warned by both Yoda and the spirit form of Kenobi not to end training so soon for a fight Luke is not ready for. Ben declares that should Luke decide to face Vader, he will have to face him alone without interference. Luke understands this, and his ship takes off from Dagobah. Yoda is disappointed, declaring Luke is reckless. Ben tells Yoda \"That boy is our last hope\", however, Yoda answers back, \"No... there is another...\"\n\nA day later, Han and company find themselves betrayed by Calrissian who was approached by the Empire just before the Rebels' arrival and threatened him and the city unless he cooperated. They became the captives of Darth Vader, who proceeds to [[torture]] Han and Leia to create a disturbance in the Force for Luke to detect.\n\nMeanwhile, Chewbacca makes an attempt to rebuild C-3PO only to accidentally put the latter's head on backwards. After being tortured, the rebels are informed by Lando that Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO would be confined to Cloud City and Han would be given to Boba Fett. Leia believes Vader wants them all dead, but Lando tells her and the rebels otherwise and that he is after someone called \"Skywalker.\" The rebels immediately realize that Vader wants Luke and has set a trap for him, using them as bait. After Lando announces that Luke was on his way, Han attacks his \"friend,\" only to be restrained by Calrissian's security detail.\n\nThat afternoon, Vader enters a carbon-freezing chamber intending to freeze Luke Skywalker once he arrives. The Dark Lord uses the opportunity for Boba Fett to deliver Solo to Jabba the Hutt (to whom Han owed a debt) by testing the device on Solo himself. Han and company enter the chamber for the experiment. At first, Chewbacca resists the stormtroopers, but Han restrains him, saving his strength for another time. Han says goodbye to Leia with a passionate kiss before he is escalated into the carbon freezing chamber. When he is successfully entombed in carbonite in a state of suspended animation, Vader hands over Han to bounty hunter Boba Fett for transportation to [[Tatooine]] to receive a bounty from Jabba. One of the Imperial commanders informs Vader that Luke's starfighter has arrived on Bespin. The Dark Lord orders Lando to take Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO to his Star Destroyer, reneging on a deal he made with Calrissian. However, the Cloud City administrator has other plans.\n\n===Duel with the Dark Lord and escape from the Cloud City===\n[[File:Lukevaderesb.png|thumb|left|250px|The epic duel begins.]]\nLuke makes his way to Bespin safely. He quietly walks down the corridors of Cloud City. He spots Boba Fett who is taking the now-frozen Solo back to his ship. He attempts to follow but is thwarted when the bounty hunter notices and opens fire. Luke narrowly escapes and runs down farther into the corridor. He finally meets up with Leia, Chewie, and Lando, who have been captured by stormtroopers. Luke tries to ambush the group of Imperials, but is unsuccessful. Leia yells at him and tells him that \"it's a trap!\" Luke runs after his captured friends, hoping to save them, but wanders into the carbon-freezing chamber. There, he meets with Vader and [[Duel on Cloud City|the two fight in an epic lightsaber duel]], where Luke's undeveloped Jedi skills are no match for Vader's experience.\n\nThe Imperials (escorting the Rebel prisoners out of Bespin) are overpowered by Cloud City security, setting Lando and company free. Chewbacca turns against Lando for betraying Han and chokes him, but he manages to tell the Wookiee there's still a chance to rescue Han at the East Platform. C-3PO is reunited with his companion R2-D2. Lando and company arrive too late as Fett's ship takes off, then engage in a fierce battle with stormtroopers.\n\nLuke and Vader continue the duel in the darkened rooms of the Cloud City. Luke didn't follow Han's sad fate when he fell into the freezing mine, but he manages to jump out of it with the help of the Force a moment before Vader activates the freezing system. The fight continues. Vader uses the Dark Side of the Force, hurling everything that comes to hand at Luke: equipment, construction elements and furniture. One of the items breaks the window, creating a vacuum. Luke is quickly pulled out and the fight moves to the emergency platform.\n\nAs the gunfight continues, Lando orders an evacuation of Cloud City before the arrival of the main forces of the Empire, then the rebel company manages to find their last hope of escape...the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nOn the emergency platform of the Cloud City, Luke and Vader continue the duel. Vader knocks Luke off his feet and invites him to surrender so that he won't let himself be killed, like Obi-Wan. However, the young man is not yet defeated and continues to fight. During the duel over the abyss, Luke beats Vader with his saber in his right shoulder, slightly damaging his dark armor. Vader is furious and cuts Luke's right hand holding a lightsaber (the hand and the saber fall into the abyss). Then he reveals to Luke the fatal truth about his father:{{Anchor|father}}{{Dialogue|Darth Vader|Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.|Luke Skywalker|He told me enough! He told me you killed him!|Darth Vader|No, '''''I''''' am your father.|attr=Vader and Luke, on Cloud City|src=Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}Luke does not want to believe what he heard, and accuses Vader of lying, but he advises the young man to listen to his own heart, and thus understand that this is pure truth. Shocked and frightened by the cruel truth, Luke falls into despair, still not wanting to believe what he heard. Vader invites the young man to reunite with him in order to destroy the Emperor together and rule the galaxy as a father and son. However, Luke chooses suicide over being corrupted and throws himself down a deep shaft.[[File:Vader's_revelation.png|thumb|right|250px|\"No. ''I'' am your father.\"]]\nLuke is sucked into an air vent, exits the underbelly of the city and catches an antenna beneath Cloud City. Facing clear death, Luke calls out to Ben Kenobi in vain (Kenobi had warned Luke that he would not be able to help Luke once he faced Vader). Then, he calls out to the only other one who could help... Leia.\n\nLeia mysteriously senses Luke's [[The Force|telepathic]] distress signal. The Falcon turns around and comes back to Cloud City. Using an escape hatch, Lando manages to catch Luke and rescue him before the wounded Jedi falls helplessly to the planet as TIE Fighters race toward them. The Falcon finally leaves Bespin's gravitational field and is about to escape into hyperspace when the hyperdrive system again fails (as it turns out - this is the work of the imperial specialists, as reported by the city computer R2-D2). Vader asks for confirmation that the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''{{'s}} hyperdrive system was deactivated to prevent their escape, then orders weapons be set to stun.\n\n[[File:Empire_endshot.png|thumb|left|250px|The Rebels regroup and plan to rescue Han.]]\nAs the Imperials pursue the ''Falcon'', the injured Luke telepathically hears the voice of Vader calling to him. He answers, \"Father...\", while Vader telepathically calls, \"Son, come with me\". Luke senses it is Vader, then cries, \"Ben, why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nC-3PO commands that R2-D2 finish reconstructing him after his ordeal in Cloud City. However, with quick ingenuity, R2 manages to re-activate the ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive system just in time for the ship to flee to hyperspace. Vader is disappointed and retreats to his secret quarters in his Star Destroyer, ignoring Piett's failure.\n\nThe film ends on a [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]] at the Rebel fleet's rendezvous point, where Luke under the care of 2-1B again which includes the implantation of a [[Cybernetics|prosthetic hand]]. Lando and Chewbacca begin their parts of a most dangerous mission...[[Rescue of Han Solo|rescuing]] Han. Lando promises to Leia they'll bring her back the man she loves. Luke, Leia, and the droids look on as the Falcon departs for unknown territories.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:On_set_dagobah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mark Hamill on set at Pinewood Studios]]\nLucas hired screenwriter [[Leigh Brackett]] to write a screenplay based on his story treatment. Brackett finished the first draft on February 23, 1978, but she died soon afterwards. According to Lucas, he did not like the direction in which her screenplay went. Without a writer to fix it, he was forced to write the second draft himself throughout March.<ref name=\"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back\">''[[The Making of The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref> Major plot changes were made compared to the first draft and the storyline that is in the film was formed in this draft. One of the most notable changes was making [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Vader]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke's]] father.<ref name=\"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back\" /> When [[Lawrence Kasdan]] finished writing the screenplay for [[Wikipedia:Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark|''Raiders of the Lost Ark'']] he was hired to rewrite and improve Lucas' draft. He wrote a few more drafts before the script conference was held in November between [[George Lucas]], [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[Irvin Kershner]] and [[Gary Kurtz]]. After some additional input, the shooting script was finally formed. Minor changes to dialogues came from Kershner and actors throughout the filming and were mostly approved by Lucas.<ref name=\"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\nMajority of the concept art and designs for the film was done by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], [[Joe Johnston]] and [[Nilo Rodis-Jamero]] based on Lucas' ideas.<ref name=\"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back\" /> The [[Yoda|Yoda puppet]] was designed by British make-up artist [[Stuart Freeborn]]. He said he based Yoda's face on his own face and added some of [[Wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] facial features to it.<ref name=\"Empire of Dreams\">''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref>\n\nFilming lasted from [[March 5]] until [[September 24]], [[1979]].

The scenes on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] and inside the Hoth [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]] were shot at [[Elstree Studios]], [[Wikipedia:England|England]].\n\nDuring the production, the film went seriously over-budget and over-schedule. When the film budget increased for $10 million the bank wanted to pull the loan. To secure the additional money required to complete the film, Lucas was forced to approach [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] to negotiate a deal. The studio received more profit from the film while in exchange it guaranteed the loan. Despite this Lucas managed to retain the sequel and merchandising rights.<ref name=\"Empire of Dreams\" />\n\n==Release==\nIn the lead-up to the release of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', various cast members made in-character television appearances to promote the film; [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Peter Mayhew]] on [[Wikipedia:Jim'll Fix It|''Jim'll Fix It'']],<ref>{{Youtube|video=f98TW0-_10c|text=Lucky kid Visits the set of The Empire Strikes Back Dagobah set.

Similarly, in [[September]] 1980, [[CBS]] aired the official making-of documentary, ''[[SPFX: The Empire Strikes Back]]''.\n\n===Merchandise===\nA [[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (novel)|novelization]] of the film was written by [[Donald F. Glut]] and was published on April 12, 1980. The film was adapted into comics form by Marvel Comics as part of their [[Star Wars (1977)|ongoing ''Star Wars'' series]]. Released in six parts (issues [[Star Wars (1977) 39|39]] to [[Star Wars (1977) 44|44]]), the adaptation was scripted by [[Archie Goodwin]] and illustrated by [[Al Williamson]]. (Years later, a [[Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back|manga adaptation]] illustrated by [[Toshiki Kudo]] was released in Japan in 1998 and in the United States in 1999.) [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] launched a [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (toy line)|toyline]] based on the film. A [[The Empire Strikes Back (radio)|radio drama]] adaptation was written by [[Brian Daley]] and produced for broadcast on [[Wikipedia:National Public Radio|National Public Radio]] in [[1983]].\n\n===Re-releases===\n[[File:TESB_30th_Anniversary_logo.png|thumb|right|150px|2010 marked the film's 30th Anniversary]]\nAlong with the other two films of his original trilogy, [[George Lucas]] issued a [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in 1997, making a number of [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|changes and additions]], including replacing a piece of music from the closing scene.\n\nOn [[September 21]], [[2004]] the three original movies were finally released on DVD. There have been [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|a few further minor changes to the film]] on this release&mdash;such as sound effects and improvements to the visual quality of the film. One highly noticeable change involving visually quality improvement is that the odd pink glow was removed from the Cloud City entrance scene, where the Cloud Car was replaced with a [[Tibanna]] refinery in the 1997 theatrical version.\n\nIn addition, the scene in which Darth Vader speaks with the Emperor was altered for the DVD release. Originally, Palpatine was portrayed by a woman wearing a mask with a chimpanzee's eyes superimposed over her own, with an elder male's voice dubbed in later. [[Clive Revill]], who performed Palpatine's voice, and [[Marjorie Eaton]], who portrayed Palpatine physically, were both replaced with [[Ian McDiarmid]], who would eventually be cast for the same role in ''Return of the Jedi'' and all three prequels. However, Revill's name still appeared in the movie's credits as the voice actor for Palpatine. McDiarmid re-recorded the dialogue with [[James Earl Jones]] and they both added more lines for this scene.\n\nAnother addition was [[Temuera Morrison]] providing the voice for [[Boba Fett]], further establishing the fact that Boba is indeed a clone of [[Jango Fett]].\n\n[[File:Empire-at-40-theatres.png|thumb|left|250px|In addition to multiple home video re-releases, the film underwent numerous theatrical re-releases.]]\nThe trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD sets from [[September 12]], [[2006]] to [[December 31]], 2006; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material. Controversy surrounded the release because the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-[[Wikipedia:Anamorphic|anamorphic]] [[Wikipedia:Laserdisc|Laserdisc]] masters, and were not retransferred with modern video standards.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.mindjack.com/film/archives/2006_05_01_archive.html|title=Anamorphic Star Wars and Other Musings|author=Ian Dawe|work=Mindjack Film|archivedate=20200720220906}}</ref> ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was re-released for a Blu-ray format re-release in September of [[2011]].<ref>{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/bluraymay4/index.html|text=Bring the Complete Collection Home: Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray|archivedate=20110507103835}}</ref>\n\nOn [[April 7]], [[2015]], the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released ''Star Wars'' films.

Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through [[May (month)|May]] [[2020]], at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney.

One of Veers's men says, \"Look out! He's going to...\" Hobbie crashes his fighter into the cockpit of Veers's AT-AT Walker, which is blown up, killing both Hobbie and Veers. (The [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] shows both of them alive after the Battle of Hoth.) This scene was likely cut because Veers succeeds in destroying the shield generators, and the filmmakers would have found it difficult to alter the scene so it takes place after Veers destroys them.\n\n===Wampa attack===\n[[File:Wampa_attack_top.jpg|left|thumb|[[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] escapes a wampa]]\n\nAccording to the fourth version of the script for [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']], there is some extra dialogue concerning the wampas and a scene involving R2 getting chased down a hallway by one while the Rebels blast it. One of the Rebels calls in the report saying, \"We got it, sir, but there may be more,\" (talking to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Carlist Rieekan|Rieekan]]). Alarms are buzzing and Leia inquires if the creature has been examined yet. The general tells her they are working on it and then they are alerted to a \"visitor\"&mdash;the Imperial [[Viper probe droid|probot]]. Since it is revealed to be metallic, [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia]] remarks, \"Then it couldn't be one of ''those'' creatures\"&mdash;referring to the wampas, of course.\n\n===Wampas infiltrate Echo Base===\n[[File:Wampas_infiltrate_top.jpg|right|thumb|[[2-1B/Legends|2-1B]] attends to the dead [[Tauntaun/Legends|tauntaun]]]]\n\nIn the scene where [[Han Solo]] is about to go after [[Luke Skywalker]] on a [[tauntaun]], a dead tauntaun is seen on the floor being examined by 2-1B, the medical droid. On the wall is what appears to be some blood, presumably from the dead animal. In the fourth draft of the script, one of the rebels says to his deck officer, \"...I can't imagine, sir. Their necks are broken.\" (The script refers to three dead creatures, not one.) The wampas have already broken into the base at this point and have obviously attacked some tauntauns. They break in once around the time of Han and Leia's argument in the hallway (see the picture below from the comic adaptation) and again when [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are walking towards the hangar and commenting about the temperature in Leia's chamber. Later, when Han is wondering where Luke is, he comes across the Rebels examining the dead tauntaun. They are wondering what happened to this creature as they have no idea yet that wampas have infiltrated the base. It can be noted however, that this scenario is present in the instant action mode of [[Star Wars: Battlefront II]].\n\n===The Wampa Pen===\n[[File:Wampa_pen_top.jpg|left|thumb|The pursuing [[Cold assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]] enter the wampa pen]]\n\nOut of all the cut scenes featuring wampas, this one is the most well-known, perhaps because this scene has left the most evidence behind. Sometime during the Hoth scenes, it's discovered that R2-D2's beeping noises attract the wampas&mdash;just like in the famous \"Pied Piper\" fairy tale. R2-D2 leads the wampas into a large room and the Rebels then place a red and yellow warning sign on the door so Rebels will not wander inside unaware and get eaten. This scene with R2-D2 was allegedly filmed, but never made it into the final cut. Later on, while on their way to the medical center to see Luke, R2-D2 and C-3PO pass by the wampa pen and discuss the creatures briefly.\n\nJumping ahead to the Rebel heroes' exodus from [[Echo Base]] during the [[Battle of Hoth]], Han, Leia, and C-3PO are scurrying to get Leia to her transport. On the way out, they pass a door with a familiar yellow sign with [[Unidentified Rebel script|red lettering]]. Han gives the door a quick look and almost stops but continues on past it after recognizing the warning (the quick shot is in the finished film, it appears directly after General Veers destroys the power generators). What was not included in the film was C-3PO (who is running behind Han and Leia trying to keep up) trudging up to the door after them. He stops and tears off the yellow warning sign (C-3PO is seen tearing off the sign on the \"bonus features\" DVD of the Trilogy box DVD set. The moment is briefly seen in the trailer for Episode V). He then proceeds to catch up with Han and Leia as they make their way to the Millennium Falcon.\n\nAfter the snowtroopers burst into the base, they come across the door, left with only a small piece of the original warning sign. They open the door, only to be attacked by the already annoyed wampas inside.\n\n===Luke: Gunner===\n[[File:Luke_gunner_01.jpg|thumb|[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] mans a heavy [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] weapon against the attacking wampas.]]\nThere have always been rumors and images that state there was originally a scene from ''Empire'' inside Echo Base where Luke mans a gun and blasts a few wampas.\nThe only thing that really makes most fans believe this scene was actually shot is the following quote from Jon Knoles in the [[Star Wars Insider 33|''Star Wars Insider'' 33]] (page 59) talking about the game, ''Shadows of the Empire'' for Nintendo 64: \"We knew, for instance, of the scene where a wampa actually broke through into Echo Base and mauled a tauntaun (and possibly some Rebel troops) and a scene where Luke actually took over an auto-laser cannon and blasts a wampa or two. The wampa filmed in this shot looked absolutely hilarious with a big fluffy face and metallic round eyeballs. We saw the picture in a Kodak shoebox Photo CD that Lucasfilm Ltd. provided us with some time ago.\"{{Fact}}\n\nLater, [[Pablo Hidalgo]] stated that the images of Luke manning a turret were not deleted scenes. According to him, they were simply on set photos taken with the \"Rebel cannon sled\" prop.<ref name=\"Pablo tweet\">{{Twitter|pabl0hidalgo|status/1432779261304258563|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=You may occasionally find photos of Luke in his snowspeeder pilot manning the guns online labeled as a 'deleted scene'.
