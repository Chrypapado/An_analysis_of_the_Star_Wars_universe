It is the first part of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].\n\nThe film is set 19 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]; construction has finished on the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], a weapon capable of destroying a [[planet]]. After [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], a leader of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], receives the weapon's plans in the hope of finding a weakness, she is captured and taken to the Death Star. Meanwhile, a young [[Moisture farmer|farmer]] named [[Luke Skywalker]] meets [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who has lived in seclusion for years on the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. When [[Lars Homestead|Luke's home]] is burned and his [[Beru Whitesun Lars|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars|uncle]] killed, Obi-Wan begins Luke's [[Jedi]] [[Jedi training|training]] as they\u2014along with [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]]\u2014attempt to rescue the princess from the Empire.\n\nInspired by films like the [[Wikipedia:Flash Gordon (serial)|''Flash Gordon'']] [[Wikipedia:Movie serial|serials]] and the [[Wikipedia:Samurai|samurai]] films of [[Wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa]], as well as such critical works as [[Wikipedia:Joseph Campbell|Joseph Campbell's]] [[Wikipedia:The Hero with a Thousand Faces|''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'']] and Frank Herbert's [[Wikipedia:Dune (franchise)|''Dune'']] books, Lucas began work on ''Star Wars'' in 1974. Ground-breaking in its use of [[Wikipedia:Special effect|special effects]], this is considered to be among the most successful\u2014and most influential\u2014films of all time. Produced with a budget of [[Wikipedia:US$|US$]]11,000,000 and released on [[May 25]], [[1977]], the film became one of the most successful of all time, earning $215 million in the [[Wikipedia:United States|United States]] and $337 million overseas during its original theatrical release, as well as winning several film awards, including 10 [[Wikipedia:Academy Award|Academy Award]] nominations. It was re-released several times, sometimes with [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|significant changes]]; the most notable versions were the 1997 [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] and the 2004 [[Wikipedia:DVD|DVD]], which were modified with [[Wikipedia:Computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects and recreated scenes. It was re-released in the Blu-ray format in [[September]] of [[2011]]. The film was selected to be preserved by the [[Wikipedia:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] as part of its [[Wikipedia:National Film Registry|National Film Registry]].

The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] has won their first major victory by [[Battle of Scarif|stealing]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[Galactic Empire]]'s secret weapon, the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. Hoping that the stolen plans can save her [[Alderaanian|people]] and restore freedom to the galaxy, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who is in custody of the stolen plans attempts to race [[Alderaan|home]] aboard the ''[[Tantive IV]]''. However, her ship is intercepted by the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial'' ''I''-class]] [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]'' over the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]].\n\n[[File:Devastatortantiveiv.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia]] is captured by the [[Galactic Empire]].]]\nImperial [[stormtrooper]]s manage to board the ship, and after defeating the small number of [[Rebel trooper|guards]] defending the ship, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrives to assess the damage. Vader is outraged and questions [[Raymus Antilles|Captain Antilles]], whom he eventually strangles and kills. Hiding on the ship, Princess Leia is spotted by stormtroopers. They shoot her with a stun blast and bring her before Vader. However, before being detained, Leia was able to record a [[Hologram|holographic]] message with the help of [[R2-D2]], and assigned the [[droid]] the responsibility of taking the message to a Jedi-in-hiding on [[Tatooine]]. Vader orders a message be sent to the [[Imperial Senate]], informing them that the ship was destroyed, with everyone on board killed. R2-D2 and [[C-3PO]] use an escape pod in order to escape the ship and reach the planet of Tatooine below.\n\n===Luke's destiny===\n[[File:Lukesaberanh.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Luke Skywalker]] receives [[Anakin Skywalker|his father's]] [[lightsaber]].]]\n{{Quote|There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nThe droids are bought by moisture farmer [[Owen Lars]] and his nephew, [[Luke Skywalker]]. R2-D2 escapes from the Lars' homestead in search of an [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom the droid claims to be the property of. Luke and C-3PO find R2 the next day just before they are attacked by [[Tusken Raider|Sand people]]. Luke and his droids are rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi or, as Luke knows him, Ben Kenobi. Obi-Wan takes Luke to his home.\n\nLuke receives his father's [[lightsaber]], as Obi-Wan recalls his own friendship with Luke's father. Luke is told that a [[Jedi]] named Darth Vader betrayed and murdered his father. After discovering Princess Leia's message carried by R2-D2, Obi-Wan attempts to persuade Luke to accompany him to [[Alderaan]]. Luke refuses to go until he discovers that his aunt and uncle were brutally murdered by stormtroopers searching for the droids. Luke, Obi-Wan, and the two droids travel to [[Mos Eisley]] to find passage to Alderaan, Princess Leia's home planet.\n\nFor 17,000 [[credit]]s, 2,000 in advance and 15,000 upon arrival, [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and his [[First Mate]], a [[Wookiee]] named [[Chewbacca]], agree to take the four of them to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. After brief scuffles with the Empire and henchmen sent by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]], the ''Falcon'' escapes the Imperial Blockade at Mos Eisley and Han sets a course for Alderaan, unaware that the planet was about to be mercilessly destroyed by the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]].\n\n===Rescue of the princess===\n{{Quote|Here's where the fun begins!|Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nIn Alderaan's place, they find what seems to be an asteroid field. The planet was destroyed by the dreaded [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], on the orders of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Tarkin]], to set an example of the power of the Empire. The ''Millennium Falcon'' is pulled aboard the Death Star by its powerful [[tractor beam]].\n\n[[File:Got_A_Bad_feeling.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Heroes en route to the Death Star]]\nFrom hidden smuggling compartments, Solo ambushes two stormtroopers of the Imperial scanning crew. With Han and Luke now disguised as the two stormtroopers, the group begins to figure out how to escape. Obi-Wan separates from the group to disable the tractor beam, leaving the others alone. While connected to the Imperial Network, R2-D2 discovers Princess Leia is aboard the station. Luke convinces Han and Chewbacca to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue her]] with the vague promise of a grand reward. Han and Chewbacca reluctantly agree. Luke plans to march into [[Detention Block AA-23]], claiming that Chewbacca is part of a prisoner transfer. C-3PO and R2-D2 are instructed to remain behind, and the trio sets off on their rescue attempt. Luke's plan works flawlessly in that they are quick to subdue the officers and guards in the princess's cell block. Unfortunately, no one thought to plan for their escape, and Leia takes charge, blasting a hole in a nearby grate and jumping through while Han and Luke hold off a squad of stormtroopers. Chewbacca, Luke and Han all dive after the princess into the unknown.\n\nUnfortunately, the grate covers a chute that leads to a [[garbage compactor]] that is also home to a [[Omi|resident]] [[dianoga]]. Soon after landing, the creature pulls Luke under the surface, but releases him and is scared away when the Imperials realize where the heroes escaped to and activate the compactor. As the walls close in on the foursome, Luke desperately calls to C-3PO over his comlink asking for the compactor to be shut down. Leia struggles to get to the top and Chewbacca tries to unlock the door. R2-D2 manages to shut down the compactor just in time, although, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the comlink, C-3PO is briefly convinced that his master and friends have been crushed.\n\nAfter escaping from the trash compactor, the group hurries back to the ''Millennium Falcon,'' hoping that Obi-Wan has successfully shut down the tractor beam. They encounter stormtroopers on their way to the ship, evading and blasting their way past them.\n\n===Sacrifice and victory===\n[[File:Obiwanvaderanhduel.png|thumb|right|250px|\"You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\"]]\n{{Quote|This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi. It will soon see the end of the Rebellion.|Darth Vader|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nObi-Wan, on the other hand, was destined to meet with Darth Vader. After a short duel with his former [[Padawan]], Obi-Wan sacrifices himself, thus becoming one with the Force and allowing Luke and the others to escape. Horrified and angered having witnessed Obi-Wan's demise at the hands of Vader, Luke takes his final blasts at the stormtroopers and dashes onto the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nAfter fighting a squadron of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], the ''Millennium Falcon'' meets the Rebel Alliance on [[Yavin 4]], and the information in R2-D2 is turned over. [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]] plans the attack on the Death Star, an attack so audacious as to receive an unenthusiastic reaction from the pilots. To add to Luke's dismay, Han leaves after receiving his reward.\n\n[[File:Battle_of_Yavin.png|thumb|left|250px|Rebel fighters approach the Death Star.]]\nThe Rebel strike force begins its attack on the Death Star, as the space station approaches the Rebel base on Yavin 4. A group of starfighters assaults a trench on the Death Star's surface to hit the station's vulnerable spot before it can destroy the Alliance's base. During this, most of the Rebel craft, including Luke's friend [[Biggs Darklighter]], are picked off by Imperial fighters led by Darth Vader. Just as Vader opens fire on Luke from his personal [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced]] fighter, Han returns in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and attacks the Imperials, resulting in Vader's ship getting knocked out of the trench. Luke, aided by the voice of Kenobi and guided by the Force, accurately fires two [[proton torpedo]]es into a small exhaust port leading to the Death Star's reactor, and the battle station explodes.\n\nThe few remaining ships (those of [[Wedge Antilles]], Luke, Han, and a [[Evaan Verlaine|Y-wing Pilot]]) return to Yavin 4 and a [[Royal Award Ceremony|victory celebration]] commences, complete with [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] for the heroes, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, presented by Princess Leia.\n\n==Development==\n===Conception===\nDuring post-production on his previous film, [[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|''American Graffiti'']], Lucas repeatedly discussed the concept of a \"[[Wikipedia:Space opera|space opera]]\" with producer [[Gary Kurtz]].<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\">''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2005]</ref> In January 1973 Lucas began work on this, and by May had prepared a 14-page story outline for distribution among film studios.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> He had originally envisioned the film as being a continuation of both ''American Graffiti'' and [[Wikipedia:Apocalypse Now|''Apocalypse Now'']] (the latter of which he helped make before [[Wikipedia:Warner Bros. Studios|Warner Bros. Studios]] shut down his studio of [[Wikipedia:American Zoetrope|American Zoetrope]] and thus forced him to hand over development to his compatriot, Francis Ford Coppola). His note for the basic plotline for the film, which was intended to be a response to the Vietnam War era, was that it involved \"[[Wikipedia:United States of America|a technological empire]] going after [[Wikipedia:Viet Cong|a small band of freedom fighters]].\"<ref name=\"New York Post\">{{Cite_web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/21/how-star-wars-was-secretly-george-lucas-protest-of-vietnam/|title=How 'Star Wars' was secretly George Lucas' Vietnam protest|author=Kyle Smith|date=2014-10-21|work=New York Post|archivedate=20180826122931}}</ref><ref name=\"How Star Wars Conquered the Universe\">''How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise''; Taylor, Chris; Basic Books (2014)</ref> According to Walter Murch, a former associate of Lucas when the latter was filming ''Apocalypse Now'', the space opera setting was conceived in large part because, due to the Vietnam War still going on, the audiences would not have been receptive to a direct attack on American involvement in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Metaphor\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.yomyomf.com/star-wars-is-a-metaphor-for-the-vietcong-kicking-american-ass-in-the-vietnam-war|title='Star Wars' is a Metaphor for the Vietcong Kicking American Ass in the Vietnam War?|author=Philip|date=2015-12-16|work=[http://www.yomyomf.com YOMYOMF]|archivedate=20160610224959}}</ref><ref name=\"Walter Murch\">''The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film''.

Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd \"invested in me, [but] he did not invest in the movie.\"<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\n===Production===\nLucas finished a draft of the screenplay in May 1974. As the draft developed, the characters evolved significantly. Early in development, Luke Skywalker's character changed from a 60-year-old general to a member of a family of [[Wikipedia:Dwarf|dwarfs]];<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Characters\">''The Characters of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials, [2004]</ref> the [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] smuggler, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], was envisioned as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.<ref name=\"Characters\" /> [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] was inspired by Lucas' [[Wikipedia:Alaskan malamute|Alaskan malamute]] dog, [[Indiana]], who often acted as the director's \"co-pilot\" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.<ref name=\"Characters\" /> [[The Force]], a mysterious energy field, was initially conceived as the [[Kyber crystal]], a \"galactic holy grail.\"<ref name=\"Genesis\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.lofficier.com/starwars.htm|title=The Star Wars Genesis: How the Classic SF Saga Evolved|author=Randy Lofficier, Jean-Marc Lofficier|format=Blog post|archivedate=20200716191436}}</ref><ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> The completed script was too long for one movie; however, Lucas refused to condense it.

ILM began its work on ''Star Wars'' in a warehouse in [[Wikipedia:Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys, California]]. Most of the visual effects used [[Wikipedia:Motion control photography|motion control photography]], which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras. Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by [[Joe Johnston]], input from Lucas, and paintings by McQuarrie. Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a \"used universe\" in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Legacy\">''The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials, [2004]</ref><ref name=\"ILM Bio\">{{SWArchive|url=bio/industriallightmagic.html|text=Star Wars Biography: Industrial Light & Magic|archivedate=20010417114402}}</ref>\n\nWhen filming began on [[March 22]], [[1976]] in the [[Tunisia]]n desert for the scenes on the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], the project faced several problems.{{Fact}} Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to a rare Tunisian rainstorm, malfunctioning props, and electronic breakdowns.<ref name=\"Heritage\">{{Cite_web|url=http://americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060525-star-wars-george-lucas-movies-hollywood-luke-skywalker-darth-vader-american-graffiti-science-fiction-special-effects.shtml|title=How Star Wars Surprised the World|author=David Rapp|date=2006-05-25|work=[http://americanheritage.com AmericanHeritage.com]|archivedate=20060618153107}}</ref> When actor [[Anthony Daniels]] wore the [[C-3PO]] outfit for the first time, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him. After completing filming in Tunisia, production moved into the more controlled environment of [[Elstree Studios]], near London.<ref name=\"Heritage\" /> However, significant problems, such as a [[Wikipedia:Film crew|crew]] that had little interest in the film, still arose.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Heritage\" /> Most of the crew considered the project a \"children's film,\" rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.<ref>''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]]''</ref> Actor [[Kenny Baker]] later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. [[Harrison Ford]] found the film \"weird,\" in that there was a princess with buns for hair and what he called a \"giant in a monkey suit\" named Chewbacca.{{Fact}} Ford also found the dialogue difficult, saying, \"You can type this shit, George, but you sure can't say it.\"<ref>[[Wikipedia:Dale Pollock|Dale Pollock]]. ''Skywalking: the Life and Films of George Lucas''. [[Ballantine Books]], 1984. {{ISBN|0-345-31419-0}}. Page 179.</ref>\n\nLucas clashed with [[Wikipedia:Director of Photography|Director of Photography]] [[Gilbert Taylor]], whom producer [[Gary Kurtz]] called \"old-school\" and \"crotchety.\"<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> Moreover, with a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His camera suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was over-stepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions. Lucas eventually became frustrated that the costumes, sets and other elements were not living up to his original vision of ''Star Wars''. He rarely spoke to the actors, who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words \"faster\" and \"more intense.\"<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nLadd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from [[Wikipedia:Board of directors|board]] members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. After production fell two weeks behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor [[Robert Watts]], respectively. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Heritage\" /> ILM concluded shooting on [[April 22]], 1977 with shot 110P, that of a Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"swi95\">[[Star Wars Insider 95|''Star Wars Insider'' 95]]</ref>\n\n''Star Wars'' was originally slated for release in [[Wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]] 1976; however, delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when his editor's first cut of the film was a \"complete disaster.\" After attempting to persuade the original editor to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced the editor with [[Paul Hirsch]] and [[Richard Chew]]. He also allowed his then-wife [[Marcia Lucas]] to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film [[Wikipedia:New York, New York (film)|''New York, New York'']] with Lucas' friend [[Wikipedia:Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese]]. Richard Chew found the film had an non-energetic pace; it had been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in [[Wikipedia:Master shot|master shots]] that flowed into [[Wikipedia:Close-up|close-up]] coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously; whoever finished first moved on to the next.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nDuring production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Heritage\" /> [[Wikipedia:Post-production|Post-production]] was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, [[Mark Hamill]]'s face was injured in a car accident, which made reshoots impossible.<ref name=\"Heritage\" />\n\nMeanwhile, ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.<ref name=\"Heritage\" /> Moreover, theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline, forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial [[Starfighter combat/Legends|dogfights]] from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nDuring the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and [[Wikipedia:Sound effect|sound effects]]. Sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an \"organic soundtrack.\" For [[Chewbacca]]'s growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Burtt created the robotic voice of [[R2-D2]] by filtering his voice through an electronic synthesizer. [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a [[Wikipedia:Scuba set|scuba]] tank implanted with a microphone.<ref name=\"Silicon\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/burtt/index.html|title=Interview with Ben Burtt|format=Radio interview|work=Silicon Valley Radio|archivedate=19970624121226}}</ref> Lucas never intended to use the voice of [[David Prowse]], who portrayed Darth Vader in costume, because of Prowse's thick English [[Wikipedia:West Country|West Country]] accent. He originally wanted [[Wikipedia:Orson Welles|Orson Welles]] to speak for Darth Vader. However, he felt that Welles' voice would be too recognizable, so he cast the lesser-known [[James Earl Jones]].<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.premiere.com/features/2164/the-force-wasnt-with-them.html|title=The Force Wasn't With Them|author=Tom Russo|work=Premiere Magazine|archivedate=20071106045549}}</ref> Nor did Lucas intend to use Anthony Daniels' voice for C-3PO. Thirty well-established voice actors, such as [[Wikipedia:Stan Freberg|Stan Freberg]], read for the voice of the droid. According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors recommended Daniels' voice for the role.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /><ref name=\"Characters\" />\n\nWhen Lucas screened an early cut of the film for his friends, among them directors [[Brian De Palma]], [[Wikipedia:John Milius|John Milius]] and [[Steven Spielberg]], their reactions were disappointing. Spielberg, who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film,<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Alan Ladd, Jr. and the rest of 20th Century Fox loved the film; one of the executives, Gareth Wigan, told Lucas, \"This is the greatest film I've ever seen,\" and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> Although the delays increased the budget from $8 million to $11 million, the film was still the least expensive of the ''Star Wars'' saga.\n\n===Music===\nLucas's intentions for ''Star Wars'' involved a grand musical sound, with [[Wikipedia:Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] for different characters and important objects, an approach used to great effect, for instance, in the operas of [[Wikipedia:Richard Wagner|Richard Wagner]]. Toward this end, Lucas put together a collection of classical pieces for the composer [[John Williams]] to review, as an idea of what effects Lucas desired for the films. The music Williams composed was often distinctly reminiscent of the original classical pieces. In particular:\n*The music associated to the opening capture of the blockade runner is very similar to ''Mars'', from [[Wikipedia:Gustav Holst|Holst's]] [[Wikipedia:The Planets|''The Planets'']]. In the liner notes to the original soundtrack recording, Williams implicitly acknowledged the connection by explaining why he didn't simply use Holst's ''The Planets''. He said that he felt he could give the music a more unified feel if he wrote it all himself.\n*The \"[[Binary Sunset|Force Theme]]\" (or \"Ben's Theme\") has been compared to parts of the [[Wikipedia:Ballet|ballet]] [[Wikipedia:Swan Lake|''Swan Lake'']].\n*The music for the awards ceremony at the end of the movie begins with \"the Force/Ben's Theme,\" and then transitions into a theme that, in the liner notes, Williams says is reminiscent of \"The Coronation,\" which probably refers to [[Wikipedia:Edward Elgar|Elgar's]], or, more likely, [[Wikipedia:William Walton|William Walton's]] [[Wikipedia:Crown Imperial (musical composition)|Coronation March]].\n*The opening title (the \"theme from ''Star Wars'',\" or \"Luke's Theme\") has been said to resemble John Barry's theme from [[Wikipedia:Born Free|''Born Free'']], but has a similar facade to the opening strains of the 1942 film ''King's Row'', scored by [[Wikipedia:Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. Later John Williams themes, such as those from [[Wikipedia:E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'']], have been said to resemble it. Listening to them together, one observes that none is identical to any of the others, but they use many of the same musical intervals to achieve similar, or at least related, emotional effects.{{Fact}}\n*The music for C-3PO's and R2-D2's arrival on Tatooine is very similar to the beginning of the second part, titled ''The Sacrifice'', of [[Wikipedia:Igor Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky's]],[[Wikipedia:The Rite of Spring|The Rite of Spring]],.\n\nMajor musical themes include:\n*[[Star Wars Main Title]]\n*[[Princess Leia's Theme]]\n*[[Binary Sunset]]\n\n===Sound===\n''A New Hope'' was originally presented in monaural sound in many theaters, though the first-run [[Wikipedia:70mm film|70mm]] prints were some of the earliest wide-release examples of surround sound\u2014something not seen in the commercial cinema since the [[Wikipedia:Cinerama|Cinerama]] and [[Wikipedia:Cinemascope|Cinemascope]] experiments of the early 1950s.\n\n===Sources and inspirations===\nThe film drew inspiration from a number of sources. This was conscious and has been acknowledged by George Lucas in interviews. It is characteristic of much myth-building.\n\nLucas has stated that Akira Kurosawa's [[1950s|1958]] film ''The Hidden Fortress'' (USA release [[1960s|1962]]) was a strong influence. The resemblance between the two buffoon farmers in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and the two talkative droids in ''A New Hope'' is apparent. Indeed, when the droids find themselves alone on Tatooine, even the music and the style of \"wipe\" cuts are a clear homage to ''Hidden Fortress''. When [[Conan Antonio Motti/Legends|Motti]] is criticizing [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], he is about to mention the Rebels' \"hidden fortress\" before Vader cuts him off in the middle of the last word.\n\nThe climactic scene in which the Death Star is assaulted was modeled after (including some of the same dialogue) the 1950s film [[Wikipedia:The Dam Busters (movie)|''The Dam Busters'']], in which [[Wikipedia:Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Wikipedia:Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim \"[[Wikipedia:Bouncing bomb|bouncing bombs]]\" at German man-made dams in a bid to cripple the heavy industry of the [[Wikipedia:Ruhr|Ruhr]]. (''A New Hope'' cinematographer [[Wikipedia:Gilber Taylor|Gilbert Taylor]] had previously worked on the special-effects sequences for that film.)\n\nLucas has made mention of the film \"[[Wikipedia:633 Squadron|633 Squadron]]\" directed by [[Wikipedia:Walter Grauman|Walter Grauman]] when citing movies that inspired themes or elements in ''A New Hope''. The \"trench run\" in ''A New Hope'' wherein Luke flies his X-wing through a \"trench\" on the Death Star and destroys the ship was inspired, at least in small part, by the finale of [[Wikipedia:633 Squadron|633 Squadron]], which involves several Royal Air Force planes flying at low level up a fjord against heavy, ground-based anti-aircraft fire, to attack a factory located at the base of a cliff at the canyon's end.\n\n==Release==\nWary that ''Star Wars'' would be beaten out by other summer films, such as [[Wikipedia:Smokey and the Bandit|''Smokey and the Bandit'']], 20th Century Fox moved the release date to Wednesday before [[Wikipedia:Memorial Day|Memorial Day]]: [[May 25]], [[1977]]. However, few theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, 20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order ''Star Wars'' if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best-selling novel titled [[Wikipedia:The Other Side of Midnight|''The Other Side of Midnight'']].<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> [[Wikipedia:The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] published the first advertisements for the film on [[May 15]], only ten days before its premiere.<ref name=\"Season 2 Directors\">{{SWYoutube|u0Z7i0LnXOg|Mandalorian Season 2 Directors, We Celebrate a Birthday, and More!|archivedate=20200515034925}}</ref>\n\n''Star Wars'' became an instant success upon release; within three weeks, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. Before 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37,000,000; in 1977, the company earned $79,000,000. Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in [[Wikipedia:Japan|Japan]]. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading Ladd, Jr. to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. He was later told that, in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film. Meanwhile, thousands attended a ceremony at [[Wikipedia:Grauman's Chinese Theater|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], where C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nDuring the film's original theatrical run, there were a number of now-iconic television promotions:\n*A re-creation of the cantina set for [[Wikipedia:The Richard Pryor Show|''The Richard Pryor Show'']] (September 13, 1977)\n*''[[The Making of Star Wars]]'' TV special (September 16, 1977)\n*A ''Star Wars''&ndash;themed [[Wikipedia:Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|''Donnie and Marie'']] episode (September 23, 1977)\n*Mark Hamill on [[Wikipedia:Bob Hope television specials|''The Bob Hope All Star Christmas Comedy Special'']] (December 19, 1977)\n*[[Wikipedia:Bill Murray|Bill Murray's]] \"[[Wikipedia:Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1976\u20131977#Nick The Lounge Singer|Nick The Lounge Singer]]\" singing the ''Star Wars'' Main Theme on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (January 28, 1978)\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (November 17, 1978)<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/70starwars.html|title=Star Wars on TV|author=L. Wayne Hicks|archivedate=20200513205029}}</ref>\n*Carrie Fisher on ''Saturday Night Live'' (November 18, 1978)\n\n===Merchandise===\n[[Charles Lippincott]] was hired by Lucas' production company, [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]], as marketing director for ''Star Wars''. Because 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Marvel Comics]] for a comic book adaptation and with [[Del Rey]] Books for a novelization. Although ''Star Wars'' merchandise was available to enthusiastic children upon release, only [[Kenner Products|Kenner Toys]]\u2014who believed that the film would be unsuccessful\u2014had accepted Lippincott's licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its \"empty box\" Christmas campaign; these vouchers could be redeemed for [[Star Wars (toy line)|the toys]] in March 1978.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nThe [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|novelization]] of the film was published in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been [[Wikipedia:Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by [[Alan Dean Foster]], who later wrote the first [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]''. The book was first published as ''Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker''; later editions were titled simply ''Star Wars'' and, later, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', to reflect the retitling of the film. Certain scenes deleted from the film (and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features) were present in the novel, such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba in Docking Bay 94. Other deleted scenes from the movie, such as a close-up of a stormtrooper riding on a [[Dewback/Legends|Dewback]], were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book. Smaller details were also changed; for example, in the Death Star assault, Luke's callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film. Lippincott secured the deal with [[Del Rey]] Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" />\n\nA [[Star Wars (radio)|radio drama]] adaptation of the film was written by [[Brian Daley]], directed by [[John Madden]], and produced for and broadcast on the American [[National Public Radio]] network in 1981. The adaptation received cooperation from [[George Lucas]], who donated the rights to NPR. John Williams' music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show; Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles as well. The radio drama featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. In terms of [[Canon|''Star Wars'' canon]], the radio drama is given the highest designation, G-canon.<ref>{{Blog|holocron|4|What is the Holocron?|Keeper of the Holocron's Blog|Leland Chee|archivedate=20051122155636}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, several comic adaptations of the film have been produced:\n\n*[[Star Wars (1977)|Marvel Comics]] launched their Star Wars series with a six-part adaptation of the film written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]].\n*In 1978, [[Al Williamson]] worked on an adaptation in comic strip form that was never released.\n*Concurrently with the release of the 1997 Special Edition, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a new [[Star Wars: A New Hope - The Special Edition|four-part adaptation]] written by [[Bruce Jones]] and illustrated by [[Eduardo Barreto]].\n*A [[Star Wars Manga: A New Hope|manga adaptation]] illustrated by [[Hisao Tamaki]] was released in Japan in 1997 and in the United States in 1998.\n\n===Re-releases===\nThe film was originally released as\u2014and consequently often called\u2014''Star Wars'', without ''Episode IV'' or the subtitle ''A New Hope''. The 1980 sequel, [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl. When the original film was re-released on [[April 10]], 1981, ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' was added above the original opening crawl.<ref name=\"Shakespeare meets TROS\">{{SWYoutube|5ZzBeDtSnr0|Shakespeare meets Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Your Fan Art, and More!|archivedate=20200502000339}}</ref> Although Lucas claims that only six films were ever planned, representatives of Lucasfilm discussed plans for nine or 12 possible films in early interviews.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915986,00.html|title=George Lucas' Galactic Empire|date=1978-03-06|publisher=Time.com|archivedate=20070930035556}}</ref> The film was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1997.\n\n[[File:Star_Wars_1997_re-release_poster.jpg|thumb|right|Official poster for ''A New Hope'' Special Edition release]]\nAfter ILM used [[Wikipedia:Computer generated imagery|computer generated effects]] for Steven Spielberg's [[Wikipedia:Jurassic Park (film)|''Jurassic Park'']], Lucas concluded that digital technology had caught up to his original vision for ''Star Wars''.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\" /> As part of ''Star Wars''{{'}} 20th anniversary celebration in 1997, ''A New Hope'' was digitally remastered and re-released to theaters, along with ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], under the campaign title ''The Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition''.

[[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] was awarded to [[John Mollo]]; [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] went to [[Paul Hirsch]], [[Marcia Lucas]] and [[Richard Chew]]; [[John Stears]], [[John Dykstra]], [[Richard Edlund]], [[Grant McCune]] and [[Robert Blalack]] all received awards for [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Effects, Visual Effects]].

At the [[Wikipedia:Golden Globe|Golden Globe]] awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor ([[Alec Guinness]]), and Best Score. It only won the award for Best Score. It received six [[Wikipedia:British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations: Best Film, Best Editing, Best Costume, Best Production/Art Design, Best Sound, and Best Score; the film won in the latter two categories. [[John Williams]]' soundtrack album won the [[Wikipedia:Grammy|Grammy]] award for Best Album of an original score for a motion picture or television program,and the film was awarded the [[Wikipedia:Hugo Award|Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation. In 1997, the [[Wikipedia:MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] awarded Chewbacca the lifetime achievement award for his work in the ''Star Wars'' trilogy.{{Fact}}\n\nOriginally, if the film did poorly at the box office, Lucas planned to turn the novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' into a low-budget sequel to the movie. According to an interview with [[Alan Dean Foster]] in [[Wikipedia:Empire (magazine)|''Empire'']] magazine, the book was written to be filmed as a low-budget sequel if ''Star Wars'' was not a huge success. [[Harrison Ford]] was not signed for the sequel as of the writing of the book, which is why [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] does not appear in the novel. However, with the success of ''A New Hope'', Lucas was free to make ''The Empire Strikes Back''.{{Fact}}\n\n==Deleted scenes==\nThere are many short alternate takes throughout ''Star Wars'' where Luke appears in his poncho: Luke in the desert, in the Tusken Raiders' canyon, Luke finding the destroyed homestead, and in the hangar on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. The only poncho scenes that made the final cut were in Docking Bay 94, on the ''Millennium Falcon'' flight from the Death Star, and on arrival on Yavin 4.\n\n===Aunt Beru's Blue Milk===\n[[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru]] is in the homestead, pouring a blue liquid into a jug.\n\n===Luke in the Desert===\n[[File:EP4_luke_watching_battle.jpg|right|thumb|Luke with his [[Macrobinoculars/Legends|macrobinoculars]]]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] is in the [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] desert repairing a [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|moisture vaporator]], assisted by a [[WED Treadwell repair droid|Treadwell]] droid, when he notices shining objects in the sky. With his [[Macrobinoculars/Legends|macrobinoculars]] Luke sees two ships engaged in combat beyond the atmosphere. He jumps into his [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]]. The malfunctioning Treadwell blows a fuse and is unable to follow. Luke speeds off into the desert to find his friends. The scene originally occurred after the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] is boarded, just before [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] first appearance in the film. It is thought that there is no longer any clear footage of this scene available. Existing footage has been degraded by poor film storage conditions over the years. Before the film was cut, this was the audience's first sight of the young Luke Skywalker, much earlier than in the final cut. It was removed along with subsequent scenes of Luke and his friends in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. George Lucas had originally written the scenes and shot them at the suggestion of his industry friends who thought that audiences wouldn't understand the story strictly being told from a droid's point of view. Upon realizing that the story was really about the droids' adventures and it was them leading things to Luke and Obi-Wan, etc. Lucas took the footage out.\n\n===Tosche Station===\nLuke's landspeeder races into the town of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]], nearly running over an old woman. Luke rushes into [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]] excitedly telling his friends about the battle above their planet. He is overjoyed to be reunited with his friend [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]] who is on planet leave from the Academy. [[Deacon|Deak]], [[Windy Starkiller|Windy]], [[Camie Loneozner|Camie]], [[Laze Loneozner/Legends|Fixer]] and Biggs all follow Luke outside to see the battle with Luke's macrobinoculars. The battle appears to have ended and Luke's friends ridicule him for making it all up. This scene was to come just after [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] eject from the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] in an escape pod, and before the scene where [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] is led captive before [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. This scene establishes Luke's difficult relationships with his peers, and gives a picture of life on Tatooine. Storyline pacing may have been the deciding factor, but it should also be borne in mind that after Lucas's first screening of the rough cut of ''Star Wars'' in 1977, a fellow filmmaker jokingly accused him of producing \"[[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|American Graffiti]] in space.\" This jibe probably influenced Lucas to cut the scenes set in Anchorhead. The sequence where Luke nearly runs down an old woman was an effects shot that was never completed.\n\n===Luke and Biggs===\n[[File:LukeBiggs2-MOSW.png|right|thumb|Luke says farewell to Biggs]]\nThis scene is a conversation between Luke and his oldest friend, [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]]. Biggs has left Tatooine and is on planet leave from the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]] where he is training to be a space pilot. Luke's envy of Biggs's success conflicts with his duty to his uncle and his reasons for remaining on Tatooine. Biggs quietly tells Luke that he has decided to join the Rebellion against the Empire. In a tense and emotional conversation, the two young men say their final farewells. This scene was to come in between the scene where C-3PO spots a distant Jawa sandcrawler in the desert, and the capture of R2-D2 by the Jawas in the canyon. The Luke and Biggs sequence was part of the whole Anchorhead backstory on Tatooine, and was cut along with the other early scenes on Tatooine, probably for reasons of story pacing.\n\n===Vader and Chief Bast===\nIn this short scene, Darth Vader and Chief [[Moradmin Bast/Legends|Bast]] walk along a corridor on the Death Star. Bast reports that the search for the missing droids has extended to Mos Eisley spaceport. Vader observes that Princess Leia is resisting interrogation, and Bast boldly criticizes [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Tarkin's]] plan to break her as \"foolish.\" The scene would have appeared between the scene where Han Solo encounters [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] in [[Docking Bay 94/Legends|Docking Bay 94]] (also cut), and the scene where Luke and Ben find the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] in Docking Bay 94.\n\n===The Search for R2===\n[[File:SearchForArtoo-MOSW.png|thumb|C-3PO pilots the [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]]]]\n[[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] has absconded from his new master, Luke Skywalker. Early in the morning, Luke and Threepio rush off in the landspeeder to search for R2, with Threepio driving the landspeeder. They talk about Artoo, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Ben Kenobi]], and how angry Uncle Owen is going to be. The scene belongs at the start of the sequence where Luke and 3PO search for R2, before the attack of the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. The moment was scored with a light version of Luke's theme; the music can be heard at the beginning of the cue \"Land of the Sand People\" on the original LP and CD configurations, or \"Landspeeder Search\" in the Special Edition album. Before the days of CGI, scenes like this landspeeder cockpit sequence had to be filmed against a rear-projection screen. The scene was dropped due to poor quality.\n\n===Stormtrooper Search===\nVarious alien creatures are seen walking around a narrow street in [[Mos Eisley]], and some [[Stormtrooper]]s walk past.\n\n===Darth Vader widens the Search===\nThis is a scene with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and another Imperial officer on the [[Death Star]].\n\n==Credits==\n{{Credits\n|cast=\n*'''[[Mark Hamill]]''' as '''[[Luke Skywalker]]'''\n*'''[[Harrison Ford]]''' as '''[[Han Solo]]'''\n*'''[[Carrie Fisher]]''' as '''Princess [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]'''\n*'''[[Peter Cushing]]''' as '''Grand Moff [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Tarkin]]'''\n*'''[[Alec Guinness]]''' as '''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi]]'''\n*'''[[Anthony Daniels]]''' as '''[[C-3PO|See-Threepio (C-3PO)]]'''\n*'''[[Kenny Baker]]''' as '''[[R2-D2|Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2)]]'''\n*'''[[Peter Mayhew]]''' as '''[[Chewbacca]]'''\n*'''[[David Prowse]]''' as '''[[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]'''\n*'''[[James Earl Jones]]''' as the voice of '''[[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]''' {{C|uncredited in original versions}}\n*'''[[Phil Brown]]''' as '''Uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]]'''\n*'''[[Shelagh Fraser]]''' as '''Aunt [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]]'''\n*'''[[Jack Purvis]]''' as '''Chief [[Jawa]]'''\n*'''[[Alex McCrindle]]''' as '''General [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]]'''\n*'''[[Eddie Byrne]]''' as '''General [[Vanden Willard|Willard]]'''\n*'''[[Drewe Henley|Drewe Hemley]]''' as '''[[Garven Dreis|Red Leader]]'''<ref name=\"Red Leader\">{{DB|character|redleader|Dreis, Garven (Red Leader)|archivedate=20110604050320}}</ref>\n*'''[[Denis Lawson|Dennis Lawson]]''' as '''[[Wedge Antilles|Red Two (Wedge)]]'''\n*'''[[Garrick Hagon]]''' as '''[[Biggs Darklighter|Red Three (Biggs)]]'''\n*'''[[Jack Klaff]]''' as '''[[John D.
